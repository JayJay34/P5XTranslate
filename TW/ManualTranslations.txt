……算，算了。\n你現在想必很困惑吧。=...... Count on it, count on it.\nYou must be very confused right now.
奇怪。按人類的標準來說，\n吾剛才的自我介紹應該是完美的啊……=Strange, by human standards, my introduction should have been perfect ......
嗯……\n你不叫吾的……名字嗎。=Hmmm ......\nDon't you call me by my ...... name.
令人在意的事情太多了……=So much to care about ......
呃……=Uh ......
人類的集體無意識……簡而言之，\n指的是「大眾的心靈世界」，這樣能理解嗎？=The collective unconsciousness of mankind ...... in short, refers to "the world of the mass mind", can this be understood?
在如今的現實世界中，\n各種各樣的「慾望」正在逐漸消失……=In today's real world, all kinds of "desires" are disappearing ......
為什麼會這樣……=Why is this happening ......
慾望喪失……？=Loss of Desire ......?
這個世界一副看起來隨時要崩潰的樣子，\n也是因為這個原因。=The world looks like it's about to fall apart at any moment, and that's why.
但是，你的慾望同樣也被「盜取」了。\n從現在開始，就由吾來引導你擺脫困境……=But your desires have been "stolen" as well, and from now on, I will guide you out of your predicament. ......

被發現了是指？=What do you mean, discovered?
就算你這麼說……=Even if you say so ......
有些人覺得「這也沒辦法吧」就放棄了，\n違背自身想法，所以導致意志漸漸消失。=Some people think, "There's nothing we can do about it," and give up, which is contrary to their own thinking, and so their will fades away.
……當然，\n這並不是說世界馬上就會終結。=...... Of course.\nThis is not to say that the world is going to end anytime soon.
你應該也親眼看到了吧？\n喪失最後一絲希望的人，會做出什麼事。=You've seen for yourself what people do when they lose their last hope.
如果選擇放棄，或者慾望被誰給盜取……\n人類究竟會變成什麼樣子……=If you choose to give up, or if your desires are stolen by someone ...... What will become of mankind ......

總覺得發生過……=It always feels like it happened ......
想起了一些事情……=Thinking about something ......
但這一狀況，確實在一步步腐蝕著人類，\n將世界推向末日。=But this state of affairs is indeed corrupting mankind step by step and pushing the world towards the end.
而「慾望被盜取」的原因是……=And the reason for the "theft of desire" is ......
但是，它們還沒有呈現出本來的樣子。\n這是因為受到了現實中「某人」的強烈影響。=However, they are not yet what they are, because they are strongly influenced by "someone" in reality.
他們是「陰影」，簡單來說就是敵人，\n是來取吾等性命的。=They are the Shadows, in short, the enemy, who have come to take our lives.
正是人類慾望被盜取的原因之一！=It is one of the reasons why human desires are stolen!
總之，你快逃吧！=No. 1, run away!
吾即是汝=I am thou.
來吧 簽訂契約吧=Come on, sign the contract.
從現在起 命運之紐帶已將吾等二人緊緊連結=From now on, we are bound together by the bonds of destiny.

在這個慾望被榨取的世界中，\n每個人都很難找到自我……=In a world where desires are squeezed out, it's hard for everyone to find themselves ......
人格面具指的是「另一個自己」……\n當人類選擇直面自身真正慾望時，即會顯現。=The mask of personality refers to the "other self" ...... which is revealed when a human being chooses to face his or her true desires head on.
沒錯，\n就是你剛才展現出來的那股力量。=That's right.\nIt's that power you just showed.
是指亞諾希克？=You mean Janosik?
人格面具？=Personality masks?
本來打算按照順序啟蒙你入門，但沒想到，\n你居然以一己之力覺醒了<color\=#ff0000>人格面具</color>……=I had intended to initiate you in the order of your initiation, but I didn't expect that you'd actually awakened on your own!<color\=#ff0000>Mask of Personality</color>……
總算有驚無險地結束了。=It's finally over with a bang.
你再也不是「被盜取慾望」的一方了。=You are no longer the one whose desires are being stolen.
趕緊走吧。=Let's go.

的確如此……=Indeed ......
吾若死於此地，\n也就無法回答你的問題了。=If I die here.\nI wouldn't be able to answer your question.

嗯，你還算明事理。=Well, you're sensible.
雖然什麼也沒弄明白……\n但先追上路菲爾吧……=I don't understand anything ...... but let's catch up with Luffy first ......
人格面具……印象空間……\n陰影……？=Personality Masks ...... Impression Space ......\nShadows ......?
剛才的戰鬥應該驚動了其他敵人，\n儘快離開為好。=The battle should have alerted the other enemies, so it's best to leave as soon as possible.

先給你這個。=I'll give you this first.
接近出口了。=Approaching the exit.
什麼意思？=What do you mean?
這附近？=This neighborhood?
不過，看來它與這附近慾望被盜取一事，似乎淵源頗深啊。=However, it seems to have a deep connection with the theft of desire in this neighborhood.
……啊，不對，和預想的不一樣。\n這傢伙不是吾感知到的東西。=...... Ah, no, it's not what I expected. This guy is not what I perceived.
哦！？=Oh!?
吾知道你就在那裡……再躲躲藏藏的話，就太不像樣子了。=I know you are there ...... It would be unseemly to hide anymore.
等一下。=Wait a minute.
應該馬上就能出去了……=Should be out in no time ......
異世界和現實世界，\n是平行並存並相互連接的，也就是說……=The other world and the real world are parallel and interconnected, that is to say ......
擊敗謝迪姆=Beat Sheldim.
劇情動畫：初見謝迪姆=Drama Animation: First Look at Sheldom
但看這個架勢，想必不是個好對付的傢伙。=But judging by this, it must not be a good guy to deal with.
……哦，看來你想到什麼了。=...... Oh, I see you've thought of something.
要奪回慾望=To take back the desire.

的確如此……=Indeed ......
吾若死於此地，\n也就無法回答你的問題了。=If I die here.\nI wouldn't be able to answer your question.
吾知道你還有很多疑問……\n但眼下離開這裡是首要的。=I know you have a lot of questions ...... but right now getting out of here is a priority.

嗯，你還算明事理。=Well, you're sensible.
雖然什麼也沒弄明白……\n但先追上路菲爾吧……=I don't understand anything ...... but let's catch up with Luffy first ......
人格面具……印象空間……\n陰影……？=Personality Masks ...... Impression Space ......\nShadows ......?

不過，看來它與這附近慾望被盜取一事，似乎淵源頗深啊。=However, it seems to have a deep connection with the theft of desire in this neighborhood.
……啊，不對，和預想的不一樣。\n這傢伙不是吾感知到的東西。=...... Ah, no, it's not what I expected. This guy is not what I perceived.
哦！？=Oh!?
吾知道你就在那裡……再躲躲藏藏的話，就太不像樣子了。=I know you are there ...... It would be unseemly to hide anymore.
等一下。=Wait a minute.
應該馬上就能出去了……=Should be out in no time ......
異世界和現實世界，\n是平行並存並相互連接的，也就是說……=The other world and the real world are parallel and interconnected, that is to say ......

幹得不錯嘛。=Nice work.
……難，難道最近的人類都不用這個詞了嗎？\n看來吾的知識也有必要升級了……=......難，難道最近的人類都不用這個詞嗎？來來吾的知識也需要提升了......
意、想、以、外！\n就是「出乎意料」的意思。=It means "out of the blue".
什麼？=What?
……意想……？=...... intended ......?
真是完美的致命一擊。\n這場戰鬥……出乎吾的意想以外。=It was a perfect fatal blow, and the battle ...... was beyond my expectations.
還想著如果順利的話，能見到那傢伙呢……=I was thinking that if things go well, I'll be able to meet that guy. ......
不過借此機會……得知了你的實力，\n也不枉此行。=But this opportunity ...... to learn about your strengths, it is not worth the trip.

……不對，\n吾能感到那個陰影沒有敵意。=...... No.\nI can feel that the shadow is not hostile.
陰影！？=Shadow!
這些傢伙被強烈慾望所吸引，橫行於異世界。\n所以即便是人類……=These guys are attracted by a strong desire to roam the other world, so even the human ......

對於陰影，仍然存在很多謎團。=There are still a lot of mysteries about The Shadow.
這真的是陰影？=Is this really a shadow?
看起來像人類……=Looks human ......
只要這個人類擁有足夠的慾望，\n便足以令陰影臣服，或與它進行交易。=If the human possesses enough desire, it will be enough to subjugate the Shadow or make a deal with it.
看起來它是想向吾等兜售那些物品。\n可真是個熱衷做生意的陰影啊。=Looks like it's trying to sell us those items. what an eager businessman Shadow.

不是……你怎麼一副「初次見面」的表情呢。\n吾等已經是見過彼此人格面具的關係了吧？=Why do you look like it's the first time you've met me? We've already seen each other's masks, haven't we?
吾來給你解釋一下。\n在異世界裡，受到吾等的強烈慾望影響……=I'll explain it to you. In the other world, influenced by our strong desire ......
……你很在意衣服變了嗎？=...... Do you care if your clothes change?
衣服也恢復原樣了……=The clothes are back to their original state ......

沒錯。\n吾正是路菲爾。=That's right.\nI'm Luke Fellows.
為什麼是貓頭鷹！？=Why the owl!
這個樣子……=This look ......
首先，異世界中的服裝之所以會變化，\n是由於本人擁有強烈的「慾望意志」。=First of all, the reason why the costumes change in the other world is because the person has a strong "will to desire".
呃，所以說啊，\n吾剛才正想說這個來著……=Uh, so.\nI was just about to say that. ......
再者，當吾等被陰影認知為敵人時，\n便會換上的心之鎧甲……你可以這樣理解。=Furthermore, the armor of the heart ...... that we change into when we are recognized as enemies by the shadows can be interpreted in this way.
……嗯，吾也不是什麼都知道。\n也有人說這彰顯的是反叛的精神。=...... Well, I don't know everything. Some say it shows the spirit of rebellion.

還有事情想問你……=There is something else I would like to ask you ......
你要走了？=You're leaving?
抱歉，今天先解散吧。\n畢竟吾可不想引人注目。=I'm sorry, let's call it a day, but I don't want to stand out after all.
現實世界和異世界中的服裝不同，\n就是因為以上理由……=Costumes in the real world and the other world are different for the above reasons ......
吾還有自己想要調查的事情。\n待完成調查後，會再來找你的。=I have something else I want to investigate, and I'll come back to you when I'm done.

忠告？=Advice?
你發現的可能性，\n是對無意識深處「生命」的渴望……=The possibilities you discover are a longing for 'life' in the depths of unconsciousness ......
正因為它是每個人生來就有的想法，\n因此也是最容易被遺忘的原始慾求。=It is precisely because it is an idea that every human being is born with, and therefore it is the most easily forgotten primitive desire.
開什麼玩笑？=Are you kidding me?
毀滅？=Destroy?
您最終將走向「<color\=#ff0000>毀滅</color>」。=You're finally on your way to "<color\=#ff0000>destruction</color>」。

所遺忘之「慾望」的可能性。=The possibility of the forgotten "desire".
而你那充沛的活力，\n隱藏著能夠喚起除自身以外、其他人的……=And your energy hides the ability to evoke something in others besides yourself. ......

早安……=Good morning ......
……早安。=...... Good morning.
