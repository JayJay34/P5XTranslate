果然 就是你吧=I'm glad it was you after all.
按照約定  吾來見你了=I have come to see you as I promised.
给你一个忠告吧=I have one piece of advice for you.
沒有覺察到自己的能力和原本就不具備能力 這是兩回事=What you can't see and what you don't have are two different things.
但吾希望 你會是前者 這是吾的慾望=I have a desire for you to be the former.
什麼情況=What's going on?
真的危險=It's dangerous.

First Metaverse
----------
這裡是……=This is...
我應該是在電車上吧……\n然後有人騎車衝過來……=I think I was on the subway... then someone on a bike rushed at me...
以隨機入侵而言……\n你倒是選了個好地方。=For a random infiltration... \nYou sure picked a good spot.
仔細一看，你還是挺有氣質的嘛。=On closer inspection, \nyou've got a pretty solid look.
你是誰？=Who are you?
什麼東西！？=What!?

Choice 1
……嗯，意識還很清醒。=...Hmm, still fully conscious.
Choice 2
這也算是正常反應吧。=That's a natural reaction.

逐漸產生「求知慾」，是個好兆頭。\n{{A}}，這才值得吾親自來見你。=You're developing a "desire for knowledge", a good sign indeed. {{A}}, this alone makes my visit worthwhile.
sr:"^吾知道你的名字，\n是(.*)對吧？$"="I know your name.\nIt's $1, right?"
叫吾{{A}}就好。\n記得發音要充滿敬意啊。=You may call me {{A}}, ensure you say it with the reverence it deserves.
令人在意的事情太多了……=Too many to care about...
嗯……\n你不叫吾的……名字嗎。=Hmm...\nWill you not speak my name?
奇怪。按人類的標準來說，\n吾剛才的自我介紹應該是完美的啊……=Strange. By human standards, my introduction should've been flawless...
……算，算了。\n你現在想必很困惑吧。=...Never mind. \nYou're still confused, I take it.
但是現在時間有限。\n吾就單刀直入地說了。=But time is limited. \nI'll explain this plainly.
這裡不是你所熟悉的現實世界……\n而是另一個空間，「{{A}}」。=This is not the real world you know... but another dimension, "{{A}}".
人類的集體無意識……簡而言之，\n指的是「大眾的心靈世界」，這樣能理解嗎？=The collective unconscious of humanity... In short, think of it as "the mental world of the masses", does that resonate?
在如今的現實世界中，\n各種各樣的「慾望」正在逐漸消失……=In the real world now, all sorts of "desires" are withering away...
這個世界一副看起來隨時要崩潰的樣子，\n也是因為這個原因。=This world ominously appears to verge on collapse, and that's precisely why.
慾望喪失……？=Loss of desires...?
為什麼會這樣……=Why is this happening...
……你現在懷有的「求知慾」也是如此……=...The same goes for that "desire for knowledge" you're feeling right now...
如果它們全都在不知不覺中，\n被人給「盜取」了呢？=What if they're all being "stolen" right under our noses?
……信不信由你。=...Believe it or not.
但是，你的慾望同樣也被「盜取」了。\n從現在開始，就由吾來引導你擺脫困境……=But your desires have been stolen as well. From now on, I'll guide you out of this mess...
……似乎被發現了。\n吾等換個地方再說。=...Looks like we've been spotted. Let's find somewhere else to talk.
首先要做的是離開這裡。\n之後就邊走邊說吧。=First things first, let's get out of here. We can talk as we go.
就算你這麼說……=Even if you say so...
被發現了是指？=Being spotted?
好了，快跟上。\n現在把吾當成同伴就好。=Alright, hurry up. For now, just treat me a teammate.
雖然還不太明白……但感覺非走不可了。=Although I still don't quite understand... I feel like I have to leave.

之前也說過了，在現實世界中，\n人們的「慾望」正在被盜取。=Like I said before, in the real world, people's "desires" are being stolen.
你沒有感覺到嗎？=Don't you feel it?
有些人覺得「這也沒辦法吧」就放棄了，\n違背自身想法，所以導致意志漸漸消失。=Some people think, "It can't be helped" and just give up. They go against their own beliefs, losing their will.
雖然提到慾望這個詞，容易有負面的印象，\n但它也是「生存的原動力」。=The word "desire" might carry a negative connotation, but it's also the very force that "drives us to live".
如果選擇放棄，或者慾望被誰給盜取……\n人類究竟會變成什麼樣子……=If you choose to give up, or if someone steals your desires... What will become of humanity...?
你應該也親眼看到了吧？\n喪失最後一絲希望的人，會做出什麼事。=You've seen it for yourself, haven't you?\n What people do when they lose their last shred of hope.
……當然，\n這並不是說世界馬上就會終結。=...Of course, that doesn't mean the world is going to end right away.
但這一狀況，確實在一步步腐蝕著人類，\n將世界推向末日。=But this situation is slowly eating away at humanity, dragging the world closer to ruin.
而「慾望被盜取」的原因是……=And the reason "desires are being stolen" is...
{{A}}，果然還是要來礙事……={{A}}, of course, they had to show up\nand ruin things...
他們是「陰影」，簡單來說就是敵人，\n是來取吾等性命的。=They are "Shadows". Basically, they are enemies, here to kill us.
這些傢伙沒有善惡之分，\n只會遵循慾望攻擊人類。=These guys don't care about good or evil, they just act on their desires and attack humans.
的確有違和感……感覺就像是，\n失去了心中重要的「一些東西」。=I can feel the sense of dissonance... It feels like losing "something" that is important.
想起了一些事情……=Remembered something...
總覺得發生過……=<size\=23>Feels like this happened before...</size>
這些傢伙是？=Who are these guys?
但是，它們還沒有呈現出本來的樣子。\n這是因為受到了現實中「某人」的強烈影響。=But they haven't shown their true forms yet. That's because they're heavily influenced by “someone” in the real world.
車站周圍的慾望會陷入枯竭，\n難道也是因為它們……？=Is the lack of desires around the station... because of them...?
莫非……=Could it be...
不會吧……=No way...
{{A}}，這些陰影……={{A}}, these Shadows...
正是人類慾望被盜取的原因之一！=That's one of the reasons people's desires are being stolen!
總之，你快逃吧！=Anyway, you run away!

糟了=Crap!
如果現在的你 並不是真正的你呢=What if the person you are now isn't the real you?
有必要提醒一下 你是可以選擇主動去溝通的=Don't forget, you can also choose to speak up.
你的東西被「盜取」了 那是本屬於你 只為你而存在的東西=You have something "stolen". Something that was meant only for you.
「無慾」有時會導致你放棄自己="Desirelessness" can sometimes mean giving up on oneself.
欺騙自己 選擇忘卻="The incident was fake". "Forget it".
不斷地放棄並無視自我的意志="Let's keep ignoring my own will".
現在的你 是如何「看待」自己=Is that how do you see yourself now?
如果要在此處迎來故事的結局 那也是你的選擇=What will you do? If this is where the story ends, then that is also your choice.
現在 再問你一次=Once again, let me ask you.
繼續作為「被盜取」的一方 放棄未來 甚至捨棄「生命」=Continue being "stolen" from, giving up on your future and even your "life".
這就是你的選擇嗎=Is that a good choice?
已經不會再捨棄了=<size\=30>I won't give up anymore</size>
要奪回一切=<size\=30>Have to take it all back</size>
這就對了 我就是想聽到這樣的選擇=That's right... That's the choice I wanted to hear!
難道=No way.

以你自身的意志與「無慾」訣別吧=Say goodbye to "desirelessness" with your own will.
既然已做出了選擇 那便一定能抓住它=Now that you have made your choice, you must seize it.
不用怕 即使遭遇他人非議也罷 只要你能看見 那就伸手去把握它=Don't be afraid. No matter what anyone says, if you can see it, grab it.
哈哈哈哈 沒想到終於能迎來「今日」=Hahaha, I can't believe it's finally "the day"!

謎之聲音=Mysterious Voice
吾名為<color\=#ff0000>{{A}}</color> 靠魅力統率狂暴慾望之人=My name is <color\=#ff0000>{{A}}</color>. The one who commands desires with charm.
從現在起 命運之紐帶已將吾等二人緊緊連結=From now on, we are bound together by the bonds of destiny.
來吧 簽訂契約吧=Now, sign the contract!
吾即是汝=I am thou!
汝即是……吾！=Thou art... I!
汝即是吾！=Thou art I!

你的樣子……\n充滿著對「生命」的強烈渴望……！=Your appearance... \nThe overflowing of desire for Life...!
雖說是多此一問，\n但你是已經決定「戰鬥」了吧？=There's no need to ask, \nyou've chosen to "fight", right?
{{A}}……與之前相比，\n完全變成另一個人了，不錯。={{A}}... You're like a completely different person now, not bad.
這是迎擊的姿態。\n為了殺掉吾等，它們要來真的了。=That's an attacking stance. \nThey really intend to kill us.
如果你不想死，\n那就用你手中的武器……=If you don't want to die,\nthen use the weapon in your hand...
斬碎敵人！=And slice them into pieces!
……你想怎麼處理那個傢伙？\n將你的慾望化為力量……在此釋放！=...How do you want to deal with that enemy? Turn your desires into power...!

總算有驚無險地結束了。=Done. And in one piece.
本來打算按照順序啟蒙你入門，但沒想到，\n你居然以一己之力覺醒了<color\=#ff0000>{{A}}</color>……=I fully intended to guide you through this in order, but I never expected you to awaken a <color\=#ff0000>{{A}}</color> on your own...
是指{{A}}？=You mean {{A}}?

Choice 1
沒錯，\n就是你剛才展現出來的那股力量。=Exactly, I'm talking about that power you just displayed.
Choice 2
如果你的力量有名字的話，那這就是了。=If your power has a name, then this is it.
{{A}}指的是「另一個自己」……\n當人類選擇直面自身真正慾望時，即會顯現。={{A}} is the "other self"... It is revealed when one faces their own true desires.
在這個慾望被榨取的世界中，\n每個人都很難找到自我……=In this world where desires are constantly being drained, it's hard for anyone to even find themselves...
{{A}}，果然吾沒有看走眼，\n你也許會成為這個世界的希望。={{A}}, indeed, my judgment was not mistaken, you may yet become the hope of this world.
你再也不是「被盜取慾望」的一方了。=You are no longer on the side that's "being stolen".
趕緊走吧。=Let's hurry.
這裡還是<color\=#ff0000>{{A}}</color>。\n隨時都會遭到陰影的襲擊。=This is still <color\=#ff0000>{{A}}</color>. A place where Shadows could attack at any moment.
陰影究竟是？=What are Shadows?
吾知道你還有很多疑問……\n但眼下離開這裡是首要的。=I know you have many questions... but escaping is our top priority right now.
吾若死於此地，\n也就無法回答你的問題了。=If I die here, \nI won't be able to answer your question.
的確如此……=Indeed...
首要任務是逃出去……=Escape comes first...
嗯，你還算明事理。=Hm, you are quite perceptive.
你能跑起來嗎？=Can you run?
剛才的戰鬥應該驚動了其他敵人，\n儘快離開為好。=Other enemies must have noticed that battle, we should hurry.
{{B}}……{{A}}……\n陰影……？={{B}}... {{A}}...\nShadow...?
雖然什麼也沒弄明白……\n但先追上{{A}}吧……=I don't understand anything... \nLet's catch up with {{A}}...

明明急著趕路……=We're in a hurry...
不過正好……\n吾來教你高效打倒敵人的辦法。=But this works out perfectly... Let me show you how to take them down efficiently.

戰鬥該怎麼來，\n看吾的動作，學好了。=This is how battles are fought, \nwatch and learn.
有些敵人有<color\=#ff0000>弱點</color>，\n吾等要瞄準弱點打倒它們。=Some enemies have <color\=#ff0000>Weaknesses</color>.\nBy targeting those weaknesses, you can effectively defeat them.

……啊，不對，和預想的不一樣。\n這傢伙不是吾感知到的東西。=...Ah, no, this isn't what I expected. This isn't the one I sensed.
不過，看來它與這附近慾望被盜取一事，似乎淵源頗深啊。=But, it seems deeply involved in the desires being stolen nearby.
這附近？=Nearby?
{{A}}和現實世界，\n是平行並存並互相連接的，也就是說……=The {{A}} and the real world exist in parallel and are linked, which means...
可能存在著……被這傢伙盜取了慾望、而在現實中被奪去生命的人類。=There might be humans... whose desires were drained by this thing, only to have their lives stolen in reality.

幹得不錯嘛。=Not bad.
真是完美的致命一擊。\n這場戰鬥……出乎吾的意想以外。=It was a splendid finishing blow. \nThis battle... was not foreknown.
……意想……？=...Foreknown...?
什麼？=What?
意、想、以、外！\n就是「出乎意料」的意思。=Fore-known!\nIt means "expected".
……難，難道最近的人類都不用這個詞了嗎？\n看來吾的知識也有必要升級了……=...Do people these days not use that word anymore? I need to improve my knowledge...
還想著如果順利的話，能見到那傢伙呢……=I was hoping to run into that guy, but...
果然要先收集情報啊。=As expected, I still need to gather information.
那傢伙……？\n{{A}}在這個世界找什麼人嗎？=That guy...? Is {{A}} looking for someone in this world?
不過，借此機會得知了你的實力，\n也不枉此行。=But, it was a great achievement to learn about your abilities.
這樣的話，\n馬上就可以給你委派<color\=#ff0000>工作</color>了。=If that's the case, \nI can entrust the <color\=#ff0000>work</color> to you right away.

看起來像人類……=Looks human...
這真的是陰影？=Is this really a Shadow?
對於陰影，仍然存在很多謎團。=There are still many mysteries surrounding Shadows.
它們的形態並不固定，\n有些好戰，也有些對人類比較友好。=Their forms are not fixed, some are belligerent, while others are friendly toward humans.
這些傢伙被強烈慾望所吸引，橫行於{{A}}。\n所以即便是人類……=They are lured by strong desires and run rampant in the {{A}}. Therefore, even if their target is human...
只要這個人類擁有足夠的慾望，\n便足以令陰影臣服，或與它進行交易。=Depending on the strength of their desires, it is possible to force Shadows into submission or even negotiate with them.
看起來它是想向吾等兜售那些物品。\n可真是個熱衷做生意的陰影啊。=It seems they're trying to push those goods on us. How mercantile of them.
之後若有時間，吾等自會來光顧。=If we have time, we will come to visit.

為什麼是貓頭鷹！？=Why an owl!?

Choice 1
{{A}}，所以說啊，\n吾剛才正想說這個來著……={{A}}, like I was trying to tell you earlier...
Choice 2
{{A}}，讓吾按順序說！\n不要那麼急性子。={{A}}, let me explain it step by step! Don't be so impatient.
首先，{{A}}中的服裝之所以會變化，\n是由於本人擁有強烈的「慾望意志」。=First, in the {{A}}, the transformation of one's garments symbolizes their formidable "will and desires".
再者，當吾等被陰影認知為敵人時，\n便會換上的心之鎧甲……你可以這樣理解。=When the Shadows mark us as enemies, we clad ourselves in the armor of the heart... You may see it thus.
……嗯，吾也不是什麼都知道。\n也有人說這彰顯的是反叛的精神。=...Hm, I don't know everything myself. Some even say it's an embodiment of the spirit of rebellion.
現實世界和{{A}}中的服裝不同，\n就是因為以上理由……=The reason our forms differ between reality and the {{A}}... is as I've described.
好奇的男性路人=Curious Male Passerby
那該不會是隻貓頭鷹吧？=Could that be an owl?
淡定的女性路人=Calm Female Passerby

你要走了？=You're leaving?
還有事情想問你……=I have things to ask...
這種求知慾是好事。\n但是你應該相當疲憊了吧。=Your desire for knowledge is commendable, but you're clearly exhausted.
覺醒了{{A}}，又經歷了剛才的戰鬥。\n先回去養精蓄銳吧。=Your {{A}} has awakened, and you've just been through a battle. Go back and recuperate your strength.
……不用擔心，很快就會再見面的。\n因為吾有想拜託你的「工作」。=...No need to worry, we'll meet again soon. I've got some "work" to ask of you, after all.
吾還有自己想要調查的事情。\n待完成調查後，會再來找你的。=I've my own investigations to attend to. Once concluded, I'll come to see you.
和{{A}}說的一樣，\n好像真的沒有什麼力氣了……=Like {{A}} said, I really don't have much energy left...

Choice 2
我不是說……要感謝你嗎？\n你可以直接從字面理解我的意思。=Didn't I say... I would like to thank you? You can take it at face value.

你發現的可能性，\n是對無意識深處「生命」的渴望……=The possibility that you discovered, is the thirst for "life" that lies in the depths of unconsciousness...
正因為它是每個人生來就有的想法，\n因此也是最容易被遺忘的原始慾求。=It is something that everyone naturally has, and therefore it is one of the most easily forgotten primitive desires.
而你那充沛的活力，\n隱藏著能夠喚起除自身以外其他人的……=That overflowing vitality is not just for yourself, but for others too...
所遺忘之「慾望」的可能性。=It has the potential to awaken forgotten "desires".
……因此，對於遲早要與你分別一事，\n我倍感遺憾。=...Therefore, I am sadden by the fact that we will inevitably part ways.
您最終將走向「<color\=#ff0000>{{A}}</color>」。=You are heading towards "<color\=#ff0000>Ruin</color>", I say.
開什麼玩笑？=Are you kidding me?
我不想 忘記你=I don't want to forget you!
剛才，好像看到了些什麼……=Just now, I think I saw something...
所以我才說……要給你個忠告吧？=I told you... I would give you an advice, right?
方才所說的另一種可能性。=Another possibility, as I mentioned earlier.
懷有慾望的人們之間深入的交往……\n互相孕育彼此心中的慾望。=Interaction between people with desires intertwined... Nurturing each others' desires.
你已經正要向我展示它了。=You have already tried to show me that.
互相孕育？=Nurturing each other?
沒聽懂=Don't understand
……{{A}}，現在理解不了也沒關係。=...{{A}}, you do not need to understand right now.
但倘若你要抗拒「{{A}}」，那麼……=But if you find "Ruin" hard to accept, then...
在這世間尋找懷有慾望之人，\n磨練你心中的慾望吧。=Seek out those who can harbor desires and strengthen the desires within you.
{{A}}，你來協助他。\n自己該負的職責……你應該理解吧？={{A}}, you should understand your role... In supporting him?
我是您的<color\=#ff0000>{{B}}</color>，{{A}}。=I will be serving as your <color\=#ff0000>{{B}}</color>，{{A}}.

啊，那{{A}}果然……\n是為了引誘{{B}}現身的圈套吧……！？=Ah, then {{A}} really... \nWas a trap to lure out the {{B}}...!?
喔……居然已經推測到這個地步了。\n好吧，作為獎勵，我就告訴你們。=Oh... You actually guessed that far. \nFine, as a reward, I'll tell you.
沒錯，{{A}}和{{B}}，\n都是為了調查你們而設下的「餌食」。=<size\=29>That's right, both the {{A}} and the {{B}} were "bait" to identify you.</size>
你這混蛋……\n不許把{{A}}叫做什麼「餌食」！=You... \nYou are not allowed to call {{A}} "bait"!
SOY，不要被他煽動。\n他是為了動搖我們才那麼說的。=Soy, don't fall for his words. \nWe should stay calm.
{{A}}，你們真的……很煩人啊……\n為什麼不乖乖上鉤，來糾纏我做什麼……！={{A}}, you are very annoying... Why don't you just take the bait instead of bothering me...!
我才不會被吃掉，我才是吃人的一方！=I'm not the one being eaten, \nI will stay on the eating side!
少得意忘形了=Don't get carried away
不存在被吃的一方=No side is being eaten
……不，你錯了，\n這個世界上是存在弱者的。=...No, that's not true. \nThere are clearly weak people in this world.
只不過，區分強者還是弱者的標準……\n不是權力，不是金錢，也不是暴力。=But what separates the strong from the weak... \nIs not power, money, or violence.
而是是否擁有「吞噬」他人的意志，\n這一點很重要哦。=It's whether or not you have the will to "devour" others. That's what's important.
{{A}}你在胡說什麼啊！={{A}} What are you talking about!
大眾都是一樣的哦。\n無時無刻不在想著怎麼吃人。=It's the same for the masses.\nAlways wanting to eat someone else.
撲到我為他們準備的名為「惡」的餌食上，\n譴責他人，並陶醉於正義的快感中。=<size\=29>They take the bait of "evil" I have prepared, condemn others, and revel in the pleasure of justice.</size>
惡人有惡報的情節，大家都很喜歡吧？\n仿佛自己就站在了正義的一方！=<size\=29>Everyone loves it when evil is punished, right? \nThe illusion of being on the side of justice!</size>
你們也是一樣……主觀上把我判定為惡人，\n將自身行為謳歌為正義，陷入自我陶醉………=<size\=29>You are the same... Singing about how wrong I am and how right you are, enjoying the incident...</size>
你什麼意思……？=What do you mean...?
{{A}}……所以，你們才在當什麼{{B}}吧？={{A}}... That's why you became {{B}}, right?
不對、不是那樣的！=No, it's not like that!
我們只是對你這種奪走人的慾望，\n侵犯他人利益的混帳玩意看不下去而已！=We just can't stand the sight of people who steal people's desires and devour them!
哎呀，小孩兒還是太嫩了呀，\n看來沒意識到這是「錯誤的正義」嘛。=Ah, you really seem to be a bit slow. You don't even realize that this is a "false justice".
別誤會，\n我可不屬於被吃掉的那一方哦？=I don't want you to misunderstand, \nbut I'm not on the side of being eaten.
我很清楚，這個世界不是吃人就是被吃，\n跟「正確」和「強大」都沒有關係。=<size\=29>I know very well that the world is eat or be eaten, it has nothing to do with "righteousness" or "strength".</size>
這傢伙……\n從剛才開始就在說什麼呢……？=What has this guy been saying all this time...?
小心，他在通過偷換概念進行心理誘導，\n這是詐騙犯常用的手法。=<size\=29>Be careful, changing the topic is a common tactic used by scammers to manipulate your psychology.</size>
混淆概念、偷換論點，\n想讓我們產生錯覺，認為錯的是自己。=<size\=29>They're trying to change the subject, to shift the argument, to make you feel like you're in the wrong.</size>
他就是這麼騙人的嗎=<size\=23>Is that how he deceives people?</size>
好狡猾的傢伙=Cunning guy
嗯，看來最好不要太當真啊。\n原本還想引出幕後推手的情報……=<size\=28>Yes, we should take this with a pinch of salt... I'd like to get some information about who's behind this, but...</size>
……說了這麼多，你們明白了嗎？=...Is that how you understand it?
犧牲掉的人，被選為食物……\n大眾享用過他的下場後，就會感到滿足。=<size\=28>The sacrificed people were chosen as food... After the public has enjoyed their fate, they will feel satisfied.</size>
然後他們就會讚美我，給我金錢和地位。\n而我就能盡情享用這一切。=Then they will praise me, give me money and status. And I can enjoy it all.
我可是食物鏈頂端的存在哦？\n這也意味著，在資本主義中，這就是正義！=I'm at the top of the food chain! \nThis is capitalist justice!
居然說這是正義……\n這種犧牲別人的做法不可能是正確的！=How can you say that's justice...\nSacrificing others isn't right!
{{A}}，就因為你們這麼想，\n所以你們才會被吃掉哦，{{B}}。={{A}}, just because you think so, that's why you will get eaten, {{B}}.
混蛋……！=You...!
CLOSER，這裡交給我。=Closer, leave it to me.
你說了那麼多大道理，\n但那只不過是自私利己的理論吧？=It may seem like a great principle, but what you say is just a selfish, self-centered theory.
你操縱大眾心理，獲得認同，\n只是沉醉於自己的主張而已。=<size\=29>You are just intoxicated by your claims, manipulating the psychology of the masses to gain their approval.</size>
……其實你早已意識到自己是「錯誤的」，\n但你一直不敢正視這一點。=...You know what you're doing is "wrong", but you keep turning your eyes away from yourself.
你犧牲了那麼多人的人生，\n無論你怎麼捏造和誘導……=You have sacrificed the lives of many, no matter how much you fabricate and induce...
唯獨這個「事實」，是絕對不會改變的。=The "fact" remains unchanged.
……這、微小的犧牲，卻滿足多數人的需求，\n這不是最棒的娛樂嗎。=...It's a small sacrifice that will satisfy the many, isn't this the best entertainment?
微小的犧牲？\n你把人的生命和情感當什麼了。=It's a small sacrifice, you say? \nWhat do you think of people's lives and hearts?
你只是把自己受過的痛苦，\n又施加給他人而已。=You are just taking out your pain on others.
你明知被人吃掉的痛苦，卻成為吃人的一方，\n只會把錯歸咎於別人，真是幼稚……=<size\=29>Even though you know the pain of being eaten, you turned to the other side and take out your anger on others, how childish...</size>
你……！=You...!
還說這跟人的強大無關？\n還要有吃掉別人的覺悟？全是胡說八道。=A person's strength doesn't matter? \nThey have the will to devour others? Nonsense.
當你面對「比自己強的人」時，\n你根本就不敢咬上去吧。=You simply can't hold your own against "someone stronger" than you.
不、不對……！=Wrong, wrong...!
哪裡不對，你全身被機械盔甲覆蓋的模樣，\n就是你自身軟弱的表現吧？=What's wrong. Covering yourself in mechanical armor, that's a sign of your own weakness.
你這種人，只會利用餌食引誘別人，\n自己好躲在暗中{{A}}地捕食……=People like you can only feed yourself by hiding and devouring others...
我不會再讓你吞噬人心了，\n也不會再讓你奪走別人的慾望！！=I will not let you devour others' hearts! \nI will not let you take away others' desires!!
帥、太帥了……=So damn cool...
完了……感覺要被WIND迷住了……=Oh no... I think I'm falling in love with Wind...
強詞奪理……你們這幫小鬼懂什麼！！=You twist my words... What do you kids know!!
哼！我就讓你們見識一下吞噬者的力量吧！\n就算那個女{{A}}沒派上用場……=Fine! I'll show you the power of the devourer! Even if that female teacher didn't work...
可是現在的我……有了新的動力源！=Now... I have a new source of power!
……嗯？電力供給怎麼了？\n搞什麼，發電廠什麼情況！？=...Huh? What happened to the power supply? \nWhat's going on at the Power Plant!?
喂，{{A}}他已經走了哦。=Yeah, the {{A}} is gone.
{{A}}的話，\n他早就回到自己的身體裡了哦～！={{A}} has already gone back to his body long ago～!
啊……！那個沒用的叛徒！！=Argh...! That useless traitor!!
果然沒有注意到嗎。\n看來收到吾等的預告後，內心相當動搖啊。=Apparently, he was quite upset by our Calling Card, he hadn't noticed.
……既然你想要吞噬我們的慾望，\n那就不要依賴他人，自己來怎麼樣？=...If you want to devour our desires, why not try it yourself instead of relying on others?
我來當你的對手=I'll be your opponent
哼！算了……這座水壩裡，\n應該還殘留著那個女人的「{{A}}」能量。=Hmph! Forget it... There should still be some leftover "{{A}}" energy from that woman.
我要使用全部動力……毀了你們！！！=I'll use all my energy... to destroy you all!!!

哼，只剩下這點能量了嗎……\n真是不省心啊。=Hmph, this is the only energy left...\nThat's annoying.
嗯，不過解決你們應該也夠用了。=Well, this should be enough to defeat you.
讓我來給你們好好指導吧。\n那麼，是誰這麼走運呢？=Let me give you a thorough consultation. \nWell then, who should I start with?
小心，{{A}}打算將我們逐個擊破。=Be careful, \n{{A}} is going to defeat us one by one.
WIND判斷的沒錯，\n被盯上的話，不要逞能，務必進行<color\=#FF0000>防禦</color>。=Wind is right. If you're targeted, \nyou have to <color\=#FF0000>guard</color> no matter what.
沒想到我還藏了這一手吧？\n{{A}}……力量再次湧入身體了呢~=You didn't expect this, right? \n{{A}}... I'm surging with power again～
如果讓他這樣攫取能量，\n我們沒有勝算……！=If we let him drain our energy, \nwe have no chance of winning...!

為什麼……不可能……明、明……\n我才是……吃人的吞噬者……=Why... Impossible... \nI'm the... Devourer...
錯的是你。=That way of thinking is wrong.
雖然我很同情你過去的遭遇……但反過來看，\n你應該比任何人都清楚成為犧牲品的痛苦。=While I sympathize with your past... But on the other hand, you should know the pain of being eaten better than anyone else.
為什麼你……沒有選擇去幫助他們，\n沒有站在遭受同樣痛苦的人的那一邊？=Why didn't... You redirect that to help the people who were hurting?
謬論，\n這只是你們這幫乳臭未乾的小鬼在妄想罷了。=That is just a fallacy, it is nothing more than an ideal that you young people often hold up.
人類是骯髒的……狡猾的……殘忍的……\n是一種最愛看他人不幸的生物哦。=Humans are dirty... Cunning... Evil... Creatures who desire misfortune of others above all else.
沒有那回事=That's not the case
你別擅自下結論=<size\=29>Don't jump to conclusions</size>
……你們說的，我一個字都不想聽。=...I don't want to hear a word you say.
因為「那個人」他說過……=Because "that person" said so...
回答吾，{{A}}！\n你說的「那個人」是誰！？=Answer me, {{A}}!\nWho is "that person" you're talking about!?
是誰把你送進{{A}}的……\n告訴我。=Who sent you to {{A}}...\nTell me.
……他是……=...He is...
{{A}}，剛才的聲音，哪裡來的！？={{A}}, what's that sound!?
喂……什麼東西……！？=Hey... What's that...!?
鯨……鯨魚……？=Wh-Whale...?
啊……我，啊這、這是……\n「這些傢伙」……不會是……=Ah... This is...\n"These guys"... It can't be...
怎麼會，這樣……\n你要，對我……不可能……！=Why... Are you doing... \nThis to me... Impossible...!

{{A}}……京……={{A}}... Kei...
官方認證的{{A}}……又多了1個人……=Again... another officially certified {{A}}...
啊、啊……{{B}}……{{A}}……=Ah! Ah... {{B}}... {{A}}...
這到底……！=What...!
{{A}}……被襲擊了……！？={{A}}... Is under attack...!?
啊，這不是……！\n和{{A}}暴走的時候一樣……=Ah, isn't this...! Just like when {{A}} suddenly changed...
{{A}}的慾望……\n被那群陰影強制暴走了……！？={{A}}'s desires... were forced out of control by those Shadows...!?
哈哈……哈哈哈哈哈哈哈！！=Haha... Bwahahahahaha!!
絕佳的力量啊……\n憎惡、怨恨、{{A}}……要溢出來了……！=What great power... Hatred... Resentment... {{A}}... Are overflowing...!
這什麼東西啊……也太大了吧！？=What happened to them...!!
人類慾望中的……負面情感……？\n{{A}}因此巨大化，連形態也變了嗎……！？=Is it the negative emotions... Of human desires...? \nThat caused {{A}} to grow and change...!?
我永遠都會是吞噬者！\n我會不停地吃、直到把一切都吞噬殆盡！=I will always be a devourer! I will eat and eat until I have devoured all!
正義，夢想，希望，還有愛，全部！\n吃掉對方的人才是贏家{{A}}！！=Justice, dreams, hope, and love, all of it! The winner is the one who eats the other!

吞噬一切……我會把你們都吃掉……=Devour all... I will devour you all...
一個不留！！=Leave nothing!!
{{A}}……這個混蛋，\n這個壓迫感和剛才完全不同了！={{A}}... This guy! \nthe pressure is totally different!
這種異常的破壞力……就算體型巨大化了，\n能量遲早也會被耗盡，他到底要做什麼……？=<size\=28>This abnormal destructive power... Even in this form, he would run out of energy soon. What is he trying...?</size>
{{A}}，充滿了能量的材料～！\n這裡不就有一個嘛。={{A}}, food that is full of energy～! \nThere's one right here.
那什麼東西啊……\n又耍這種卑鄙的手段！=What's that...\nUsing dirty tricks again!
豈有此理，\n減員的話對吾等不利。=This is bad. It would be disadvantageous if our numbers were reduced.
再這樣下去，我們就會變成{{A}}的動力源！\n需要儘快擊破那個裝置！=If this continues, we will become {{A}}'s power source! We have to destroy that device quickly!
耶，成功了！\n我看你還能怎麼樣！=Yeah, we did it!\nNow you can't do that again!
啊啊……竟敢妨礙我……！=You... Dare to interfere...!

打贏了！？=Did we do it!?
還、沒有結束……我要，吞掉一切……\n為了讓那些……那些啃食我的人遭到報應……=It's... Not over... I will devour all...\nThose who ate me... Will pay...
啊，請再多給我些力量吧！\n我能在這，都是因為您啊。=Hey, please give me more power!\nYou've brought me this far.
難道您……難道您……\n連我也要吞噬掉嗎{{A}}啊！！=You... Are you... \nGoing to devour me too!!
哈哈，嘻嘻嘻……嗚哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈！=Haha, hehehe... Bwahahahahahaha!
喂，怎麼回事{{A}}\n他剛才明明都快不行了，怎麼突然就……！？=Hey, what's going on?!\nHe was almost done for, why all of a sudden...!?
住手吧，{{A}}！\n再繼續放任陰影失控的話，你會沒命的！？=Stop it already, {{A}}! If you continue to let your Shadow go berserk, you yourself will die!?
嘻嘻……你是在……關心我啊……？\n關心嗎……我才不相信，不會相信呢……=<size\=30>Hehe... Are you... Worried about me...?\nWorried... I don't believe it, I won't believe it...</size>
這個世界上，只有吞噬者和被吞噬者……=In this world, there are only those who eat and those who are eaten...
因為相信別人……被看到自己弱點的話……\n就會被吞掉……會被那傢伙……還有她……=<size\=28>If you trust others... And showed your weakness... You will be eaten... by that guy... and her...</size>
你錯了！=You're wrong!
你可以相信別人！=You can trust others!
嗯，說得好，WONDER！=Yes, that's right, Wonder!
雖然你的{{A}}和戀人……背叛了你……\n可是！=It is true that your senpai and lover... \nBetrayed you... But!
這個世界上並不都是那種人！還有那種……\n僅僅因為是自己的學生，僅僅是這個理由……=<size\=29>The world is not full of such people! There are also those... Who just because we are their student, just for that reason...</size>
就拼命也要去保護對方的人存在！\n對你來說，一定也會有這樣的人！=They will desperately protect us!\nThere must be someone like that for you!
哈哈哈……真是孩子氣的想法。\n幼稚得令人作嘔……=Hahaha... What a childish idea.\nSo childish it's disgusting...
我啊，我已經……=For me, I...
什麼都不在乎了{{A}}……！\n因為我！已經！拋棄了所有！！=I don't care about anything anymore...! \nBecause! I've already! Thrown it all away!
吃掉吧吃掉吧吃掉吧！\n從他人身上奪走慾望，直到死亡！！=Eat, eat, eat! \nKeep taking away desires until death!
這、這是什麼情況……！？\n{{A}}怎麼突然……！=What's going on...!?\nWhy is {{A}} suddenly...!
這傢伙，該不會是……\n連自我都……「拋棄」了嗎……！？=This guy, it can't be...\nDid they even... "throw away" themself...!
吃掉吃掉全部都吃掉！\n我要把你們吃掉，一個都別想逃！=Eat, eat, eat, eat it all! \nI'm going to eat you all!
小心！那傢伙已經聽不進人話了……！\n他會無差別地奪走他人的生命！=<size\=28>Watch out! That guy won't listen to us anymore...! \nHe will take the lives of others without discrimination!</size>
拋棄自我……奪走……他人的生命……？=Throwing away themself... \nTaking away... The lives of others...?
啊，怎麼了！？=Huh, what's wrong!?
那個是……{{A}}……？\n怎麼是那個樣子……！=Is that... {{A}}...? \nWhat's happening...!
哈哈哈哈哈……！\n餌食來得正好啊！！=Hehehehehe...!\nYou blocked a good spot!!
喂……！陰影被他給……！？=Hey...! The Shadows were...!?
被……吃掉了……！？\n大家注意，{{A}}的力量正在膨脹！=They were... Eaten...!? Be careful everyone, {{A}}'s power is growing even more!
{{B}}……{{A}}！美味，美味啊……\n他人之不幸，於我甜如蜜糖啊！！=<size\=29>{{B}}... {{A}}! Delicious, delicious...\nThe misfortune of others is as sweet as honey!</size>
下一個，就輪到你們了啊！！\n全部去死……去死吧！！=Next, it will be your turn!! \nDie everyone... Die!!
糟了，如果被那電纜襲擊，\n即使是我們，恐怕也……！=This is bad, if that chord hits us, even we...!
大家，快躲避！=Everyone, take cover!
各自散開！=Scatter!

{{A}}……沒路走了……！={{A}}... There's no where to run...!
哇哈哈，嗚哈哈，啊{{A}}！！=Hehehe, hehehe, hahahahaha!!
不行……只能放棄對這傢伙的{{A}}了……=This is bad... we have no choice but to give up on his {{A}}...
你是說……！=You mean...!
{{A}}已經失控了……他的精神不會回歸了……\n而且……很可能還會危及生命……={{A}} is out of control... His spirit won't return... \nAt worse... it may even cost him his life...
如果不阻止他，\n現實世界中真的會有人被他殺死！！=If we stop him, people in the real world will actually be killed by him!!
必須……制止他……！=He must... Be stopped...!
毀掉……{{A}}的心……？=Destroy... {{A}}'s heart...?
真的沒有其他辦法了嗎……？=Is there really no other way...?
{{B}}，{{A}}……怎麼樣？\n露出更加絕望的表情吧……！={{B}}, {{A}}... What's wrong?\nPlease show a more desperate look...!
那種讓別人心碎的快感啊……\n好快樂，好快樂，快樂得不得了啊……=The pleasure of breaking someone's heart...\nHappy... So happy... So fun...
那個{{B}}沒出息的樣子，{{A}}！！\n真是美妙啊！！=That defeated teacher look, {{A}}!!\nIt's splendid!
啊！我們……只能動手了嗎……！=Damn! Do we... have no other way to stop this...!
毀掉……{{A}}的心嗎……\n可是那樣……現實中的{{A}}就會……=Destroy... {{A}}'s heart? \nBut then... The {{A}} in the real world...
……別在那做夢了。=...I won't let you.
哼……剛才我聽到你居然說，\n讓別人陷入不幸這件事「很快樂」。=<size\=30>What... Have I been hearing? \nYou think it's "fun" to let others suffer misfortune?</size>
還說，當人無路可走的時候……\n為了活著就得吃掉別人……！？=You even say, when people are cornered...\nThey will kill as many people as they can...!?
開什麼玩笑！！=What a joke!!
被你摧毀了內心的人！\n仍然在頑強地活著！！=The people whose hearts you broke! \nThey are still living strong!!
「並不是只有你一個人在痛苦」，\n我原本不打算再說這種話了，但是……=I'm not going to lecture you, \nsaying "you're not the only one suffering", but...
生而為人，會失去，會受傷，還要面對……\n被奪走一切的殘酷，就算這樣人也不會倒下。=Even if things are unfairly taken, or lost... \nEven so, people still stand up again and again.
不要小看了……\n這些人「想要活下去」的信念和尊嚴啊！！=The dignity of those people's desires "to live"... Don't make fun of them!!
WIND說的沒錯=Wind is right
不會讓你死的，{{A}}！=<size\=30>Won't let you die, {{A}}!</size>
{{A}}……咕……！={{A}}... Grrr...!
謝謝你，WONDER。\n你的話……總是能給我勇氣。=Thank you, Wonder. \nYour words... Always give me courage.
這……這是……？=This... Is...?
從WIND身上感覺到了強烈的慾望……\n萌生出某種……意志的力量……！=I can feel a strong desire from Wind...\nSome power of will... has sprouted in her...!
你想要拋棄自我，連生命和慾望都放棄吧，\n這種事，我不會允許的……！=Giving up on yourself, your life, and even your desires! I won't allow it...!
你要活著去贖罪。\n你沒有資格逃避。=You have to live and atone.\nI won't accept you running away.
而且，我絕對不會讓我重要的同伴們……\n讓{{A}}……背負上奪走你性命的罪行！=<size\=29>And I won't let my precious friends... The {{A}}... Carry the burden of taking your life!</size>
覺悟吧，{{A}}！=Get ready, {{A}}!
你想要拋棄自我……\n想要放棄生命的意志，會由我們「奪走」！=Your will to abandon yourself... and to give up on life, we will "take it away"!

這是=This is!
這……是什麼……\nWIND的狀態……好像變了！？=What is this... \nWind's form... Has changed!?
慾望的力量在膨脹……！WIND心靈的成長，\n難道對{{A}}和{{B}}也產生了影響……？=<size\=27>The power of desire is growing...! Did Wind's growth of heart affect her {{A}} and {{B}}...?</size>
心靈的成長……？那是什麼啊！=The growth of heart...? What's that!
{{B}}是心靈的力量……也就是說，\nWIND此刻處於與{{A}}失控相反的境地……=<size\=27>{{B}} is the power of the heart... That is to say, Wind is now the polar opposite of {{A}} going berserk.</size>
她的慾望同樣失控了，但她並非為自己，\n而是下定決心要拯救他人的「{{A}}」！=<size\=28>Her desires are also going berserk, but she is not doing it for herself. She is determined to save the "{{A}}" of others!</size>
{{A}}的……失控？=<size\=24>{{A}}... Going berserk?</size>
WIND，沒事吧！=Wind, are you alright!
身體，好燙……不過，現在的我，\n能夠站出來、幫助大家了……！=My body... So hot... But now, \nI feel like I can help everyone on the front lines.
可、那種失控的狀態……\n說明WIND她在勉強自己吧！？=But if her desires are going berserk...\nThen Wind is also pushing herself!?
嗯，應該是無法持續太久的，\n要動手的話，只能速戰速決了！=Yes, it may not last long. If we do it, we have no choice but to aim for a quick victory!
什麼生命啊……慾望啊……\n這些東西，我全部全部都要毀掉！！=What life... What desires...\nThese things, I will destroy them all!!
{{A}}……「拯救」你這種漂亮話，\n我說不出口。={{A}}... I'm not going to say some fancy words \nlike "I'll save you".
但是，我們還是不會放棄你的，\n因為{{A}}……也曾經這樣幫助過我。=But, we will not abandon you. \nJust like when teacher reached out to me.
你休想……放棄自己的慾望！\n我要堂堂正正{{A}}！=Don't you dare... Give up your desires! \nI'll face you head on and {{A}}!

{{A}}……\n我絕不會是被吞噬的一方……={{A}}...\nI will never be on the devoured side...
被吃掉……被踐踏……我不要！！=Eaten... Trampled... I don't want it!!
{{A}}！混蛋，看我們怎麼把你打下來！={{A}}! You, we'll drag you down from the sky!
別衝動，{{A}}現在的狀態很不穩定，\n我們最好不要貿然出手。=Calm down, {{A}} is in a very unstable state right now. It would be best not to act rashly.
吾贊成WIND的判斷，\n這種情況優先考慮保全自身。=I agree with Wind's judgment, \nour priority right now is to protect ourselves.
一邊防禦一邊看準時機就行了吧……！\nWIND，你出戰真的沒關係嗎！？=It's about guarding and waiting for an opening...!\nWind, is it really okay for you to fight!?
嗯，我反而「看」得更清楚了。\n而且我也能一邊戰鬥一邊支援大家！=Yes, I can "see" more than usual. \nNow I can fight and support everyone!
他的動作……不對！大家小心！=His movements... No way! Everyone be careful!
我要毀了你們！=I will destroy you all!
我的……都是我的啊……=All mine... It's all mine...
{{A}}……\n我們該不會跟那些陰影一個下場吧……=<size\=30>{{A}}... We won't end up like those Shadows, right...</size>
持久戰對吾等不利，\n考慮集中火力，一口氣解決吧。=<size\=30>We have no chance of winning if this becomes a prolonged battle. We have no choice but to launch a concentrated attack.</size>
等等，也許也有別的選擇……！\n大家看看那邊！=Wait, there may be another way...! \nEveryone, look over that!
啊，透過擊中那東西來攻擊{{A}}吧，\n這個方法可以！=<size\=29>I see, we can use that giant thing to attack {{A}}!\nGood idea!</size>
確實也不失為一種應敵策略，\n選擇就交給隊長判斷了！=It's certainly not a bad strategy,\nthe decision is up to the leader!
{{B}}……{{A}}……被吃掉嗎……\n我總是……勝利者……={{B}}... {{A}}... Getting eaten...\nI'm always... The winner...
與其被吃掉……我寧願放棄所有……！！=As long as I can eat... \nI don't need anything else...!!
{{A}}已是強弩之末，但他失控的程度已經超出他的極限……！={{A}} has reached his limit, \nbut even he can't stop this berserk...!
嗯，吾估計他想要與吾等同歸於盡。\nWIND，有什麼對策嗎？=Yes, I think he wants us to perish together.\nWind, what's the plan?
在{{A}}的力量膨脹到無法抵抗之前，打倒他。\n大家，速戰速決！=<size\=29>We have no choice but to defeat {{A}} before his powers grow out of control. Everyone, blitzkrieg!</size>
{{B}}，全都去死吧，{{A}}！\n我要吃……不夠不夠！還不夠！={{B}}, let's go together, {{A}}! \nI have to eat... Not enough! Not enough!
他開始發瘋了嗎……！！\n我們得再快點！=Is he going crazy...!!\nWe have to hurry!
還差一點……我的力量就充滿了……\n嘻嘻……哇哈哈……{{A}}！=Almost... My power is almost full...\nHehe... Wahaha... {{A}}!
時間不多了！但我們……\n會堅持到最後一刻的，對吧，WONDER！=There's no time left! But we...\nWon't give up until the end, right? Wonder!

要我活下去……？事到如今……\n被我吞噬掉的人卻要我活著嗎……？=Want me to live...? After all that...\nThe people I've devoured want me to live...?
那種滋味……不……我做不到……=How... Impossible... I can't...
不要隨便就對自己下定論。=Don't assume it's impossible.
你的所作所為……我是不會原諒的，\n於情於理我都沒有想過救你……=Of course I have no intention of forgiving what you did, and I never thought of saving you...
但是我知道，人是可以改變的。=But I know that people can change.
雖然不甘心，但確實是因為你，\n還有{{A}}……我才能做出改變。=I'm not happy about it, but thanks to your misdeeds and {{A}}... I've changed.
所以，我們不會放任你自生自滅。\n為了贖罪……你也必須要活下去。=So, we reach out to you. In order to atone for your sins... You must continue to live.
哈哈……這麼嚴格嗎……\n真是可怕的……慾望……=Haha... There's no trace of kindness...\nWhat a horrifying... desire...
因為我恨你。=Because I hate you.
{{A}}，這麼直接！={{A}}, that's straightforward!
但……我要你活著，要你不拋棄自我，\n這是我忠於慾望的答案。=<size\=29>But... I want you to live, I don't want you to abandon yourself, that's the answer true to my desires.</size>
忠於慾望……嗎……哈哈……=True to your desires... I see... Haha...
我……是從哪一步……走錯的……呢……=Where... Did I... Go wrong...
噢，恢復成原樣了……=Oh, are they back to normal...
唔，那副樣子的話，\n現實中的{{A}}應該不會有生命危險了。=Hm, from the look of things, \nthe real {{A}} shouldn't be in danger.
太好了……就算我們是怪盜，\n也絕對不想傷害到人的生命啊……=That's great... Even if we are Phantom Thieves, \nwe definitely don't want to take someone's life...
你們怎麼回事……\n嘴上說不會原諒我，現在卻又救我……=What's this... You say you can't forgive me, \nbut you still want to save me...
像是一出幼稚噁心的青春劇……=Like a childish and disgusting teen drama...
你不也是嘴上這麼說，其實這個題材，\n你很喜歡吧？就像你的節目策劃案一樣……=You say that but you really like that genre, don't you? It's just like your program proposals...
{{A}}！那個社團活動對抗戰的節目！\n我可喜歡看了！=<size\=30>{{A}}! That clubs versus show! I loved watching it!</size>
部長跟部員之間的矛盾、還有感動……\n每週都讓人熱血沸騰啊！=<size\=27>The conflicts between the president and their members, as well as the emotions... Every week is exciting!</size>
……那個案子早就被搶走了，\n從頭到尾我根本就沒參與過。=...That project was stolen from me, \nI didn't write anything.
但是……嗯。\n……那個……是我想做的……=But... Yes.\n...I wanted... To make that...
小時候我身體不好……去不了學校……\n所以對那種青春……一直很嚮往……=I used to be sick... And couldn't go to school... \nSo I always longed for... That kind of youth...
我想在電視上……給像我一樣……\n躺在病床上的孩子們……帶去一點青春……=<size\=28>I wanted to bring a little bit of youth... To the children who were sick... Just like me through television...</size>
很棒的……節目吧……\n真想自己……製作啊……=It's a great... Show...\nI wish... I could've produced it myself...
那個東西……\n是節目獲得社長獎的獎盃呢。=That is... \nThe president's award trophy for that show.
雖然被人奪走了……\n但也是我想出來的節目獲獎了……=He took it away... \nBut the show I came up with won an award...
……我們拿走了哦=...We're taking this
我們可以奪走嗎？=Can we take it?
嗯，請吧……=Yes, please...
想來，\n我就是因為這件事變得扭曲了吧……=Thinking about it,\nI guess that's why I became distorted.
拋棄了一切……\n我一直都恨不得一死了之。=I've always wanted to... \nThrow everything away and die.
可是……當時多虧了「那個人」……\n我才想要……活下去……=But... Thanks to "that person"...\nI wanted... To live...
好像現在的我，從你們那……\n獲得了活下去的慾望一樣……啊……=It's just like you...\nGave me the desire to live now...
啊，消失了……！=Ah, disappeared...!
{{B}}，還是沒能打聽到「那個人」是誰啊……\n不過，至少{{A}}不會死了吧？={{B}}, I guess we didn't get to hear about "that person"... But at least {{A}} won't die, right?
嗯，應該趕上了，不過吾認為，\n還是有必要確認一下現實中{{A}}的情況……=Ah, we made it on time. But I think it is still necessary to confirm {{A}}'s situation in reality...
那傢伙應該是取得了{{A}}後才消失的。\n這也是WONDER和WIND的功勞。=He must have regained his {{A}} and vanished. Thanks to Wonder and Wind.
但願如此……嗚！=I hope so... Aagh!
WIND！你沒事吧？=Wind! Are you alright?
你沒事吧！？=Are you alright!?
不要勉強自己=Don't push yourself
謝謝，我沒事，只是有點虛弱，\n可能是在剛才的戰鬥中消耗太大了。=<size\=29>Thank you, I'm fine. I'm just a bit tired. \nMaybe I over exerted myself from the battle earlier.</size>
「{{A}}」……這種力量，\n看來果然不是輕易能發揮出來的。="{{A}}"... It seems like that's not a power that can be used all the time.
唔，我還挺得住。\n我們還要去拿{{A}}的{{B}}。=Yes, we have to make one more push. \nWe have to get {{A}}'s {{B}}.
嗯，可是……奪走{{B}}的話，\n{{A}}就會崩塌吧。=Yes, but... If we steal the {{B}}, \nthe {{A}} will collapse.
那就只能先拿了{{B}}，\n然後一口氣跑到{{A}}那邊？=Once we steal {{B}},\nwe go straight to {{A}}'s Treasure?
感覺距離好遠啊，\n不過CATTLE開快點的話說不定……趕得上？=It feels like it's quite a distance away, \nif Ruferu flies... Maybe it'll work out?
{{A}}……吾可以試試看，\n不過吾現在也相當疲憊了啊……={{A}}... I can try it, \nbut I'm also pretty exhausted now...
{{A}}，我其實也是……\n唔……有沒有什麼好辦法……=Right, me too... \nHmm... Is there a good way to do this?
同時奪取兩個{{A}}=<size\=26>Take both {{A}}s at once</size>
……{{A}}？什麼意思？=...{{A}}? What does that mean?
你看來有想法了吧，說來聽聽？=You seem to have an idea, let me know.
WIND，你還飛得動嗎？=Wind, can you still fly?
喂，可是，{{A}}也很累了吧……？=Hey, but, senpai is tired too...?
沒關係，都到這裡了我們就堅持到底吧。\n你看來有想法了吧，說來聽聽？=<size\=30>It's okay. We've come this far, let's see it through. \nDo you have any ideas? Let me know.</size>

能聽見嗎？這邊已經抵達指定位置。=I can hear you. We're in position.
嗯，再確認一下作戰計畫。\n奪走{{B}}之時，{{A}}就會開始崩塌。=Well then, let's confirm the plan. The moment we steal the {{B}}, the {{A}} will collapse.
所以此次吾等分成兩組、務必同時奪取{{B}}，\n然後以最快速度離開{{A}}，沒問題吧？=<size\=29>Therefore, the two teams need to steal the {{B}} at exactly the same time and escape as quickly as possible, understand?</size>
嗯，沒問題，那就開始行動吧！\nCATTLE，啟動引擎吧！=Okay, let's get started!\nCattle, start the engine!
收到！行動開始！=Copy that! Let's go!

這是什麼？=What's this?
莫非是{{A}}的……=Could it be {{A}}'s...
{{A}}的{{B}}呢？=<size\=18>What about {{A}}'s {{B}}?</size>

{{A}}她對我有恩，\n是我尊敬和嚮往的人啊。={{A}} helped me in the past and has been kind to me. She's someone I respect and look up to.
那不是禁忌嗎……=Isn't that a taboo...
真的僅僅是尊敬嗎？=Really just respect?
謔……如果主角是怪盜，那吾等也要看看。\n或許能夠作為工作上的參考啊。=Oh... If a Phantom Thief is the main character, I would like to read it. It might be a good reference for the work.
你真的辛苦了=<size\=28>Thanks for the hard work</size>
今天解散回去休息吧=Let's call it a day

也許會真正{{A}}……？=Maybe a real {{A}}...?
是因為那個陰影？=<size\=30>Because of that Shadow?</size>
是因為慾望被迫失控了？=<size\=23>The desires were forced out of control?</size>
「干涉」……\n好像在哪裡聽過這個詞……="Interference"... Feels like I've heard that before...
暫時就將其命名為「<color\=#ff0000>{{A}}</color>」吧。\n這些傢伙……很有可能……=Let's name it "<color\=#ff0000>{{A}}</color>" for now.\nThese guys... It's very possible...
確實說得通=It does make sense
是創造出來的……？=Created...?
絕對要阻止那個人=They must be stopped
那種人不可饒恕=Unforgivable

首先對你戰勝{{B}}與{{C}}、\n這兩{{A}}的慾望一事，送上讚賞……=First, I'd like to congratulate you on besting the {{A}} of {{B}} and {{C}}...
請允許我冒昧地代表{{A}}，為您鼓掌。=Allow me to applaud on behalf of the {{A}}.
{{A}}……{{B}}……{{C}}……{{D}}……={{A}}... {{B}}... {{C}}... {{D}}...
這是你所凌駕之人表現出的慾望。\n在社會之中被視為最應該規避的……=<size\=30>The desires of those you have surpassed are considered something to be avoided in this world.</size>
但只要為人，\n就無法避免最根源處的慾望……即{{A}}。=As long as one is human, one cannot escape from their root desires... The {{A}}s.
那麼……你知道嗎？\n人們能稱之為{{A}}的，其中之一為「{{B}}」。=Well... Do you know? \nOne of the {{A}} is called "{{B}}".
{{A}}，我想也是。\n你肯定……是知道的。={{A}}, just as I thought.\nOf course... You would know that.
哦？是這樣嗎？{{B}}，\n被稱作{{A}}的醜陋慾望，的確是存在的。=Oh? Is that so? {{B}},\nthe hideous desire called {{A}} does exists.
「{{A}}」……相比這個慾望枯竭的世界，\n那是個完全相反的存在，所以……你怎麼想？="{{A}}"... That is the polar opposite of this desire-depleted world. So... What do you think?
你認為如今的這個世界中……\n有可能存在「{{A}}」嗎？=Do you think there could be...\nA "{{A}}" in this world today?
我覺得有=I think yes
我覺得沒有=I think no
{{B}}……至今為止，與{{A}}的邂逅，\n使你產生了這樣的想法吧。={{B}}... Have your meetings with previous {{A}}s led you to such a conclusion?

{{A}}……我已經說過很多次了吧？\n我無法為你指明道路。={{A}}... I have told you many times right? \nI cannot show you the way.
因為你自己去了解，去做出的選擇，\n是很重要的。=It is important that you know for yourself and make your own choices.

有嗎……？=Is there...?
多虧了{{A}}=Thanks to {{A}}
因為他沒有拋棄慾望=<size\=26>He didn't give up his desires</size>
如果當時打倒了{{A}}……\n就會直接奪走他的生命……={{A}} would've died... \nIf we defeated him...
就算強行將他{{A}}，也可能……=Even if we forced a {{A}}, it's possible...
很可能就會導向最壞的結果，\n{{A}}，還有大家，都會被……=It's possible that would've led to the worst possible outcome. With {{A}}, and everyone, being...

看上去是的。=Looks like it.
唔……奇怪。=Hmm... Strange.
怎麼了，CATTLE，你有什麼預感嗎？=What's the matter, Cattle?
沒……沒什麼。=It's... Nothing...
可能是吾多想了吧。=Maybe I'm overthinking it.
算了，吾還是解釋一下吧。=Never mind, I'd better explain.
吾一進來時，感知到這個區域非常的巨大。=<size\=29>When we entered, I felt that this area was gigantic.</size>
但是看地圖卻感覺並不是這樣。=But looking at the map, that doesn't seem like the case.
我剛才又重新感知了一下，吾的感覺沒有錯。=I just sensed it again, and my feeling is not wrong.
這個區域的結構，\n可能比地圖上繪製的「<color\=#ff0000>更加複雜</color>」。=The structure of this area, it is very likely more "<color\=#ff0000>more complicated</color>" than the drawn map.
總之各位小心一點！=All in all, be careful!

地圖上顯示，這個地方有一個安全屋。=The map shows that there's a safe room here.
但是這個地方是完全封死的。=But this is completely sealed off.
打不開嘛……=Won't open...
那我們先去別的地方探索吧。=Let's explore somewhere else first.

這個門，打不開嗎？=Can't open this door?
地圖上顯示，這裡是可以通過的{{A}}。=The map shows that there's a passage here.
也許需要從另一側把門打開。=Maybe we have to open it from the other side.
不是的，SOY，CLOSER。=No, SOY, CLOSER.
吾感知到這個門後面，\n沒有任何怪物和寶物的氣息。=I sense there is no monsters or treasures behind this door.
那是剛才拿到的地圖錯了嗎？=Is the map we just got wrong?
以前從來沒有拿到過錯誤的地圖吧。=We've never gotten a wrong map before.
吾一直有一個疑惑。=I have always had a doubt.
這些房間在空間上真的在「<color\=#ff0000>同一層</color>」嗎？=Are these rooms really "<color\=#ff0000>on the same floor</color>"?
仔細觀察，小心探索吧，WONDER。=Watch closely. Explore carefully, Wonder.

前面看上去好像完全沒有路了，\n唯一的路也被「<color\=#ff0000>電子阻擋門</color>」擋住了。=Looks like there's no where to go, and the only path is blocked by an "<color\=#ff0000>electronic gate</color>".
稍等一下，CLOSER。=Wait a mininute, Closer.
這個門後面有一個識別開關，\n吾等可以利用機器人關閉它。=There is an identification switch behind this gate, \nwe can switch it off with a robot.
但是哪裡能找到機器人呢？=But where can we find a robot?
先用機器人的「<color\=#ff0000>操控台</color>」試一試吧，\n也許吾等就能找到機器人的位置了。=First use the robot's "<color\=#ff0000>Console</color>",\nmaybe we'll be able to find the robot's location.
嗯，WONDER，交給你了。=Well, Wonder, we will leave it to you.

這個房間我總感覺我們來過，\n一個一模一樣的房間。=I feel like we've been to this identical room before.
我也有同樣的預感。=I feel the same.
感覺不太對……=Something feels off...
這個房間的謎題，怎麼感覺發生「<color\=#ff0000>變化</color>」了？=The puzzle of this room. \nWhy does it feel it "<color\=#ff0000>changed</color>"?
剛才螢幕的分佈，好像不是這樣的。=The distribution of the screen just now doesn't seem to be this.
啊……好像確實不一樣了。=Ah... It seems to be different.
是房間自己復原了？還是其他的可能性。=Is it possible that the room fixed itself? Or somthing else.
不可能的。=Impossible
以前沒有類似的情況。=Never seen this before
這可能就是我剛才說的情況。=This may be what I just said.
仔細探查，小心前進吧。=Explore carefully. Proceed with caution.

在警察局附近「剛好」有殺人犯，\n{{A}}「剛好」經過那裡所以被殺。=There just "happened to" be a random murderer near the police station, and {{A}} just "happened to" walk by and got stabbed.
這真的只是偶然嗎？=Is it really just a coincidence?
如果正是因為他要去自首，\n所以才慘遭「滅口」呢……？=Isn't it possible that he was "silenced" because he was trying to turn himself in...?
被滅口……！=Silenced...!

也是{{C}}後的{{A}}和{{B}}所說的……\n「那個人」。=The one both {{A}} and {{B}} mentioned after their change of heart... "That person".
Choice 3
你不記得了嗎？\n{{A}}和{{B}}提到過的「那個人」。=Don't you remember? "That person" mentioned by both {{A}} and {{B}}.
扭曲了{{A}}們的慾望，\n製造出{{B}}的「幕後黑手」啊。=The "mastermind" who distorted {{A}}'s desires and created their {{B}}.

{{C}}受他指使潛入學校，\n故意把{{B}}塑造成{{A}}。={{C}} was ordered by the mastermind to infiltrate the school and purposely frame {{B}} as a {{A}}.
沒錯，\n是為了查我們{{A}}的身份吧。=Right, that was to figure out our {{A}}' identities, wasn't it?
但反而{{A}}卻被我們……\n被{{C}}{{B}}了。=But instead, {{A}} has a change of heart by us, the {{C}}.
考慮到{{A}}在失控前的言行，\n可能他從那時起就已經被拋棄了……=Considering {{A}}'s words and actions just before he went berserk, he may have been discarded at that point...
不管怎樣，他那段自白影片，\n一定也引起了幕後黑手的注意。=Either way, his confession video must have drawn the mastermind's attention.
然後那個人發現{{A}}已經被{{B}}，\n為了不暴露身份就下手滅口……吧。=Then that person realized {{A}} has a change of heart, and silenced him to avoid being exposed... right.
這麼說，殺害{{B}}的那個{{A}}，\n也是幕後黑手的手下嗎……？=So you're saying the {{A}} who killed {{B}} was also working under the mastermind...?
可是，就算是買兇殺人，\n也不可能直接在警察局門口動手吧！=But no one's stupid enough to kill someone right in front of a police station, even under orders!
不過，\n也許那個人真的具備如此強大的影響力呢。=But maybe that person is someone with that much influence.
啊，要是被他知道了{{A}}的身份，\n我們也會被……？=Ah, if he finds out who we {{A}} really are, we'll also be...? 
雖然還不知道幕後黑手的真實身份，\n毫無疑問，他是個可怕的敵人。=The identity of the mastermind is still unknown, but there's no doubt that he's a fearsome enemy.
今後吾等必須更加謹慎行事。=We will have to proceed more carefully from now on.
不過……有這麼危險的人到處幹壞事，\n反而更需要我們{{A}}出手吧。=But... if there is someone like that running rampant, isn't it time for us, the {{A}}, to step in?
不如我們繼續攻略其他{{A}}，\n把他逼出來！=Why don't we keep taking down more {{A}}s and force him out!
說得也是。\n怪盜被壞人嚇倒，這不是搞反了嘛！=True! If the Phantom Thieves get scared off by bad people, that'd be totally backwards!
當然，吾也並不打算停止攻略{{A}}。\n但大家一定要加倍小心，沒問題吧？=Of course, I have no intention of stopping {{A}} infiltration, but we need to act more carefully than ever, understood?
現在已經拿到了四個{{B}}……\n還是想儘快找到下一座{{A}}……=We've already secured four {{A}}s...\nI want to find the next {{A}} soon...
嗯？\n怎麼了，{{A}}。=Hm? \nWhat's up, {{A}}.
那個……最近幾天，\n我可能都沒辦法在放學後參加行動了。=Well... I might not be able to join after school for a while.
{{A}}不在怎麼行！=<size\=28>Can't do this without {{A}}!</size>

Choice 2
真的很抱歉。\n可是……=I'm really sorry.\nBut...
……{{A}}的「學園祭」，\n不是馬上就要到了嗎？=...{{A}}'s "school festival" is coming up soon, right?

今年好像會特別忙。\n所以放學後我應該騰不出時間來……=This year is going to be pretty busy. So I don't think I'll have time after school...
學園祭啊……好像的確到時候了。\n但{{A}}也會很忙嗎？=The school festival... Guess it is that time. But even the {{A}} gets busy?
當然。無論是準備期還是活動當天，\n雜事都比平時多了不少。=Of course it's going to be busy. There will be more problems than usual during the preparation period and on the day itself.
而且……\n這次還不止是這個原因呢……=And... \nthat's not the only reason...

學園祭執行委員=School Festival Committee Member
啊，找到了……！\n{{A}}，救命啊！=Ah, there you are...! \nPlease help us, {{A}}!
……怎麼了？=...What's wrong?
學園祭的交流活動……\n{{A}}和{{B}}要合演舞臺劇！？=During the school festival... {{A}} and {{B}} will be doing a joint play!?
可是，\n我們學校根本沒有戲劇部啊！=But there's no drama club at our school!
就是說啊！但這是之前……\n{{B}}和{{A}}擅自定的！=That's true! But this was something... {{B}} and {{A}} decided on their own!
說什麼，{{A}}有學生是專業的舞臺演員，\n還有職業漫畫家……=Apparently, there's a professional stage actor and professional manga artist from {{A}}...
{{A}}他們好像是想靠那兩個學生，\n給學園祭拉觀眾呢！=It seems that the teachers were trying to attract visitors to the school festival by inviting the two of them!
所以就說要合演舞臺劇對吧。\n該說他們欠考慮呢，還是目光短淺呢……=So that's why they suggested a joint stage play. Can't tell if they were being thoughtless or just short-sighted...
然後呢？現在兩位{{A}}都不在了，\n才發現有這件事？=Now that both Yamanashi-sensei and Akashi-sensei are gone, this has come to light?
對啊！而且{{A}}的戲劇部好像還很上心，\n我們怎麼辦才好啊……！=That's right! And apparently {{A}}'s drama club is really into it, what should we do...! 

然後……{{A}}，\n你不會說了「我來想想辦法」之類的話吧？=So... Don't tell me {{A}} said something like "I'll handle it"?
說了……=Said it...
因為他們看上去很慘啊。\n本來這個時候最忙的就是執行委員。=They just looked so miserable. And this is supposed to be the busiest time for committee members.
而且我一聽說是那兩個人留下的爛攤子，\n就更不能置之不理了。=And when I heard it was a mess left behind by those two, I couldn't just leave it alone.
哎～=Ahh～
{{A}}太好心了={{A}} is too kind
你又在勉強自己了=<size\=25>You're pushing yourself again</size>

Choice 1
對啊……我們只是擔心，\n{{A}}又要操心這操心那了……=Yeah… We're just worried {{A}} is gonna take everything on herself again...
這倒是不會。\n畢竟{{A}}所謂的工作改革已經廢除了……=That's fine. {{A}}'s so-called work reform was abolished the other day...
Choice 2
謝謝，我沒事的。\n畢竟{{A}}所謂的工作改革已經廢除了……=Thanks you, I'm fine. {{A}}'s so-called work reform was abolished the other day...

{{A}}也恢復了工作，\n她會牽頭讓其他{{B}}幫我的。=The teachers, including the returned {{A}}, are all helping me.
要是{{A}}能忙得過來倒也沒什麼。\n那個{{B}}還真是丟下個爛攤子啊……=If {{A}} can handle it, then that's fine. That {{B}} really left a mess...
{{A}}是已經向警察自首，\n現在被停職處分了吧？={{A}} turned himself in to the police and is now on leave, right?
是的，到現在也沒確定返校日期。\n感覺他更有可能會被直接辭退吧。=Yes, and there's still no set date for his return. There's a good chance he'll just be dismissed entirely.
我暫且從{{A}}的電腦裡，\n確認了這次活動的策劃案……=I checked the project proposal on {{A}}'s computer...
原計劃是以{{A}}為主力，\n讓各個委員會的學生都參與演出。=Originally, the {{A}}s were the lead, with students from all committees also participating.
打算趕鴨子上架演戲啊……\n這也太隨便了……=They seriously planned to throw together a play with this ragtag group... This goes beyond bad planning...
而且說什麼以{{B}}為主力，\n顯然是打算都扔給{{A}}啊……=And what's with the {{B}}s as the lead, it's obvious they were trying to dump it all on {{A}}...
那要按照{{A}}的安排，\n讓{{B}}去演戲嗎？=So should we follow {{A}}'s plan and let the {{B}}s act?
那是真不行啦。\n而且其他委員在活動期間也都很忙的。=That's obviously not possible. All the other members are very busy during the school festival.
那怎麼辦啊？=Then what should we do?
道個歉拒絕？=Apologize and decline?
招募其他有志之士？=<size\=29>Recruit willing volunteers?</size>
不會讓我們上吧……？=<size\=27>Surely you won't have us do it...?</size>

Choice 1
說實話，\n這才是正確的選擇……=To be honest,\nthis is the right choice...
但我想先試著招募一下有志之士呢。=But I'd like to try recruiting some willing volunteers first.
Choice 2
{{A}}，不愧是隊長。\n其實我也是這麼想的。={{A}}, as expected from leader. In fact, I was thinking of doing the same thing.
儘管我也考慮過跟{{A}}道歉，\n婉拒這次交流活動，但……=I thought about apologizing to {{A}} and refusing the offer...
Choice 3
{{A}}，其實我也想過這樣，\n不過我打算先招募一下有志之士。={{A}}, I thought about that too, but I'd like to try recruiting some willing volunteers first.

雖說這是{{A}}擅自定的，\n可對{{B}}來說也是學校間的約定啊。=Even if {{A}} went ahead with it on his own, for {{B}}, it's still a promise between schools.
在對方戲劇部看來，\n他們會覺得已刮的學生說話不算話。=From their drama club's perspective, it will seem like our students broke their promise.
的確……會被抱怨說：\n「明明是{{A}}來求我們的，搞什麼啊！」=Definitely... They'll complain: "You were the one who came begging us, what the heck!"
對。所以我覺得，\n比起直接放棄，不如先努力一下試試看。=Right. Rather than giving up, I thought I'd try my best.
你已經有了很不錯的慾望，{{A}}。\n吾相信你的想法會感染學生們的。=You have a very good desire, {{A}}. I'm sure your feelings will spread to the students.
謝謝。不過……\n能不能招到人，我心裡也沒底呢……=Thank you. But... I don't know if I'll be able to recruit anyone...
我會問問班裡的同學！\n對了，是不是做個海報效果更好？=I'll ask my class! Ah, maybe I should make a poster or something?
我也來幫忙，如果有需要的地方就說。\n雖然我對演戲完全是門外漢……=I'll help out too. Just let me know if there's anything I can do. I don't know much about acting though...
我也會幫忙的=I'll help too
我會為你加油的=I'll be cheering for you

Choice 1
謝謝大家。=Thank you, everyone.
Choice 2
sr:"^不是啦，別光顧著加油，\n(.*)也來幫忙啊……$"="No, don't just cheer, $1 should help too..."
{{A}}，謝謝。這畢竟是我答應的事，\n只是加油我也會很開心的。={{A}}, thank you. This is something I took on, so I'm happy just to have that sentiment.

好了，差不多下午的課也要開始了。\n我們回教室吧？=Right, afternoon classes are about to start. \nShall we head back to the classroom?

sr:"^好了，(.*)！\n我們出發吧～！$"="Okay, $1!\nLet's go～!"
去哪兒？=Where to?
那疊紙是……=<size\=30>That stack of paper is...</size>

Choice 1
當然是發傳單啦！\n幫{{A}}招募演舞臺劇的演員呀！=We're handing out flyers, of course! To help {{A}} recruit actors for the stage play!
Choice 2
都是傳單哦！\n幫{{A}}招募演舞臺劇演員的！=It's a flyer! To help {{A}} recruit actors for the stage play!

哦……！？\n你都已經做好了嗎！=Oh...!?\nYou've already made it!
那是。同伴碰到困難，哪能放著不管阿。\n俗話說「好事宜遲」嘛！=I can't just leave my friends in trouble. As the saying goes, "More haste, less speed"!
……是「好事不宜遲」啦。=...If you're going to say that, then it should be "All haste, no delay".
哦，是嗎？哎呀別在意那些細節！\n我們開始發傳單吧～Let's go！=Oh, was it? Meh, forget the details! \nAnyway, time to pass these out～ Let's go!

我們是學園祭戲劇組～\n正在招募有志人士～！=The school festival drama team is recruiting～!
無論是否對表演感興趣，\n希望大家都能踴躍參加～！=Whether you're interested in theater or not, please join us～!
和{{A}}一起發了傳單……=Handed out flyers with {{A}}...

完全招不到人啊……=Can't recruit anyone at all...
可不是嘛。就算趁放學後發傳單，\n也沒人停下來聽我們說話……=That's right. We handed out flyers after school, but no one listened...
啊，我也是。\n在班裡拉了一圈人，全滅……=Ah, me too. I tried asking the guys in my class, but it was a complete failure...
有的說社團活動太忙了，\n也有很多根本就沒想去學園祭。=Most people are either too busy with their club stuff or just skipping the festival altogether.
{{A}}，還有人不參加嗎！？={{A}}, there are people not going!?
好不容易不上課，要回家睡覺。\n好幾個人都這麼說呢。=I heard some guys say that if there's no class, they'll just sleep at home.
怎麼會……明明我都已經開始期待，\n學園祭上能吃什麼好的了！=I can't believe it... I'm already looking forward to what I'm going to eat!
……也就是說，\n有那麼多學生失去了慾望啊。=...This just goes to show that many students have lost their desires.
的確……\n感覺比起去年，學園祭的熱度降低了不少。=That's true... Compared to last year, the enthusiasm around the school festival feels way lower.
所以才招不到演出的人嗎……=So that's why we can't even recruit anyone...
當然，\n還有很多是不好意思上臺啦～=Of course. There are a lot of people who are shy to go on stage～
他們說如果「{{A}}」要來的話，\n就想去看看。但絕對不想自己上臺演。=They say if "{{A}}" is coming, they'd love to go watch. But absolutely no way they'd perform themselves. 
是哪個明星嗎？=Which celebrity is it?

Choice 1
沒錯，是在{{A}}上學的專業演員啦。\n聽說是高三學生呢。=Yes, the professional actor who goes to {{A}}... I heard he's a third-year student.
Choice 2
{{B}}，你忘了？本來這次，\n就是想靠{{A}}的專業演員拉客呢。={{B}}, did you forget? This was about attracting people by relying on that professional actor from {{A}}.
那個演員就是{{A}}。\n好像是高三學生。=That actor is {{A}}. He's a third-year student.

{{A}}……\n我沒聽說過啊。={{A}}...\nI've never heard of them.
他似乎沒怎麼上過電視，\n是以演舞臺劇為主的。=It seems he doesn't appear on TV much. he mainly appears in stage play.
我之前也不了解，查了一下才知道，\n他好像在初高中生之間很受歡迎呢。=I didn't know much about him, but after searching, he seems quite popular, especially with high school students.
可不是嗎～\n我們班也有不少他的粉絲。=That's right～\nThere are quite a few fans in our class too.
說他的彩排影片和幕後花絮都超帥，\n安利我看了好多呢。=They showed me tons of his rehearsal clips and behind-the-scenes footage, all super cool!
什麼啊，那讓他的那些粉絲們，\n來演這個舞臺劇不就好了嘛。=What the heck, then why don't those fans just go perform in the play themselves?
不是哦，她們說去看自己的推當然很好，\n但要跟推站在同一個舞臺上就不行。=That's a different story. They say it's fine to watch from the sidelines, but actually standing on the same stage just feels off.
啊？要是讓我跟{{A}}在同一個廚房做拉麵，\n那可是再開心不過了！=Huh? If it were me, being able to make ramen in the same kitchen as {{A}} would be the best thing ever!
拉麵跟演戲是不一樣的吧……\n原來對{{A}}來說，{{B}}是「推」啊……=Ramen and acting are two different things... Also, {{B}} is {{A}}'s "favorite"...
{{B}}……\n跟{{A}}碰面的日子快到了，真傷腦筋啊。={{B}}... The day we meet with {{A}} is coming up soon, this is such a headache.
如果再招不到人的話……\n{{A}}，能麻煩你來演嗎？=If we really can't recruit anyone... \n{{A}}, could I ask you to act?
{{A}}？\n真的要讓我演嗎！？=Eh?\nYou seriously want me to act!?
很合適啊=Perfect fit
我一定會去捧場的=<size\=30>I'll come to support you</size>
有點擔心……=A bit worried...

Choice 1
嗯，論演技的話{{A}}肯定沒問題，\n畢竟連{{B}}也能騙過。=Yes, {{A}}'s acting skills are second to none.\nShe even managed to fool {{B}}.
{{A}}～可是，\n在舞臺上演戲是另一回事吧！？={{A}}～ \nBut being on stage is a whole other story!?
Choice 2
等等等等，\n我們能不能別站著說話不腰疼？=No no no, can we not just stand here acting like it's so easy?
Choice 3
對吧對吧！？\n我肯定不行的啦，{{A}}！=R-Right!?\nI can't do it, {{A}}!
不，我覺得{{A}}你很合適啊。\n騙{{B}}那時候，你的演技可精湛了。=No, I think it fits {{A}}. Your acting skills when fooling {{B}} were also impressive.
不，可是，\n我當時好多話都是真心話來著……=No, but at that time my true feelings were mixed in...

{{A}}……拜託你了！={{A}}... Please!
{{B}}，被{{A}}這麼一求，\n讓我怎麼忍心拒絕……！={{B}}, when you ask me like that, {{A}}, how can I possibly say no...!
{{A}}，那行吧……\n如果完全招不到人的話……我就上？={{A}}, fine then... \nIf we can't recruit anyone... I'll do it?
謝謝你，{{A}}！=Thank you, {{A}}!
{{A}}，一定要招到人啊……！={{A}}, I hope someone will volunteer...!

追星族女孩=Celebrity Fangirl
呐，剛才朋友發訊息說，\n{{A}}現在就在我們學校哦！=Hey, my friend just messaged me,\n{{A}} is in our school right now!
{{A}}女粉絲={{A}} Fangirl
真假！？什麼情況！？他在哪兒！？=For real!? What's going on!? Where is he!?
我也不知道啦！你看，還有照片！\n他在{{A}}的走廊上呢！=I don't know either! Look, there's even a photo! He's in the hallway of {{A}}!
{{A}}，真的！\n我們走！快去找找他！={{A}}, really!\nLet's go! We have to hurry!
sr:"^(.*)，我們走吧！\n聽說集合地點是<color\=#ff0000>接待室</color>。$"="$1, let's go! I heard the meeting place is the <color\=#ff0000>reception room</color>."
你忘啦？\n就是跟{{A}}戲劇部的第一次碰頭啦。=Did you forget? \nIt's our first meeting with {{A}}'s drama club.
我們雖然只是幫忙的，\n但{{A}}說讓我們也一起。走吧？=We're just helping out, but {{A}} asked us to listen to the discussion together. Let's go!

sr:"^啊，是(.*)，還有(.*)。\n謝謝你們能來。$"="Ah, it's $1, and $2.\nThank you for coming."
招人的事情……\n最後怎麼樣了？=So how did it go... \nwith the recruitment thing?
很遺憾，目前依然是0人。\n看來{{A}}和我參演，已經板上釘釘了……=Unfortunately, still zero people.\nLooks like {{A}} and I will be performing...
真的嗎……也就是說，\n{{B}}這邊只有{{C}}跟{{A}}出場嗎？=For real... So that means, the only people doing the play on {{B}}'s side are {{C}} and {{A}}.
是啊。結果就我們倆參加，\n還是會讓{{A}}對我們印象很差吧。=Yes. With just the two of us participating, I'm afraid we'll leave a terrible impression on {{A}}.
如今只能告訴他們這邊的真實情況，\n好好道歉了。=I'll explain the situation properly and apologize.
如果對方不想合作，這件事就到此為止。\n如果還願意繼續合演的話……=If they refuse, then the matter is over. If they still want to do it...
那我們就加油吧，{{A}}。=Let's do our best, {{A}}.

請進。=Please come in.
請坐吧？=Please take a seat.
啊，好的……！=Ah, okay...!
各位{{A}}的同學，\n歡迎來到我們學校。=A warm welcome to the students of {{A}}.
我是負責本次兩校合演的{{A}}。\n{{B}}。=I'm in charge of the joint performance. My name is {{A}}. {{B}}.
戲劇部部長=Drama Club President
大家好，我是{{A}}戲劇部的部長。\n她是副部長。=Hello, I'm the president of the {{A}} drama club. She's the vice president.
然後，他們是……=And, they are...
{{B}}，我是{{A}}。={{B}}, I'm {{A}}.
我是{{A}}……{{B}}。=I'm {{A}}... {{B}}.
{{A}}的話……想必大家都認識他了。\n{{B}}，她是漫畫家「{{C}}」。=You probably know {{A}}, right? \n{{B}} is the manga artist "{{C}}".
{{A}}是！？「{{C}}」的！？\n{{B}}～～～～！？={{A}}!? "{{C}}"!?\n{{B}}～～～～!?
……誰？=...Who?

Choice 1
哎呀，我前陣子不是說過嘛？\n就是「{{A}}」的作者啦！=Oh come on, didn't I just tell you the other day? She's the author of "{{A}}"!
我超級愛看！人氣超高！\n她就是畫那個漫畫的人！=I love that series! It's super popular! \nShe's the one who draws it!
Choice 2
那什麼，我之前不是告訴過你了嘛？\n是我正在追的一個超人氣漫畫！=What? Didn't I just tell you the other day? It's the super popular manga I'm following!
{{A}}就是它的作者啦！={{A}} is the author!

{{C}}……雖然我知道{{A}}是高中生，\n但沒想到就是{{B}}的學生呀～={{C}}... I knew {{A}} was a high school student, but I didn't expect her to be a student at {{B}}～
事到如今怎麼還一驚一乍……\n不是你們非要{{A}}和{{B}}來參加嗎？=Why are you still so surprised... Weren't you the ones who insisted on having {{A}} and {{B}} to join?
不就是為了把高中生演員，\n和高中生漫畫家都拉來貴校學園祭嗎？=<size\=29>You wanted to invite the high school actor and manga artist to your school festival, right?</size>
關於這件事，其實……=About this, actually...

啥！？你們學校沒有戲劇部！？\n而且現在演員也只有兩個！？=What!? Your school doesn't even have a drama club!? And now there are only two actors!?
真的很抱歉！=I am truly sorry!
是那個已經停職的{{B}}擅自決定的！\n{{A}}也是最近才知道……=The teachers on break decided this themselves. {{A}} only just found out...
那又關我們什麼事！\n搞什麼啊，當我們傻的嗎！=And what does that have to do with us! What, do you think we're stupid!
實在是非常抱歉……！=I am very sorry...!
我們把準備東京預賽的時間都空出來了，\n專門留給你們了啊！=We've cleared our entire schedule for the Tokyo competition, just for you!
要不是你們{{A}}一直死纏爛打，\n我們才不會答應呢！=We've refused many times, but your teachers insisted!
真的是十分抱歉！=I am truly sorry!
不也挺好嘛，部長。\n意思是這件事到此為止了唄？=That's fine, president. So this is the end of the matter?
啊？=Huh?
她們不想搞演出。\n我們也不想站在{{A}}的舞臺上。=They don't really want to perform, and we don't want to stand on {{A}}'s stage.
雙方利害一致，合作到此結束。\n對吧？=In that case, our interests are aligned and this is the end of the matter. Right?
……啊，確實。=...Ah, true.
而且，\n我也不想和沒幹勁的人同台演出。=Also, I don't want to be on stage with someone who isn't motivated.
對、對不起……=S-sorry...
哈！不愧是{{A}}。\n這職業意識可當真不一般。=Ha! As expected from {{A}}, you are very professional.
說的也是。對{{A}}而言，\n高中學園祭之流哪入得了您的法眼？=That's right. {{A}} would find a high school cultural festival so stupid and unbearable, wouldn't he?
喂，你那是什麼語氣啊……=Hey, what kind of tone is that...
我們也是，才不想跟在工作之餘，\n衝著打發時間來參加社團活動的人……=We're the same, we don't have time for people who just show up to kill time...
一起努力去贏「全戲」呢！=Let's work together to win the "All-Drama"!
等等。\n我對待社團活動一直都很認真的……=Hold on. \nI've always taken club activities seriously...
哈！誰知道呢！=Ha! Who knows!
……「全戲」？=..."All-Drama"?
他們在說什麼？=<size\=26>What are they talking about?</size>
就是「全國高校戲劇大賽」……\n是戲劇部的全國性賽事哦。="National High School Drama Competition"...\nA national drama club competition.
{{A}}，原來戲劇部也有這種比賽呀！={{A}}, Eh, so the drama club has competitions like that too!
這……\n你們還真是群門外漢啊。=Wow...\nYou guys are a bunch of amateurs.
這點上我同意{{A}}的意見。\n我們沒法和你們同台。=I agree with {{A}} on this one. we can't be on the same stage as you.
那這件事就當沒發生過吧。\n{{A}}，害我們白跑一趟。=Let's just pretend this never happened. {{A}}, we've come all this way for nothing.
等……等等！=W-wait!
怎麼了，{{A}}？=What's wrong, {{A}}?
請等一下。\n這……這樣我會很為難的。=Please wait. \nTh-this would put me in a really tough spot.
……阿？=...Huh?
我想看他們演「{{A}}」！=I want to see them play "{{A}}"!
等等，{{A}}，\n你這也太突然了吧？=Wait. What's wrong all of a sudden, {{A}}?
才、才不突然呢。我一走進這間屋子……\n第一眼看到他們時，我就……=N-not sudden at all... When I walked into this room... no, the instant I saw them, I...
我就來了靈感……！=I'm struck with inspiration...!
你們幾個，真的很符合{{A}}的感覺！=You guys fit the image of {{A}} perfectly!
你是……{{A}}……\n不，你是{{A}}的妹妹！=You are... The protagonist...\nNo, you are the protagonist's little sister!
你……\n沒錯，你跟{{A}}一模一樣！=You are...\nRight, you're exactly like the protagonist!
我、我當{{A}}！？=I-I'm the protagonist!?
而你……\n特別適合演{{A}}的哥哥！=And you... You're perfect for playing the protagonist's older brother!
哥哥！？=Older brother!?
我不演{{A}}嗎？=<size\=24>I'm not playing the protagonist?</size>
沒錯，哥哥！=Right, older brother!
而你……你的話……你是……=And you... you are... you are...
是{{A}}他們的……媽媽！=The protagonist's... mother!
媽媽！？=Mother!?
我……要給他們提供原作。\n希望{{A}}的戲劇部也能配合他們。=I... want to provide them with an original script. I hope the {{A}} drama club will cooperate with them.
{{A}}\n不不不，為啥事情會變成這樣！={{A}} No no no, how did things end up like this!?
他們看上去沒什麼演出經驗……\n所以得好好指導一下。=Since they seem to be beginners when it comes to acting... We'll have to teach them a lot.
要是不願幫忙的話，\n以後{{A}}戲劇部就不能再用我的原作……！=If you don't cooperate, I won't let the {{A}} drama club use my original work anymore...!
啥！？=Huh!?
你們本來是打算用我的短篇，\n來當作東京預賽的作品對吧？=You were planning to use one of my short pieces for the Tokyo competition, right?
我不同意了。=I don't agree anymore.
等、等等等等！{{A}}！？\n為啥做得這麼絕！？=W-wait! {{A}}!? \nWhy are you being so extreme!?
是、是因為……靈感來了。=I-it's because... I got inspired.
……真受不了你們這些想一齣是一齣的天才！=...I can't stand you geniuses and your random whims.
啊——好吧！=Argh- fine!
{{A}}，你來指導{{B}}的人吧。={{A}}, you coach the {{B}} students.
……我？=...Me?
本來{{B}}就是衝著你跟{{A}}來的。\n我們只是配角罷了，對吧？={{B}} only needed you and {{A}}. We're just an afterthought, right?
沒、沒有，沒那回事……！=N-no, not at all...!
我們把{{A}}留給你們。{{B}}，\n反正只要有人留下教他們，你就滿意了吧？=We'll leave {{A}} to you. {{B}}, as long as someone stays to teach them, you're satisfied, right?
嗯。我只要跟他們一起……=Yes. As long as I'm with them...
能跟他們一起合作就可以。=Being able to collaborate with them is fine.
好好，那就這麼定了！\n那我們也能集中精力準備大賽了。=Okay. Then it's settled. We'll focus on practicing for the competition.
喂，等等。\n我也要參加比賽的……！=Hey, wait a minute. \nI'm in the competition too...!
……本來就沒安排你的角色哦。\n怕你到時候突然來工作，放我們鴿子呢。=...There's no role for you in the first place. We were worried you'd bail on us last minute because of work.
就這麼說定了。\n{{A}}的同學們，合演加油哦～！=Well then, students of {{A}}, good luck with the joint play～!
那、那個！十分抱歉……！\n{{A}}也不用勉強留下的……=Umm! I'm so sorry...! But {{A}}, you don't have to stay...
那可不行。如果{{A}}也走了，\n合演就辦不成了吧。=That's no good. If {{A}} also leaves, this whole deal might fall apart, right?
我……想和你們一起演出。=I... would like to perform with you.
行吧。要是你鬧彆扭不讓用原作的話，\n戲劇部那邊也不好辦。=I get it. If you get upset and we can't use the script, it'll be a problem for the drama club.
不過，既然決定要演，\n希望大家能認真對待這個舞臺。=But now that we've committed to this, I want everyone to take this stage seriously.
請放心！\n畢竟這是我們的學園祭！=Don't worry!\nIt's our school festival after all!
Bene（好的），那從明天起，\n每天放學後我都會過來。=Bene (Well), starting tomorrow, I'll stop by here after school.
我也是……\n只要沒有工作，每天都會來……！=Me too... I'll come here every day unless I have work...!
等等{{A}}！我也要演嗎？\n而且是演老媽！？=Wait a minute, {{A}}! Am I really going to be on stage too? And as a mom!
應、應該吧。說{{A}}你跟媽媽角色特別符合。\n雖然我也不懂為什麼……=Well, I'm not sure why, but it seems like {{A}} perfectly fits the image of a mother...
到底哪裡符合了啊……=What kind of image is that...
{{A}}的媽媽，\n明明是個溫柔美麗又顧家的角色。=The mother of {{A}} is a kind, beautiful, and homely character.
雖然看到後面，會發現其實實力超強。=As the story progresses, it turns out that she was actually super strong.
拉麵才能被相中了？=<size\=29>Noticed your ramen skills?</size>
{{A}}的溫柔被看穿了？=<size\=29>Saw through {{A}}'s kindness?</size>

Choice 1

Choice 2

不對！她一句話都沒跟我說過，\n怎麼可能知道我其實很溫柔！？=No! She hasn't even talked to me, there's no way she could know something like that!?

我還沒看過{{A}}呢。\n{{B}}他們一家……跟我們很像嗎？=I haven't read {{A}} yet. Are the protagonist and his family... like us?
我想想……{{A}}的故事是：\n三兄妹成了怪盜、去調查案件真相什麼的。=Let's see... the story is about three siblings who become Phantom Thieves and investigate the truth behind a certain incident.
{{A}}是活潑的女高中生，有個聰明哥哥，\n還有個弱氣但有超能力的妹妹……=The protagonist is a lively high school girl, with a smart older brother, and a timid but mysteriously powerful little sister...
{{A}}和弱氣妹妹……\n我覺得怎麼也對不上啊。={{A}} and the timid little sister...\nI just can't see the resemblance.
唔，有意思。\n也許是她身為作者獨有的看法……=Hm, that's interesting. \nMaybe it's just the author's perspective...
總之，演出都已經定了，\n我們就好好努力，別再讓{{A}}難堪吧。=Anyway, we're stuck doing the play now. so let's do our best and not disrespect {{A}}!
sr:"^(.*)跟(.*)也是，\n要一起加油哦！$"="$1 and $2 too, \nlet's work hard together!"

一定要向{{A}}問好哦～\n下次我們會帶貢品來的～=Next time we'll bring some gifts～ \nPlease say hi to Ikenami-kun for us～
不是，帶禮品不如直接來幫忙演啊……=Nah, forget the gifts and cheering, just come help us perform instead...
……哼，原來如此。=...Hmph, I see.
看來有人需要「{{A}}」的幫助呢……\n再暗中觀察一陣吧。=Looks like someone's in need of the "Chosen One's" help... I'll observe a bit more from the shadows.
辛苦了，{{A}}。\n……還有{{B}}。=Good work, {{A}}.\n...And you too, {{B}}.
外面好誇張。\n聚集了一大堆來看{{A}}的女生。=It's crazy out there. There were a lot of girls who came to see Ikenami-san.
好像是吧，承蒙大家厚愛。=It seems so, I'm grateful for it.
哈？還真官方啊。\n連說客套話也不失帥哥氣場。=Huh? The way you brush it off so smoothly, no wonder you're so cool.
最近的粉絲……\n似乎只是從那些爆紅的影片了解我。=But the recent fans... \nonly know me from that viral video.
但說真心話，\n希望他們也能看看舞臺上的我。=To be honest, I hope they can see me on the stage too.
影片？=Video?
舞臺？=Stage?
嗯，我的主戰場是在舞臺上。\n雖然都只是些小劇場公演。=Yes, my real battleground is the stage, but I only perform in small theaters.
前不久，一家雜誌社採訪過我，\n然後在SNS上發了我彩排的影片……=Not long ago, a magazine company came to interview me and posted a video of me practicing on the SNS...

我本來希望大家能多關注我的舞臺……\n不過也不能奢求吧。=I actually wanted to be noticed for my stage work... but I guess that's asking too much.

{{B}}？這算是{{A}}的最新作品吧！？\n一天時間就寫完了！？太厲害了！={{B}}? This is {{A}}'s latest work!? And you wrote it in a single day!? That's amazing!
是的，我滿腦子都是你們的樣子……\n結果一不留神，一晚上就寫完了。=Yes, I was overwhelmed with your images... Before I knew it, I had written it all in one night.
不過，只有5個演員還是不太夠。\n還有很多其他角色沒人演……=But no matter what, five people just aren't enough. We've still got several roles left uncast...
也對，不止是主角團，\n還需要有人演敵對方才行。=That's true, besides the main cast, we need people to play the antagonists too.
嗯……我應該可以分飾多角。\n不過就算這樣，也至少還缺1到2人。=Hmm... I could probably take on multiple roles. But even then, we're still short by at least one or two people.
而且還需要工作人員。\n音效、燈光，總不能讓演員自己來。=You also need staff. Sound and lighting have to be separate from the actors.
對哦，幕後的工作人員……\n要不然我問問其他{{A}}們？=Oh right, backstage staff... How about I ask some of the other {{A}}s?
嗯，拜託了。\n那我們就先以目前的演員開始排練吧？=Yeah, I'd appreciate that. Let's begin rehearsing with the current cast?

Choice 2
是啊，這麼厲害的演技，\n我們根本學不來吧……=Yeah, with acting that good, I don't think it's possible to imitate it...
不對，我做拉麵也是看著師父學會的！\n所以只有多試試才知道行不行吧？=For ramen, I learned the techniques from my master by watching him, guess you learn everything by practicing?

沒錯，只有自己多念臺詞，身體力行……=Exactly. You have to keep practicing your lines, put it into action...
在心裡慢慢深化對角色的解讀，\n才能真正演好這個「人」。=Only by deeply understanding the character can you truly become "them" on stage.
一開始演不好沒關係，\n我們繼續對臺詞吧。=It's okay to be bad at first. \nLet's continue the table read.

好了，天也快要黑了，\n今天就到這裡吧。=Alright, it's getting dark, let's stop here for today.
{{A}}～有點累……\n不過都是很新奇的體驗，開心！={{A}}～ I'm a bit tired... but it was all such a new experience, I'm happy!
那就好。\n表演，讓自己開心才最重要嘛。=That's the most important thing. Acting is about having fun.
那明天也同一時間，如何？=So, same time tomorrow, how about it?

是嗎？\n那那～我可以叫你{{A}}嗎？=Really? Then～ can I just call you {{A}}?

{{B}}！Bravo！！\n你這不是挺有表演天賦的嘛，{{A}}！={{B}}! Bravo!! \nYou have a real talent for acting, {{A}}!
{{A}}，好像變了個人似的……={{A}}, feels completely different...
啊，抱歉……\n{{A}}，一放鬆下來，不小心就這樣了。=Ah, sorry... {{A}}, I'm just relived, that's all.
看來，\n我們把你從那裡帶出來是對的呢。=It seems that it was the right decision to get you out of there.
畢竟對方好像和你有工作往來，\n我們還在猶豫要不要這麼做呢。=After all, she seemed like someone you knew from work, so we were a little hesitant.
{{A}}，幸好你們替我解圍，幫大忙了。={{A}}, you helped me out, thank you.
那人是個雜誌主編。\n不知為何似乎很支持我。=That person is a magazine editor-in-chief. For some reason, she seems to really support me.
她能寫我的報導，我自然很感激。\n但約我吃飯什麼的就……=I appreciate her writing articles about me. But I don't like being invited to dinner...
{{A}}～原來如此……={{A}}～ I see...
{{A}}……\n果然娛樂圈的人際關係很難處理啊……={{A}}... Being a celebrity is hard...
對。\n而且她的雜誌很有影響力，不敢得罪她啊。=Right. And her magazine is very influential, \nI dare not offend her.
我之前不是說，\n我是因為排練的影片才爆紅的嗎？=I said before, I went viral because of the rehearsal video, right?
上傳那個影片的，就是她。\n之後還很周到地立刻讓我上了雜誌。=She was the one who posted it. And she was kind enough to feature me in a magazine afterwards.
原來是她的功勞=It's all thanks to her
是你的伯樂啊=She saw your potential
嗯……可以這麼說。=Yes... You can say that.
但我並不想以這種方式出名，\n所以心情很複雜。=I wasn't exactly thrilled with how this fame came about, so it's complicated.
不過從那之後，就來了很多電視臺的機會，\n也算好事吧。=But after that, I started getting way more opportunities from the TV station. Guess it worked out in the end.
哇，這不是很厲害嘛！=Wow, isn't that amazing!
但是……說實在的，\n我本打算今年不接戲了。=But... to be honest, I was planning to cut back on acting jobs this year.
{{A}}？為什麼？={{A}}? Why?
畢竟是高中最後一年了……\n我想把精力都放在戲劇部的全戲上。=Since it's my final year in high school... I wanted to focus everything on the drama club's big show.
但我又拒絕不了{{A}}介紹的工作……\n結果給戲劇部添了很多麻煩。=I couldn't turn down {{A}}'s offer, so I ended up burdening the drama club.
所以才跟部長他們有矛盾啊？=So that's why things got awkward with the club president and the others?
他們真的都非常努力。\n所以在他們眼裡，我顯得有些飄吧。=They all work really hard. So I guess I look frivolous.
哎。比起繼續給大家添麻煩，\n還不如放棄社團，專心接工作呢……=Sigh... I should probably just quit the club and focus on work instead of being a burden.
哎呀，不小心說多了。\n抱歉啊，盡說些喪氣話。=Ah, I talked too much. \nSorry for venting like that.
總之剛才真的幫大忙了。\n謝謝大家。=Seriously, you guys saved me back there.\nThank you, everyone.
客氣啥，{{A}}！\n以後有事隨時叫我們，不用客氣。=If anything else happens, please don't hesitate to ask, {{A}}!
……那個，{{A}}，\n你從剛才起就一直在畫什麼呢？=...Hey, {{A}}, what have you been drawing?
我在畫素描。\n我覺得剛才的事很有意思，所以……=I am sketching. That commotion earlier was intriguing, so...
哇，畫得好棒……！\n不愧是{{A}}！=Wow, that's great...! \nAs expected from {{A}}!
我也畫了大家排練的樣子。=I also drew everyone rehearsing.
哇……好厲害。\n不過畫這個能派上什麼用場嗎？=Wow... that's amazing. But what use is there in drawing this?
沒什麼特別的目的……\n就只是單純想畫而已。=No particular reason...\nI just wanted to draw.
只要看到你們，我就會有很多靈感……\n所以就都畫下來了。=Just seeing you all gives me all sorts of ideas... so I've been sketching them down, that's all.
想到好點子了？=Got any good ideas?
能把我們畫進漫畫裡嗎？=Can you put us in the it?

Choice 1
嗯，是的。\n感覺對後面做分鏡也很有幫助。=Yes. Feels like this will really help with the storyboarding later too.
Choice 2
那個嘛……可能不會直接畫進去，\n但會以大家為原型改編一下。=Well... It won't be exactly like you, but there may be some scenes based on you.

{{B}}，好害羞呀，\n被{{A}}當做素材了～！={{B}}, I'm so embarrassed, {{A}} used me as a reference～!
那麼各位，剛才那位女士已經走了，\n我們也差不多回去吧。=Well everyone, that woman is gone now, it's time for us to go home.

----------
2nd Rehearsal
----------
對了，\n你們什麼時候開始做大型道具啊？=By the way, when do you guys make the big props?
……大型道具？=...Big props?
比如家庭場景的桌子椅子之類，\n感覺是必需的吧？=For example, a table set for a scene inside the house.
啊～那個啊！\n那些也得我們自己做嗎？=Ah～ Those!\nDo we have to make those ourselves?
那我們是不是還得準備服裝？=Do we need to prepare costumes as well?
還有……需要準備音響吧。=Also... we need to prepare some sounds.
還有照明設備？=And lighting?
還需要勇氣！=And courage!

Choice 1
要操心的事情好多啊……=There are so many things to worry about...
{{A}}，這些後臺的雜事也太多了吧？\n這樣還能來得及嗎……={{A}}, that's too much backstage work, right? \nWill we even make it in time...
Choice 2
的確！勇氣也很重要呢！=Of course! Courage is also important!
{{A}}……雖然但是，那什麼……\n竟然沒人負責吐槽嗎？={{A}}... Wait, seriously... Is no one going to call out how ridiculous this is?
{{A}}，這麼一盤算，雜事也太多了吧？\n還能來得及嗎……={{A}}, that's too much backstage work, right? \nWill we even make it in time...

總之，我們盤點一下都需要什麼吧。\n{{A}}，你對佈景有沒有想法？=Anyway, let's start by listing what we need. {{A}}, do you have any ideas for the set design?
我在寫劇本的時候稍微想過，\n需要安排的場景有……=Yes, actually, I've been thinking about it while writing the script. The key scenes we'll need are...
唔……原來如此。\n這樣就能控制佈景成本……=Hmm... I see. \nThis will keep the cost of the set in check...
既然是學園祭，學校應該會提供幕布吧？\n有幕布的話就可以模擬出各種情景了。=Since it's the school festival, we can borrow blackout curtains from the school, right? We could stage all kinds of scenes with those.
嗯，每個小組至少可以申請5張幕布。\n其他的就得跟執行委員爭取一下了……=Yes, each group can apply for at least 5 curtains. The rest will depend on how negotiations go with the committee members...
這件事就交給我吧。=Leave this matter to me.
真靠得住！\n那剩下的就是……=So reliable! \nThen what's left is...
Bene（好）！差不多都安排好了，\n等實際進行的時候再微調吧！=Bene (Good)! We'll tweak things as we go, \nbut the framework's there!
今天就先買零散的小道具吧！\n去{{A}}如何？=Let's buy some small props today! \nHow about going to {{A}}?
{{B}}！\n{{A}}，你今天很嗨啊！={{B}}! {{A}}, you're really excited today!
{{A}}，有嗎……？={{A}}, really...?
這不挺好的嘛？說明你很開心！\n那就一起去{{A}}吧！=Isn't that great? It means you're having fun!\nCome on, let's go to {{A}} together!

哎呀，是{{A}}！=Ara, it's {{A}}!
真巧呀！\n沒想到在這裡都能遇見{{A}}呢！=What a coincidence! \nWho would've thought I'd meet {{A}} here!
{{A}}？她不是上次那個……={{A}}? Isn't she the person from last time...
這些學生是？\n都穿著{{A}}的校服呢。=Who are these students? \nThey are all wearing {{A}} uniforms.
是學園祭演出的夥伴，\n一起來置辦道具什麼的……=We are teammates in the school festival performance, just buy props together...
哎呀，挺好的挺好的。\n這種青春時代的日常，感覺能火喲。=Ara, how lovely. \nThis fleeting youthfulness will surely trend.
請別拍照，{{A}}！\n他們只是普通的學生！=Please don't take pictures, {{A}}! They are just normal students!
沒事的呀～我會好好打碼的啦。=Don't worry～ I'll blur it properly.
抱歉，請不要拍攝本校的學生。\n也請不要拍{{A}}，他正在社團活動中。=Sorry, but please refrain from taking photos of our students. The same goes for Ikenami-kun during club activities.
……真自以為是啊。\n你以為誰喜歡拍你們呢。=...How self-important. \nAs if anyone wants to photograph you.
光站在那兒就很礙眼了，知道嗎？\n既不上鏡又不好看，啥也不是。=Your presence alone is intolerable. Must I spell out how utterly devoid of charm or worth you are?
我說你們幾個，\n別隨隨便便靠近{{A}}。=To put it bluntly, I'd appreciate it if you didn't go anywhere near {{A}}.
跟這些來歷不明的女人站一起，\n要是被八卦雜誌拍到……=What if you were caught with some random girls, the gossip magazines will have a field day...
會耽誤{{A}}的前途，懂？\n你們負得起這個責任嗎，啊？=You'd be tarnishing {{A}}'s future, do you understand? Tell me, can you even bear that responsibility?
啊？負責？=Huh? Responsibility?
總之，不許你們跟{{A}}走得太近。=Let me be clear, don't you dare act familiar with {{A}}.
這年頭，普通人也可能被網暴哦？\n你們也不想自己被網暴吧？=In this day and age, even ordinary people can fall victim to dogpiling. Surely, you wouldn't want that, would you?
那是啥，錄音筆……？\n意思是不聽你的話，我們就要被網暴？=What is that, a voice recorder...? Meaning if we don't comply, we will be dogpiled online?
喂，我說你！差不多得了！=Hey, I'm telling you! That's enough!
哎呀，我瞧瞧……=Ara, let me have a look...
雖然有些粗野，但身材、肌肉都不錯呢。\n好好打磨一下，說不定有戲哦？=A little rough around the edges, but you've got an athletic build with solid muscle definition. With some polish, you really could shine.
{{A}}！？\n你你你、你幹什麼！={{A}}!? W-what are you doing!
這邊這位也……{{A}}，臉蛋很可愛呢。\n小帥哥，娛樂圈了解一下？=And you... {{A}}, you've got such a cute face. Hey handsome, ever thought about showbiz?
別碰我=Don't touch me
{{A}}，沒興趣={{A}}, not interested
有點意思……=Interesting...
等等……！=Wait...!
秘書模樣的美青年=Young Secretary
{{A}}，他們只是普通學生。\n而且這裡人多眼雜，還請到此為……={{A}}, they are just normal students. And there are too many people here, please...
阿？？=Huh??
你在對我提意見？\n喂，你剛剛是在對我提意見嗎？？=Did you just criticize me? \nHey, are you actually criticizing me??
啊，不是……！\n但、畢竟對方是未成年，那個……=Ah, no...! \nBut, given that they're minors, umm...
{{A}}～我好不容易打算提拔你，\n來代替之前那個蠢貨的。={{A}}～ I went out of my way to promote you, replacing that worthless trash.
你明白自己的身份嗎？\n你是被我撿到的，什麼來著……=Do you even know your place? \nYou're nothing but a stray I took in...
「狗」，對吧？=A "dog", right?
我最煩咬{{A}}的狗了。懂嗎？=I can't stand dogs that bite. You know that, don't you?
失、失禮了，{{A}}……=S-sorry, {{A}}...
{{A}}。知道就行，啊。={{A}}. As long as you understand.
喂！\n你也太過分了吧！？=Hey!\nIsn't that too far!?
阿？=Huh?
沒事、沒關係的！=Fine, it's fine!
{{A}}，身為您的狗，\n我做了不該做的事，真的非常抱歉。={{A}}, though I am your dog, I have betrayed your trust. I am deeply ashamed.
等等，你難道是……？=Wait, are you...?
好好。那個，{{A}}？\n待會兒你有時間吧？=Alright. Well, {{A}}?\nDo you have time later?
機會難得，一起喝個茶怎麼樣？\n這附近有間很好的茶室哦。=Since it's such a nice occasion, shall we share some tea? I know a lovely place close by.
{{A}}，其實我……={{A}}, actually I...
不，那就陪您一起去吧……=No, I'll go with you...
抱歉，我先失陪了。\n下次再一起買東西吧。=Sorry, I have to excuse myself. \nLet's go shopping next time.
不，可是……！=No, but...!
你沒必要跟她走=You don't have to go
跟我們在一起就行=Just stay with us
沒事的……\n抱歉啊，你們先回去吧。=It's fine...\nSorry, go home for today.
……好、好吧。=...O-okay.
我們走吧，{{A}}。=Let's go, {{A}}.
{{B}}，我好開心呀，{{A}}！\n來！跟我來！={{B}}, I'm so happy, {{A}}!\nHere! Follow me!
他們走了……\n{{A}}為什麼突然……=They left... Why would {{A}}...
話說，那個叫{{A}}的是怎麼回事啊！\n怎麼那麼拽……=Also, what's wrong with that {{A}}! \nWhy is she acting all high and mighty...
但{{A}}看起來是不是有點怪？\n感覺是看到那個男人之後才答應去的……=But didn't Ikenami-kun seem off? It was like he only agreed after seeing that man...
那傢伙……被盜取了。=He's... been stolen.
不，準確說是「他們」都被盜了。=No, to be precise, "they".
吾之前沒發現{{A}}的異樣，\n但在他與那個{{B}}接觸後就很明顯了。=I couldn't read {{A}} before, but it became glaringly obvious after he interacted with {{B}}.
{{A}}，還有剛才那個男人……\n他們很有可能都被{{B}}「奪走了」慾望。={{A}}, and that man... most likely had their desires "stolen" by {{B}}.
怎麼會這樣……=How could this happen...
大家怎麼了？\n為什麼都盯著貓頭鷹看……=What's wrong, everyone? \nWhy are you all staring at the owl...
啊、沒！那個……\n因為它剛才說了……=Ah, no! Umm...\nBecause it said...
喂，{{A}}！\n{{B}}根本聽不到他的聲音吧……！=Hey, {{A}}!\n{{B}} can't him...!
啊，{{A}}～對！\n{{B}}……=Ah, ahhh～ Right!\n{{B}}...
貓頭鷹餓了……=The owl is hungry...
貓頭鷹尿了……=The owl peed...

Choice 1
{{A}}，原來透過叫聲就能明白啊。\n我待會兒要記下來……={{A}}, you can tell by the sound it makes. I'll make a note of that later...
Choice 2
尿、尿、尿了！？=P-p-peed!?
那真是……不得了啊！\n你的包沒事嗎？=That's... really bad! \nIs your bag okay?

那個……他、他還要照顧寵物，\n我們就先解散吧。=Umm... h-he still has to take care of his pet, so let's call it a day now.
也是。反正{{A}}不在，\n我們也不知道該買什麼。=Right. Anyway, since {{A}} isn't here, we don't know what to buy.
那我去一趟畫材店就回家了。\n各位再見。=Well, I'm going to stop by the art supply store and then head home. Goodbye, everyone.
sr:"^(.*)……好險啊……\n抱歉(.*)，多虧你反應快……$"="$1... That was close... Sorry $2, thanks for the quick response..."
要是你說漏嘴了，\n我們會被當成怪胎的……=If you slip up, we'll be be treated as weirdos...
對了，{{A}}，\n你剛才說{{B}}被偷走慾望的事……=Right, {{A}}, you mentioned that {{B}}'s desires were stolen...
稍等，{{A}}，這裡人太多了。\n而且話題還關乎幕後黑手……=Wait, {{A}}, let's not talk about it in such a crowded place. This is about the mastermind...
啊，說的也是。=Ah, that's true.
明天午休的時候再細聊吧，{{A}}。=Let's talk more about this during lunch break tomorrow, {{A}}.
嗯，吾知道了。\n明天在基地集合吧。=Yes, I understand. \nLet's meet at the hideout tomorrow.

----------
Day After Meeting Daichi
----------
{{A}}，關於昨天你說的……=So, {{A}}, about what you said yesterday...
{{A}}是被偷走了慾望嗎？\n被那個……叫{{B}}的人？=Has {{A}}'s desires had his stolen? By that... {{B}} woman?
唔，沒錯。=Yes, correct.
前些天，那個女人在校門口跟他糾纏時，\n吾就有些在意了……=The other day, when that woman and him were arguing, I felt uneasy...
然後透過昨天的事，吾確信了，\n{{A}}是被奪走了慾望。=After yesterday's incident, I'm convinced that {{A}} has his desires stolen.
還有昨天{{A}}帶著的那個男人也是。=The same goes for the man {{A}} was with yesterday.
那個男人也是！？=That man too!?
說起來昨天那個男人……\n跟之前在校門口見到的不是一個人吧。=By the way, the man we saw yesterday... was different from the one we saw at the school gate before.
嗯！確實不是同一個。\n難道她每天都換秘書嗎……？=Yes! It's definitely not the same. Does she change her secretary every day...?
還說了傷人的話=Even said harsh words
還叫他是狗呢=Even called him a dog

對，不光說他是「狗」，態度還很粗暴。\n與其說是秘書……=Right, not only did she call him a "dog", but she was also really harsh with him. He's less like a secretary...
不如說是「服侍」她的人。=And more like someone "serving" her.
太過分了……那這樣說的話，\n再之前的那個男人也被奪走了慾望……？=That's just too far... If that's the case, does that mean the previous man's desires were also stolen...?
唔，有可能。=Hmm, it's possible.
為什麼他們要忍下去啊？\n都那樣了，還不如直接辭職好了！=Why would they put up with it? At that point, they might as well just quit!
我想起來了，\n她好像說過「撿到你」之類的話吧。=Come to think of it, she say something like "I took you in".
也許，是被她抓住了什麼把柄呢……=Maybe she's got some kind of leverage over them...
不管怎麼說，\n那個叫{{A}}的就是下一個{{B}}吧？=Either way, that {{A}} woman must be the next {{B}}, right?
唔，可能性很高，\n因為吾都能直接感受到慾望的榨取了。=Hmm, it's highly likely, I can practically feel the draining of desires myself.
有必要去{{B}}確認一下。\n如果能知道{{A}}的全名……=We should check {{B}} to confirm. If we can find out {{A}}'s full name...
{{A}}說過她是雜誌社的編輯吧。\n網上搜搜看。={{A}} mentioned she's a magazine editor. Let's search online.
找到了……「{{A}}」。\n上面說是「週刊BAKURO」的主編。=Found her... "{{A}}". It says she's the editor-in-chief of "Weekly BAKURO".
BAKURO好像是那個，\n經常曝光藝人醜聞的雜誌吧？=Isn't BAKURO that magazine that's always exposing celebrity scandals?
對，是「{{A}}」出版的所謂爆料雜誌。=Yes, it's a gossip magazine published by "{{A}}".
上面有她的照片，肯定沒錯了。\n她本人似乎也很有名呢。=There's a photo of his face, so there's no doubt about it. She seems to be quite famous.
很有名？=Famous?
她是個精明的主編，似乎手握很多猛料。\n採訪她本人的文章點擊率也很高。=She's a talented editor-in-chief with many high-profile scoops. Articles featuring her interviews get a lot of clicks too.
不過……也有很多譴責她的聲音。\n比如，經常有被她爆料的人起訴她。=But... she also gets a lot of backlash. For example, people she's exposed often sue her.
被起訴？說她虛假報導嗎？=Sued? So her articles were fake?
嗯……\n但暫時沒搜到她輸官司的文章……=Yes... But I'm not finding any articles about her losing a case yet...
畢竟{{A}}是家大型出版社，\n他們應該有很優秀的律師吧。={{A}} is a major publisher. They probably have really good lawyers.
即使文章有不實內容，\n也很難在訴訟上贏過她吧。=Even if her articles are outright false, winning a lawsuit against her might be tough.
聽起來感覺很可怕啊……\n好像有很多內幕。=Sounds pretty sketchy... Feels like there is something shady going on.
如果只是寫文章，也構不成犯罪吧……\n啊，她有沒有被當成{{A}}投過稿？=Just writing articles isn't a crime... Ah, has anyone ever posted her as a {{A}}?
我也這麼想……=I was thinking the same thing...
{{A}}的導航頁上有她的名字，\n好像確實被投過。=Her name shows up on {{A}}, so someone must've posted.
但是……似乎沒有被官方認證過，\n那個投稿也已經刪了，看不到了。=But... it doesn't seem to be officially certified, and that post has already been deleted, so we can't see it.
被刪了……？=Deleted...?
難道，是{{A}}為了遮醜讓刪除的……？=Maybe {{A}} had it deleted as a cover-up...?
{{A}}，評論區裡也都這麼想呢。={{A}}, the comments section seems to think so too.
有人說是迫於{{A}}的壓力被刪了……=Some say it was removed due to pressure from {{A}}...
還有人說「{{A}}不可能向媒體妥協，\n不過是投稿者害怕了所以自己刪了」。=Others claim "{{A}} would never bend to the media, the poster got scared and deleted it themselves".
……不管怎樣，\n看來她是個爭議不斷的人物啊。=...Either way, she's clearly the kind of person constantly shrouded in shady rumors.
{{B}}？\n{{A}}，大家快看這個報導！={{B}}? Hey everyone, look at this article!
好像是{{B}}寫的……\n關於{{A}}的文章吧？=It's written by {{B}}... about {{A}}, right?
真是他……\n雖然照片上的眼睛打碼了，但確實是{{A}}！=It's really him... Even with the eyes blurred in the photo, it's clearly {{A}}!
這篇報導真讓人不舒服……=This article is seriously unsettling...
雖然前面是案件概要和{{A}}過往的劣跡，\n但……=It starts with a case summary and {{A}}'s past misdeeds, but...
是的，後面就慢慢變成了……=Yes, then it gradually shifts into...
「被未婚妻拋棄後A開始發瘋，自暴自棄」\n之類……="After Being Abandoned by His Fiancée, A Spiraled Into Madness and Self-Destruction"...
還有什麼「A的詐騙手段前十名」……="A's Top 10 Scam Techniques"...
把報導故意寫得很吸引眼球……\n但{{A}}也是殺人事件的被害者吧……=It feels like they're making it into a joke... But {{A}} was still a victim in that murder case...
而且，她還對{{A}}迫害過的人們，\n做了追蹤調查……=Also, it seems she is investigating what happened to {{A}}'s victims...
「性騷擾部長的悲慘結局」什麼的，\n這哪是對受害者的寫法啊……=Like "The Tragic Downfall of The Harassed Department Manager", since when is this how you write about victims...
……嗯？大家看這個！=...Huh? Everyone, look at this!
「K高中前不良{{A}}{{B}}現狀」？\n喂，這難道是……="Former Delinquent Turned {{A}} Teacher K"? Hey, isn't this...
這指的難道是……=Could it be...
對啊，這寫的不就是{{A}}嘛！=Right, isn't this about {{A}}!
{{A}}，竟然還有這種報導。\n也虧你們找得到啊。={{A}}, so this is how they're writing about it? Good job tracking this down.
這可不好笑啊，{{A}}！=This isn't funny, {{A}}!
「K以前是個不良，曾是暴走族頭子，\n現在也是校內無人敢惹的{{A}}」……="K was once a delinquent, the leader of a biker gang, and now she's a violent teacher no one can defy"...
「雖然A的懺悔使K免於處分，\n卻致使其學生們仍生活在恐懼之中」……="Though A's repentance spared K from disciplinary action, it left his students living in fear"...
這什麼報導啊，不是瞎說嗎！？\n得找誰檢舉一下吧！=Isn't this article full of lies!? We should report this to someone!
不全是瞎說哦。\n也許現在真的還有害怕我的學生呢……=It's not all lies. There may still be students who are scared of me...
而且曾是不良、受過停職處分，\n還有不准接觸學生這些也都是真的。=And it's true that I was a delinquent, was suspended, and was banned from interacting with students.
不、可是！\n那不都是{{A}}和{{B}}亂下的處分嘛！=No, but! Those were all just unfair punishments handed down by {{A}} and {{B}}!
嗯，不過……=Yes, but...
大家很害怕、沒有人敢反抗，\n這都是主觀看法吧？=The view of everyone's afraid to oppose, isn't that just a matter of perspective?
相對的，停職和禁止接觸學生的處分，\n則是不爭的事實。=On the other hand, the suspension and student interaction ban, those are solid facts.
這樣的話，\n即使檢舉也很難推翻這篇報導呢。=So even if we report, it'd be hard to refute the article.
的確……=Indeed...
他們會說「你實際上就是受到處分了呀」，\n然後事情就不了了之了吧。=I think they'll just say "You really did get disciplined", and that'll be the end of it."
可是！這上面還說{{A}}毆打學生，\n然後學生就得了憂鬱症什麼的，好多謠言！=But! It even says you beat up students, and gave them depression or something, there's so many lies!
……但我確實經常批評大家呢。\n還有上次把打火機當成危險物品沒收的事。=... But I do scold everyone quite often. And there was that incident where I confiscated a lighter as dangerous contraband...
雖然很難過，但也許就有人認為那是暴力，\n然後被嚇壞吧。所以不能說全都是捏造的。=It's upsetting, but maybe some really did see that as violence, and got scared. So I can't say it's a complete fabrication.
雖、雖然是這樣……\n但這種寫法，大家都會誤會的……！=E-even so... The way it's written, everyone will misunderstand...!
我們可以作證=We can vouch
我們永遠站在{{A}}這邊=<size\=30>We'll always stand by {{A}}</size>
{{A}}，謝謝。\n大家都好溫柔啊。={{A}}, thank you. \nYou are all so kind.
不過我沒事的，\n畢竟有這麼和我感同身受的學生們在呢。=But I'll be fine, after all I have students who understand me well.
而且……\n我被當做{{B}}、登上{{A}}也是事實。=And... it's true that I was labeled a {{B}} appeared on {{A}}.
還有這篇報導沒寫到的，\n我也是引起了不少其他事件的{{A}}呢。=Not to mention... the article didn't mention all the other incidents I cause as a {{A}}.
不管被怎麼潑髒水，我都要去承受。=No matter how much mud they sling at me, I'll bear it.
因為我認為，這也是贖罪的一部分……=Because I believe, this too is part of my atonement...
不過……這麼寫我就算了，\n但對{{A}}的寫法的確有些過分。=But... while they can write whatever they want about me, the way they portrayed {{A}} is too much.
不止{{A}}，\n還隨便消費那些受害者和當事人……=Not just {{A}}, they're shamelessly exploiting all the victims and people involved...
這篇報導並沒有揭開案件的真相，\n反而是對所有當事人的褻瀆。=This article doesn't reveal the truth of the case, it's an insult to all those involved.

可惡！雖然{{A}}說她不在意……\n但我不會原諒{{B}}的！=Damn! Even though {{A}} says she doesn't care... I'll never forgive {{B}}!
暴走族頭子、用恐懼支配學生什麼的……\n寫得太過分了！=What biker gang leader and ruling students through fear... That's too far!
不過，{{A}}的話也可以理解……\n確實還有一些學生感到害怕吧……=But, I can see why {{A}} would say that... There are still students who fear her...
這……也只有遲到或者上課打盹的時候，\n才會害怕她吧！=I mean... the only times she scares me are when I'm late or caught napping in class!
你是慣犯啊？=<size\=28>You're a repeat offender?</size>
原來你嚇得發抖啊……=So you trembled in fear...
也、也就只是高一的時候啦！\n現在上{{A}}的課，我可不敢睡！=Th-that was just in my first year! I'm scared and definitely won't sleep in {{A}}'s class now!
{{A}}，你這不還是害怕嗎。={{A}}, so you are scared after all.
嗯……\n雖然報導裡有客觀事實……=Hmm... While there are some factual elements in the report...
但絕大部分都是誇大其詞。\n真實的部分最多占3成吧。=Most of it is wildly exaggerated. I think only about 30% of it is true.
對吧？這簡直無法原諒！=Right? This is absolutely unforgivable!
如果這是{{A}}的慣用做法，\n那之前她報導過的其他醜聞恐怕也……=If this is {{A}}'s usual approach, then all those other scandals she's reported...
基本都是誇大其詞？= Mostly exaggerated?
全部都是捏造？=Completely fabricated?
是基於事實的？=Based on truth?

Choice 1
沒錯，我覺得有可能。=You're right, I think it's possible.
Choice 2
也不能說全是謠言，\n畢竟沒有確切的消息來源也寫不出報導。=We can't say it's all lies either, they must have some source to even write these reports.
只是就像之前說的……\n會刻意地誇大事實，寫成大醜聞。=But like we said earlier... they deliberately exaggerate minor things into huge scandals.
Choice 3
為什麼會如此推論呢。\n反了啦，反了。=Why would you think that. You have it backwards, backwards.
我的意思是，\n有些小事會被刻意地渲染成大醜聞。=I mean they take trivial matters and turn them into huge scandals.
{{A}}！怎麼能那樣！={{A}}! How could that be!
對那些被爆料的人，\n今後的人生該怎麼辦啊！？=What about the lives of the people they expose!?
所以她才被起訴的吧？\n啊，不過她也沒輸過啊……=That's why she gets sued, right? Ah, but she's never lost a case...
{{A}}？等等？那種無良雜誌社，\n出現這種問題不應該馬上倒閉嗎？={{A}}? Wait? How is a scummy magazine like this not bankrupt after all this backlash?
……剛才{{A}}不也說過了嘛？=...Didn't {{A}} just explain?
報導裡有「證據」也有「事實」。=Their reports always mix "evidence" and "facts".
而「捏造」的部分，\n都是些很難被證明的主觀敘述。=As for the "fabricated" parts, most are all subjective impressions or emotional claims.
所以，沒法說它完全是「謠言」。\n就算在法庭上，也是很難被抓住漏洞的。=So you can't call it pure "libel". Even in court, their wording slips through loopholes.
而且吾記得，無論金錢還是時間，\n打官司對原告的負擔都很大吧？=As I recall, lawsuits demand enormous time and money from plaintiffs, right?
如果沒有絕對的勝算……\n應該很多人都堅持不到最後吧……=Without guaranteed victory... most people just give up halfway through...
此外，在漫長的官司結束後，\n公眾早就把這件事忘得一乾二淨了。=Moreover, by the time the long trial is over, the public has completely forgotten about it.
除非是特別重大的事件，\n否則就算輸了也不會損害雜誌的形象。=Unless it's a massive case, losing won't even tarnish the magazine's reputation.
而且，即使真的輸掉了一些官司……=And, even if they lose some cases...
如果雜誌的銷量因此變高，\n那對公司非但沒有損失，反而算盈利了。=If it boosts their sales, the company profits anyway.
所以才寫些假報導？=<size\=29>So they keep writing lies?</size>
一切都是為了利益嗎……=Is all this just for profit...
嗯……\n這種做法好過分啊……=Yes... That's terrible...
也就是說只要雜誌賣得好，\n他們才不管是不是會毀了別人的生活！=So as long as the magazine sells, they couldn't care less about ruining lives!
普通雜誌倒不會做到這個地步……\n但實際上，大眾就是喜歡看這些吧。=Normal magazines wouldn't stoop this low... But in reality, the public devours these kinds of articles.
現在BAKURO這本雜誌這麼火，\n而{{A}}又是雜誌主編……=Look how popular BAKURO is now, with {{A}} as its editor-in-chief...
證明她的這套方式，\n在口碑和收益上都「成功」了……=It just goes to show her methods are a "success", both in public perception and profitability...
所以，這麼一來……=So, by that logic...
只要那傢伙想，\n就能輕易毀掉一個人，不是嗎？=If she wanted to, she could ruin anyone, right?
{{A}}……什麼意思！？={{A}}... What do you mean!?
你是說，\n她不是為了雜誌銷量而誣陷別人……=You're saying, instead of framing people in for the sake of magazine sales...
而是因為「想誣陷別人」，\n才「利用雜誌」的……對嗎？=She is "using the magazine" because she "wanted to frame people"...?
沒錯。=Exactly.
只要{{A}}能找到證據，\n哪怕對方只是犯了點小錯……=Even if it was just a small mistake, as long as {{A}} has the evidence...
她都可以用這種真假參半的文章，\n陷害並毀掉自己不喜歡、或妨礙她的人。=She can spin half-truths into articles to destroy anyone in her way, whether she dislikes them or finds them inconvenient.
原來如此……對方只能眼看報導被瘋傳、\n被全體公眾抨擊，甚至毀掉人生……=I see... Once the article gets out, they face public backlash, their life completely ruined...
然後其他忌憚{{A}}影響力的人，\n就再也不敢反抗她了……！=And from then on, no one who knows her influence would dare cross {{A}}...!
怎麼會這樣……那就是說……=What... That means...
必須立刻{{A}}=<size\=28>Have to {{A}}</size>
嗯，沒錯！=Yes, that's right!
{{A}}和那個像秘書的男的……\n一定也是這樣被奪走慾望的吧……！={{A}} and that male secretary... Their desires were definitely stolen the same way...!
唔，本打算學園祭結束前先沉澱幾天，\n看來現在已經迫在眉睫了。=Hm. I'd planned to take a break until the school festival, but we can't afford to wait now.
今天放學後就去{{A}}吧，隊長！=Let's go to {{A}} right after school, leader!

今天的排練\n能取消嗎=Can we cancel today's rehearsal?
抱歉！\n明天有小考\n不複習就完了！=Sorry! There's a quiz tomorrow, I'm dead if I don't study!
我知道啦\n加油複習吧=I see. Good luck studying.
好的\n那明天再排練吧=Okay, Then we'll rehearse tomorrow.
{{A}}跟{{B}}都回消息了。\n看來他們都同意了呢。={{A}} and {{B}} both replied. They said they agreed.
那我們就出發吧。=Let's go then.

Chapter 4 Metaverse Start
----------
接下來新區域應該會開放。\n先朝著最深處出發吧，隊長。=A new area should unlock ahead. Let's head to the deepest part, leader.
已確認新增區域。\n導航資訊更新中。=New areas have been confirmed.\nNavigation information is being updated.
大家準備好了嗎？\n朝下一個區域出發吧。=Ok, are you ready? \nLet's head to the next area.
那麼，開始吧。=So, let's get started.
原來如此……這樣聆聽{{A}}的心之聲，\n然後就能找到{{B}}啊。=I see... So this is how you listen to {{A}}' inner voice and pinpoint the {{B}}.
啊，是哦，WIND還是第一次見吧！=Ah, right, it's Wind's first time seeing this!
只要CATTLE知道那傢伙的真名，\n就能找到{{A}}了。=Once Cattle gets their full name, we can track down the {{A}}.
啊，沒什麼。=Ah, it's nothing.
我在想，現在很多人都用筆名或網名吧？\n如果找不出{{A}}的全名……=I was thinking, nowadays, there are a lot of pen names or online aliases, right? If we can't find the {{A}}'s full name...
那我們豈不是一直都找不到{{A}}？=Does that mean we'll never locate their {{A}}?
啊，那倒……也是呢。\n就像{{A}}用「{{B}}」當筆名一樣？=Ah... now that you mention it. It's like how {{A}} uses "{{B}}" as a pen name?
……找到了。\n在這個區域，的確有{{A}}。=...Found it. It seems that {{A}} is definitely in this area.
哦，真的嗎！\n果然{{A}}是{{B}}啊！=Oh, really?! So {{A}} really is a {{B}}!
也沒有像{{B}}和{{A}}那樣的不協調感。\n應該就是{{C}}沒錯了。=And unlike {{B}} and {{A}}, there's no sense of distortion here. This has to be {{C}}.
太好了！這次很順利就找到了呢！=That's great! This time we found it easily!
這也意味著有不少人被那傢伙剝奪了慾望。\n就像{{A}}一樣。=This just proves how many people have had their desires stolen by that bastard. Just like {{A}}.
奪回{{A}}的慾望吧=<size\=22>Let's take back {{A}}'s desires</size>
讓{{A}}吧=<size\=23>Let's {{A}}</size>
是啊，趁{{A}}的慾望消失之前……\n讓{{B}}吧。=Yes, before {{A}}'s desires disappear completely... Let's change Shimotsuna's heart.

Chapter 4 Palace Start
----------
這是哪裡？這次的{{A}}在森林裡嗎？=Where is this? Is the {{A}} in a forest this time?
有點嚇人呢……\n看起來像那種女巫居住的森林……=It's a bit creepy... This looks like a forest where witches live...
哈，大魔女{{A}}？\n一點都不好笑。=Huh, The Great Witch {{A}}? \nThat's not funny.
{{A}}的氣息還有段距離。\n先向森林深處前進吧。=The {{A}}'s presence is very far. Let's head deeper into the forest.
說是女巫森林可能也沒錯。\n你們看那邊。=Maybe it's not wrong to call this the witch's forest. Look.
那是什麼！？好巨大的建築！=What is that!? There's a huge building!
大樓……？=Building...?
塔……？=Tower...?

Choice 1
比起大樓……從裝飾上看更像一座塔呢。\n看起來相當高。=Rather than a building... the exterior looks more like a tower. It seems very tall.
Choice 2
是啊，看起來相當高。\n一座矗立在森林中的塔……？=Yes, it seems very tall. A tower standing in the middle of the forest...?

她應該認為自己的城堡是一座「塔」吧。\n儘管很難推測這究竟出於何種思想……=She must see her castle a "tower". Though it's hard to image why...
{{A}}的氣息就在那座塔的方向。\n而且，位置相當高。=The presence of the {{A}} is is coming from that tower. And it's located pretty high up.
原來如此，那就是在塔上吧。\n有意思。=I see, that must be at the top. \nInteresting.
{{A}}一定也在裡面。\n前進的時候保持警惕吧。={{A}} is definitely in there too. Let's stay alert as we move forward.

{{A}}……\n靠近了一看，有點壯觀啊……={{A}}...\nIt's amazing to see it up close...
又誇張又惡俗……\n我的眼都要被閃瞎了。=Gaudy and tacky... it's practically blinding.
這也不是出版社的樣子吧……\n但挺符合對她本人的印象的。=Doesn't look like a publishing house either... but it fits her image perfectly.
好了，我們趕緊進去吧……=Alright, let's hurry inside...
那裡看起來像是入口，\n但聚集了很多陰影啊。=That looks like the entrance, \nbut Shadows are gathering there.
看起來他們好像吵起來了。\n我們先躲起來看看情況。=Seems like they're arguing. Let's hide and observe for now.
雄性工蟻陰影=Male Worker Ant Shadow
拜託了！這篇報導如果今天還過不了，\n我就又得住公司了！=Please! If this article doesn't get approved today, I'll have to sleep at the office again!
雌性工蟻陰影=Female Worker Ant Shadow
請讓我見見{{A}}吧～！=Please let me see {{A}}～!
警衛螞蟻陰影=Guardian Ant Shadow
{{A}}可是很忙的！\n沒時間管你們這些平民的事情！={{A}} is busy! She has no time for commoners like you!
態度{{A}}的螞蟻陰影=Prideful Ant Shadow
如果想見到{{A}}的話，\n那就變成帥哥後再來吧！=If you want an audience with her, come back when you're handsome!
{{B}}～抱歉我不是帥哥！\n但沒有{{A}}，工作就推不下去啦！={{B}}～ Sorry I'm not handsome! But without {{A}}, I can't continue my work!
怎樣才能成為，\n被{{A}}記住的員工呢……？=What does it take to become an employee {{A}} actually remembers...
……他們在幹什麼啊。=...What are they doing.
不清楚……反正那些像螞蟻的陰影，\n好像把入口都給堵住了。=Not sure... But the entrance is blocked by those ant-like Shadows.
要不要直接打進去？=Should we just bust in?
不想打草驚蛇=<size\=30>Don't want to alert them</size>
打倒他們吧=Let's beat them

Choice 1
唔，吾等可是怪盜。\n為了安全偷到{{A}}，還是別太顯眼為好。=Hm, we are Phantom Thieves after all. Best not be too conspicuous in order to steal the {{A}} safely.
沒錯。如果引起騷動的話，\n容易被{{A}}察覺到。=Yes, if we make a scene here, {{A}} might notice.
而且也還不明白{{A}}內部的構造，\n所以還是儘量秘密潛入吧。=We don't know the {{A}}'s interior structure, let's infiltrate as stealthily as possible.

Choice 2
等等，在這裡引起騷動的話，\n很可能被{{A}}察覺的。=Wait, if we make a scene here, {{A}} might notice.
而且吾等可是怪盜。\n為了安全偷到{{A}}，還是別太顯眼為好。=We are Phantom Thieves after all. Best not be too conspicuous in order to steal the {{A}} safely.
加上我們還不明白{{A}}的內部構造，\n所以還是儘量秘密潛入吧。=And we don't know the {{A}}'s interior structure, let's infiltrate as stealthily as possible.

啊，快看快看！那邊有條路！=Ah, look! There's a road over there!
也許那邊有入口？=<size\=26>Maybe there's an entrance?</size>
過去看看吧=Let's take a look

能從裡面感受到挺多動靜。\n是陰影嗎……也可能是認知存在。=I sense multiple presences coming from within. They could be Shadows... or cognitive beings.
謹慎地前進吧=Let's proceed with caution
沒錯，光害怕也不是辦法。\n總之先進去看看吧！=Yes, it's not good to be scared. Let's go inside anyway!

沒想到，外面這麼誇張，\n結果裡面這麼陰暗啊……=Compared to the flashy exterior, \nthe inside is rather dim...
對啊。破破爛爛的，感覺像個洞窟……=Yeah. It's all run-down, feels like a cave...
而且還有很多陰影。\n不過，它們好像並不在乎我們。=And it's full of Shadows. \nBut they don't seem to mind us.
他們拿著資料到處晃……\n難道是在工作嗎……？=They're shuffling around with documents... \nAre they working?
我得快點寫完這篇報導，\n然後獻給{{A}}才行！=I have to finish this article fast... \nthen present it to {{A}}!
為了{{A}}，我要通宵加班！\n然後要成為她中意的人！=For {{A}}, I will work overtime! Then I will become her favorite!
嗯……「為了{{A}}而工作的工蟻」，\n是這種認知存在吧？=Hmm... so these cognitive beings are "worker ants toiling for {{A}}"?
還說什麼「寫完報導」……\n不會是她{{A}}的同事或下屬吧？=And they mentioned "finishing an article"... Could it be they are her colleague or subordinate from {{A}}?
就是說她把其他員工都當成工蟻？\n這，{{A}}……=So she treats all her employees like worker ants? That's...
畢竟在現實世界，\n她也把身邊那個男的叫做「狗」呢。=Even in the real world, she called that man a "dog".
真是把她的性格暴露得淋漓盡致……\n想必她就是這裡的蟻后了吧？=Her true personality has comes to light... \nGuess she's the queen ant here, huh?
{{A}}的氣息還很遠，\n吾等一邊警戒這些陰影一邊前進吧。=The {{A}}'s presence is still distant. Let's move forward while being cautious of Shadows.

Palace 5 Exploration Part 1
----------
有幅可疑的畫呢。\n這是……{{A}}的肖像畫嗎？=There's a suspicious painting here.\nIs this... a portrait of {{A}}?
唔啊……真的假的啊。\n那傢伙是有多自戀啊……=Huh... seriously? \nJust how full of herself is she...
上面寫著『向女王獻上敬意』……\n是什麼意思呢？=It says "Pay tribute to the Queen"... \nWhat does it mean?
敬意……？\n嗯......對著這張畫鞠躬什麼的？=Tribute...? \nHmm... Do we have to bow or something?
鞠躬了也沒什麼反應呢……\n其他的表達敬意的方式……會是語言嗎？=There's no response even after bowing... Is there any other way to pay tribute... maybe words?
是要稱讚{{A}}的意思嗎？\n我可說不出口！=We have to praise {{A}}?\nNo way I'm saying that!
女王大人最棒了！=<size\=30>Her Majesty is the best!</size>
把我的心獻給女王大人=<size\=26>I dedicate my heart to Her Majesty</size>
唔{{A}}\n這、這是怎麼回事……！？={{A}}\nW-what's going on...!?
{{A}}！？　變成螞蟻了！？\n這樣，不會有事吧……？={{A}}! We're ants!?\nI-is this fine...?
原來如此……看來只要向\n女王的肖像畫表忠誠，就能變成螞蟻的樣子。=I see... It seems that by showing loyalty to the portrait, we can turn into ants.
這樣說不定就可以通過更多的地方了。\n一邊探索一邊調查吧。=Maybe we can pass through more places like this. Let's keep exploring.

對著{{A}}的肖像畫\n說些什麼吧……=Let's say soemthing to {{A}}'s portrait...
把心獻給女王大人！=For Her Majesty!
我才不要當螞蟻呢！=<size\=29>I don't want to be an ant!</size>
什麼都沒有發生……=Nothing happened...
身體發生變化了……！=Our bodies changed...!
WONDER，門開了！=Wonder, the door opened!

快看，這個牆壁上有個洞。\n不過那麼小，好像不太能通過……=Look, there's a hole in this wall. But it's so small, we can't really pass...
不過，如果變成螞蟻是不是就能通過了？=However, we can pass if we turn into ants?
值得一試。\n變成螞蟻後再來看看吧。=It's worth a try. Let's try again after turning into ants.
WONDER，這個樣子怎麼想都進不去吧！=Wonder, there's no way you can enter like this!

嗯？　這個，好像是這裡的地圖吧？=This is the map of this place, right?
嗯……應該是的。路線似乎有些複雜。\n仔細看看吧。=Yes... The route seems a bit complicated. Let's take a closer look.

你是誰？\n這裡容不得『外人』通過。=Who are you?\nNo "outsiders" are allowed.
哦，辛苦了。過去吧。=Oh, hard work. Go ahead.
WONDER，這個太重了……\n想想其他辦法吧。=Wonder, this is too heavy... \nLet's think of something else.

嗯……這扇門打不開呢。\n附近好像也沒有操作裝置……=Hmm... this door can't be opened. Are there's no operating device nearby.
別急，CLOSER。\n你看那是什麼。=Wait, Closer.\nLook what's there.
嗯？\n有點像是……放什麼東西的基座？=Huh? Kinda like a basel for... something?
旁邊還有一顆結晶。\n大小與基座正好一致。=There is a crystal next to it. The size is exactly the same as the base.
啊，我明白了！\n把結晶放在基座上就行了吧！=Ah, I see! Just put the crystal on the base, right?
可惡……什麼鬼東西，\n也太重了吧！！=Damn... what the hell, it's too heavy!!
已經很努力了……卻紋絲不動啊！\n到底該怎麼辦呀這個～！？=I tried so hard... but nothing happened! What should we do?
……WONDER，是不是可以\n用一下那個變身裝置？=...Wonder, how about using that transformation device?
你是指那幅畫？=You mean the painting?
「向女王獻上敬意」？="Pay tribute to the Queen"?
嗯。利用那幅肖像畫變成螞蟻，\n也許就能搬動這個結晶了。=Yes. By using that portrait to turn into ants, maybe we can move this crystal.
這麼一說……聽說螞蟻可以舉起\n大於自身體重數百倍的物體呢。=Come to think of it... ants can lift hundreds of times their own weight.
嗯……值得一試。附近看看\n能不能找到那副肖像畫吧，WONDER。=Yes... it's worth a try. Look around to see if you can find that portrait, Wonder.

門開了！　而且你們注意到了嗎？\n那個吊燈的顏色，和結晶是一致的。=It's open! And did you notice? The chandelier is the same color as the crystal.
今後要是遇到類似的機關，\n也試著注意一下顏色吧，WONDER。=Try to pay attention to the color if we come across similar mechanisms in the future, Wonder.

啊！大家當心！\n前面很危險！=Ah! Look out!\nIt's dangerous!
嗯……斷崖對面有個結晶。\n不過，要怎麼過去呢……=Hmm... There is a crystal opposite the cliff. \nBut how to get there...
看，那些結晶之間……\n像是透過某種能量連接在一起。=Look, those crystals... seem to be connected together by some energy.
類似的結晶這邊也有……\n這邊的好像沒有射出能量呢。=There are similar crystals here as well... But the ones here don't emit any energy.
隊長，這裡有個之前見過的機關。\n要不試試看？=Leader, we've seen this mechanism before, want to try it?
啊！　能量一樣的東西\n也連到這邊來了！=Ah! The energy is now connected here!
嗯……{{A}}這些是……=Hmm... {{A}} these are...
嗯，就好像道路一樣呢。=Yes, it's like the road.
{{A}}？是可以在上面走的意思嗎？={{A}}? Does this mean we can walk on it?
不過現在的我們是螞蟻，說不定真可以！\n試試吧！=But now we're ants, maybe it is possible! Let's try it!

這樣就好了！小菜一碟！=That's it! Piece of cake!
嗯……但可能還會有更複雜的機關。\n現在高興還太早了哦。=Hmm... but there may be more complicated mechanisms. It's too early to celebrate.
不變成螞蟻是過不去的……=Can't cross without becoming an ant...
WONDER，結晶連接起來了！=Wonder, the crystals are connected!

門後可能會有敵人在迎接吾等。\nWONDER，準備好了嗎？=There may be enemies waiting behind this door.\nWonder, are you ready?

{{A}}？這前面沒路了？={{A}}? Maybe this is a dead end?
看上去也沒有樓梯呢。\n如果不能從這裡去往上層的話……=There doesn't seem to be any stairs. If we can't go upstairs from here...
去看看裡面那堵牆？\n雖然有好多陰影圍在那裡……=Check out that wall? Although there are many shadows surrounding it...
反正現在也別無他法了，\n就試著去跟它們搭搭話吧。=Maybe we should try talking to them, since we're at a dead end anyway.
失意的螞蟻陰影=Disappointed Ant Shadow
{{B}}～{{A}}今天還是沒找我！\n明明我一直通宵工作……！={{B}}～ {{A}} still didn't find me! I've been working all night...!
沮喪的螞蟻陰影=Frustrated Ant Shadow
就因為我們不是帥哥嗎……！=Is it because I'm not handsome...!
沒找你？=Didn't find you?
帥哥？=Handsome?
你好阿=Hello
你你、你們誰啊？是新來的嗎？=W-who are you? Are you new?
完蛋，這群人長的還挺帥的啊！\n如果變成我們的同事……=Oh no, these people look handsome! \nIf they become our colleague...
就會奪走{{A}}的寵愛！\n必須現在毀掉他們！！=They will take away {{A}}'s favor! They must be destroyed now!!
把帥哥幼苗扼殺在搖籃裡！=Kill the handome ones in their cradle!
它們在說啥啊……=What are talking about...
{{A}}……是不是可以理解為，\n他們只會攻擊WONDER和SOY？={{A}}... Does this mean they will only attack Wonder and Soy?
那這些陰影就交給你們帥哥二人組啦！=Then I'll leave these Shadows to you handsome duo!
喂，開什麼玩笑啊，\nWIND、CLOSER！=Hey, are you kidding me? \nWind, Closer!
……CLOSER啊，\n為什麼吾不在帥哥列表裡……！=Handsome duo? ...Closer, why am I not on the list...!
那個，\n誰知道CATTLE你是公是母……？=Well, who knows if Cattle's a boy or a girl...?
算了，他們來了！小心應對！=Never mind, here they come! Be careful!

嗯……沒有暗門。\n真的是個死路啊。=Hmm... There is no secret door. \nIt's really a dead end.
難道只有從剛才的入口進去，\n才能到達塔頂嗎？=Can we only reach the top of the tower through that entrance?
那我們先回去看看？\n說不定那些陰影已經離開了呢！=Should we head back and check? Maybe those Shadows have already left!
嗯，判斷和指揮就交給隊長吧。=Right, we'll leave the decisions to the leader.

不行，完全沒有離開的意思……=No good, they haven't budged at all...
乾脆還是把陰影都打倒吧，\n然後直接進去！=Let's just defeat the Shadows and charge in!
……不行。\n我們暫時返回現實世界吧。=...No. We should retreat to the real world for now.
我們對{{A}}所知太少，\n就算強行進入，恐怕也很難有什麼進展。=We know too little about {{A}}. Even if we force our way in, we'd likely make no progress.
……的確。\n目前吾等只知道她是個缺德記者而已。=...True. All we know is that she's an unethical journalist.
而且就算這一點，\n也是從網路報導推測出來的。=And even that's just speculation from online articles.
但除了從網路上查還能怎麼辦呢？\n我們跟她又完全不認識。=But what else can we do besides searching online? We don't know her at all.
畢竟也就只見過兩次面……=After all, we've only met twice...
返回現實世界再考慮吧=Let's plan in the real world
一起想想調查方法吧=<size\=30>Let's brainstorm together</size>
唔，能找到{{A}}就已經是不小的收穫了。\n今天就先回去吧，隊長。=Well, finding the {{A}} is already a great achievement. Let's go back today, leader.

回來了……\n那接下來我們該怎麼調查{{A}}呢？=We're back... So how should we investigate {{A}}?
她是在叫{{A}}的地方工作吧？\n我又不認識什麼出版社的人……=She works at {{A}}, right? But I don't know anyone in publishing...
吾等和{{B}}的唯一交集……\n也就是{{A}}了。=Our only connection to {{B}}... is {{A}}.
不好吧，他可是受害者本人哦？\n哪會想跟我們聊{{A}}的事啊。=No good, he's the victim himself. Why would he want to talk to us about {{A}}.
一碼歸一碼。吾認為，\n打聽一下他之前遭受的不公也無妨。=Call a spade a spade. I think it would be ok to at least ask him about the injustice he suffered.
到時候順口問一下吧=Bring it up casually
叫他去家庭餐廳？=Invite him to a diner?

Choice 1
可以。不過這對{{A}}來說，\n可能是很敏感的話題……=True. But this might be a sensitive topic for Ikenami-kun...
必須要注意說話方式。=We have to be careful with our approach.
Choice 2
唔，刻意叫他出來有點不太自然……\n{{A}}也會有所警惕吧。=Hmm, inviting him directly would seem suspicious... It'd put Ikenami-kun on guard.
在更自然的情況下打聽打聽呢……=Maybe we could ask casually...
比如在排練休息的時候，\n假裝不經意地問問吧。=Like asking casually during a rehearsal break.
還要排練啊……說實話，\n我明天還想集中精力攻略{{A}}呢。=More rehearsals...? Honestly, I wanted to focus on the {{A}} tomorrow.
不，我們還是繼續排練舞臺劇吧。=No, we should continue with the play rehearsals.
畢竟不知道那個幕後黑手……\n會躲在哪裡悄悄觀察我們呢。=Who knows where that mastermind might be watching us from?
在這種時候缺席學校活動，\n會顯得十分惹眼吧。=Skipping school events now would make us stand out too much.
啊，對哦……！\n{{A}}當時也是來我們學校打探{{B}}的！=Oh right...! {{A}} came snooping around our school for the {{B}}!
確實，要是不小心被當做可疑目標，\n可就兩頭空了啊。=Exactly. If we get flagged as suspects, we'll lose on both fronts.
當然無論是調查{{A}}，\n還是攻略{{B}}都需要繼續進行……=Of course, we'll keep investigating {{A}} and infiltrating the {{B}}...
但也得做出學園祭前正常學生的樣子，\n好好準備活動才行呢。=But we should act like normal students preparing for the festival.
sr:"^唔，沒錯。吾也跟(.*)說過，\n你們的本職是學生。$"="Indeed. As I told $1, you are students at heart."
而且無論是努力學習還是享受活動……\n都是為了讓生存慾望更活躍。=Besides, whether it's studying hard or enjoying activities... it's all about making the desire to live more vibrant.
讓生存的慾望更活躍嗎……=Making the desire to live more vibrant...
要我刻苦學習，\n可能反倒會降低慾望呢……=Forcing me to study hard might actually kill my desire instead...
沒錯！+1！=Right! Plus one!

3rd Rehearsal
----------
好，今天我們過一遍第2幕吧。\n先從{{B}}們的母親——{{A}}開始。=Okay, let's go through act 2 today. Starting with the protagonist's mother, {{A}}.
好！就給大家看看……\n我昨天熬夜練習的成果……！=Alright! Let me show you all... The results of my late-night practice..!
「大家～飯做好了喲～」="Everyone～ Dinner's ready～!"
{{A}}，我今天一句臺詞都沒說錯！={{A}}, I didn't mess up a single line today!
唔，不愧是{{A}}……\n我今天又卡詞了……=Hm, as expected from {{A}}...\nI stumbled over my words again...
沒事，大家都進步很快。特別是{{A}}，\n……噗，母親的演技，不得不服。=It's fine. Everyone's improving fast. Especially {{A}}... Pfft, your acting as the mother is unreal.
真的！？耶……沒白練！=For real!? Then... all that practice paid off!
這人還當真了……=...They actually bought it.
大家個性都很突出，演得也很精彩。\n我忍不住畫了好多素描。=Everyone's personalities were so vivid, and the acting was brilliant. I couldn't stop sketching!
能為漫畫帶來靈感？=Inspired your manga?
給我看看素描=Show me the sketches

Choice 1
是的，很多靈感。\n分鏡應該也會畫得很順利。=Yes, so much inspiration. The storyboarding should go smoothly too.
Choice 2
可以啊。\n雖然可能沒什麼意思就是。=That's fine. Though it might not be very interesting.
抱歉事出突然，但明天我需要請個假。=Sorry for the sudden notice, but I'll need to take tomorrow off.
哎呀，是嗎？=Oh, really?
嗯。明天有個約好的雜誌採訪。=Yes. I have a scheduled magazine interview tomorrow.
一本叫「漫畫筆記」的漫畫資訊雜誌，\n要做{{A}}的特輯……=It's for a manga info magazine called "Comic Note", and they're doing a feature on {{A}}...
應該也要刊載對我的採訪內容。=They'll probably include my interview too.
哦哦～採訪！\n不愧是人氣漫畫家啊！=Ooh～ An interview! As expected of a popular mangaka!
對了，我看過新聞呢，\n{{A}}的累計銷量突破500萬冊了。=Yes, I saw the news. {{A}} has sold over 5 million copies in total.
……是啊，托大家的福。=...Yes, thanks to everyone's support.
500萬！？=5 million?!
好強……！也就是說，我想想啊，\n1本是600日元左右？所以銷售額是……=That's insane! Wait, let me think. If one volume is around 600 yen, then the total sales would be...
我平時不怎麼關注稿費這塊。\n版稅也都是讓父母幫我管理。=I don't really pay attention to earnings. My parents handle all the royalties for me.
我只要……能畫漫畫就好。\n在「漫畫筆記」的採訪中我也會這麼說。=I just... want to keep drawing manga. That's what I'll say in the "Comic Note" interview too.
「漫畫筆記」……\n是不是{{A}}的雜誌？="Comic Note"...\nIsn't that from {{A}}?
啊，是的。\n{{A}}竟然知道這麼小眾的雜誌啊。=Ah, yes. I'm surprised you know such a niche magazine, {{A}}.
因為我正好在調查……=Well, I've been looking into...
……調查？=...Looking into?
啊，沒有。沒什麼。=Ah, nothing. Never mind.
啊，{{B}}就是{{A}}在的那家！=Ah, {{B}} is where {{A}} works, right?!
笨蛋！=Idiot!
那個！啊～那個……\n我是說……津、金沙芋泥三明治！好想吃！=Uh! Ah～ Umm... I mean... T-Tsuna... Tuna sandwich! Man, I'm starving!
的、的確肚子餓了=I-I'm starving too
我想吃雞蛋三明治=<size\=30>I want an egg sandwich</size>
金沙金沙金沙～=Tuna tuna tuna～
{{A}}，完全沒起到轉移話題的效果啊……={{A}}, you're not fooling anyone...
你們不會是……\n在調查{{A}}吧？=You guys aren't... looking into {{A}}, are you?
{{B}}！\n就是之前纏著{{A}}的那個女性吧。={{B}}! It's the woman who was pestering {{A}} before.
{{A}}……\n這下全露餡了呢……={{A}}... Guess the cat's out of the bag now...
大家為什麼要特意調查她呢……？=Why would you all go out of your way to look into her...?
啊，不，也不算是調查啦。\n那個人在網上還挺有名的呢。=Oh, no, it's not really investigating. She's just well-known online.
我當時覺得好像在哪兒見過她，\n就順手搜了一下罷了。=I thought I'd seen her somewhere before, \nso I did a quick search. That's all.
哎，她的確是個紅人啦……=Well, she is pretty notorious...
可、可不是嘛！{{A}}似乎也很煩她，\n所以我們好奇她是個什麼來頭……=Y-yeah! And since {{A}} seemed so annoyed by her, we just got curious about what her deal was...
那個……如果大家是因為擔心我，\n所以調查那個人的話，還是算了吧。=Hey... if you're looking into her because you're worried about me, just stop.
最好別跟她扯上關係。=It's better not to get involved with her.
啊不……是說她這人個性很強。\n要是隨便接近她，反倒會弄得自己不愉快。=I mean... she's just really intense. You'll only end up upsetting yourselves if you got involved.
我嘛因為工作關係已經習慣了……\n俗話說，多一事不如少一事嘛？=I'm used to this kind of thing from work... You know what they say, "let sleeping dogs lie"?
你沒事嗎？=Are you okay?
我們擔心你=<size\=28>We are worried about you</size>
……沒事的，不必擔心我。=...I'm fine, don't worry about me.
來，我們繼續排練吧。\n接下來從{{A}}和我的戲開始！=Alright, let's resume practice. We'll start from the scene between {{A}} and me.
{{C}}，剛才{{A}}說的……\n她明天要去{{B}}的事。={{C}}, about what {{A}} just said... her visit to {{B}} tomorrow...
怎麼了？=What's wrong?
也許是潛入的好機會=A chance to infiltrate

Choice 1
你看看能不能一起去？\n比如說參觀之類的……=See if you can go with her? Could make up an excuse like going on a tour...
Choice 2
嗯，我也這麼想。=Yes, I was thinking the same thing.
唔，的確。如果錯過了這次機會，\n想再進入{{A}}內部可就難了。=True. If we miss this opportunity, getting inside {{A}}'s offices will be nearly impossible.
不過，要怎麼開口才好？=But how should we ask?
只能直說了吧？\n就說「我想參觀，能不能帶我去」。=Just be direct? Like "I'd like to visit, mind if I tag along".
或者說，對出版社感興趣什麼的……\n想見識一下漫畫採訪是什麼樣的……？=Or maybe say you're interested in publishing... want to see how manga interviews work...?
你們想看採訪嗎？=Do you want to watch the interview?
哇！？=Wah!?
抱歉。大家剛才聊天時一直在看我，\n所以我比較在意……=Sorry. I noticed everyone kept looking at me while talking, so I was curious...
啊，抱、抱歉。\n打擾到你畫畫了吧……=Ah, s-sorry. We interrupted your sketching...
沒關係的。所以……\n你們是想跟我一起去明天的採訪嗎？=It's fine. So... you said you wanted to come along to my interview tomorrow?
想看看出版社裡面……=Wanted to see inside...
你是不是需要保鏢……=Do you need bodyguard

Choice 1
這樣啊，是單純感興趣吧。=Oh, it's just simple curiosity.
……想看看出版社、電視臺的後臺，\n好奇內部是什麼樣子之類。我懂的。=...Wanting to see behind the scenes at a publisher or TV station. I get it.
Choice 2
……保鏢？保護我嗎？=...Bodyguard? To protect me?
對、對啊！天知道出版社裡會出什麼事？\n所以得來個保鏢……=Y-yeah! Who knows what could happen at a publisher? Better safe than sorry...
能發生什麼呢……我只是去接受採訪而已，\n配保鏢實在是沒必要……=What exactly would happen... It's just an interview, bodyguard seem excessive...
{{A}}，其實我們只是在聊，\n想參觀一下出版社裡面啦。={{A}}, actually, we were just talking about touring the offices.

那個……可以嗎？\n不會打擾到你工作的……=Um... would that be okay? We wouldn't want to disrupt your work...
我沒意見哦。=I don't mind.
{{A}}，可是……！={{A}}, but...!
{{A}}？真的嗎？={{A}}? Really?
我們這些非工作人員去那裡，\n不知道會不會很冒昧……=But would it be rude for outsiders like us to just show up...?
這個我會想辦法的。=I'll do something about that.
不過當然……\n我要先徵得負責編輯的同意才行。=Well, of course... if I get permission from the person in charge.
哦……！沒問題，完全沒問題！\n那就拜託你了，{{A}}！=Oh...! That's totally okay! Please, {{A}}!
謝謝……好開心啊！=Thanks... So excited!
不愧是{{A}}啊……！=<size\=28>As expected from {{A}}...!</size>
你、你們那麼想參觀啊……=You... you all really want to visit that badly...
我知道了。\n那我打個電話確認一下。=Alright then. Let me make a quick call to confirm.
好，今天就到這裡吧。\n那麼，明天見！=Ok, then that's it for today. See you tomorrow!
啊～抱歉，{{A}}！\n我們明天……臨時有事情！=Ah～ Sorry, {{A}}! We... suddenly have something to do tomorrow!
明天可不可以不排練了？=Can we cancel rehearsal tomorrow?
怎麼了，又要考試嗎？\n好。那明天就休息一天。=What is it this time, more tests? \nGot it. We'll take tomorrow off.
{{A}}你要自己好好練，別再卡詞啦。\n拜拜！={{A}}, practice your lines alone, no more stumbling. Later!
那個，關於剛才的事……=About what we discussed earlier...
責任編輯同意了。\n不過，只允許1個人同行……=The editor gave permission. But only one person can come along...
1個人？=One person?
是的，他說一下子出現5個無關人員的話，\n會給採訪造成不便……=Yes, he said five unexpected visitors would disrupt the interview...
大家覺得怎麼樣呢？=What do you all think?
1個人也行=One is fine
怎麼辦……=What to do...

Choice 1
……這樣也行？\n我還以為你們想一起去……=...Is this okay? I thought you all wanted to go together...
啊，當然想啦，不過……\n本就是冒昧的請求，只去1個已經很好啦。=Ah, of course we do, but... it's our sudden request, getting one person to go is already great.
那，{{A}}……\n我們就決定一下誰去吧？怎麼說？=So, uh... How should we decide who goes?
嗯，要說我們這群人的代表……=Hmm, if we're choosing a representative...
Choice 2
抱歉……\n大家肯定還是想一起去參觀吧。=Sorry... I know everyone wanted to visit.
啊，不過畢竟是我們冒昧的請求，\n能去1個人就已經很好啦。=Ah, it's our sudden request, getting one person to go is already great.
沒錯沒錯，{{A}}不用道歉啦。\n應該是我們謝謝你幫忙才對！=Exactly, don't apologize, {{A}}! We should be thanking you for helping!
那，我們決定一下到底誰去吧。\n如果選個代表的話，那肯定是……=Alright, let's decide who's going. If we're choosing a representative, obviously...
感受到了來自大家的熱烈視線……=Felt everyone's enthusiastic gazes...
那我去吧……=Then I'll go...
我不想去……=I don't want to go...
交給我就完事了=Just leave it to me

Choice 1
謝謝。\n果然還得是你呢。=Thanks. I knew I could count on you.
那就拜託啦，我們的隊長！=Then please, our leader!
之後再告訴我們情況哦。=Please give us all the details afterward.
Choice 2
{{A}}！怎麼那麼沒底氣……！？={{A}}! Why are you so unconfident...!?
真是太陽從西邊出來了……=Hell must've frozen over...
我們應付不來啦！\n拜託你了，隊長！=We'd be terrible at this! Please, leader!
Choice 3
不愧是你！\n之後再告訴我們情況哦。=As expected from you! Please give us all the details afterward.
r:"^那就決定了……\n(.*)跟我一起去。$"="Then it's decided...\n$1-senpai will come with me."
對了，明天請穿「常服」來。\n理由的話……到時候就知道了。=Oh, and wear "casual clothes" tomorrow. You'll... understand why when the time comes.
稍後我會發你集合時間什麼的。\n明天還{{A}}。=I'll message you the meeting time and details. Looking forward to working with you tomorrow.

Aran Interview
----------
{{A}}編輯={{A}} Editor
{{A}}，感謝您今天抽出時間接受採訪。\n還{{B}}。={{A}}, thank you for taking the time to be interviewed today. Nice to meet you.
責編御手洗=Editor Mitarashi
我是{{A}}的責編御手洗。\n{{B}}。=I'm Mitarashi, {{A}}'s editor. {{B}}.
我是{{A}}。{{B}}。=I am {{A}}. {{B}}.
然後這位是……=And this is...
嗯，聽說了。是{{A}}的朋友，\n{{B}}新聞部的部長吧。=Ah, I've heard. You're {{A}}'s friend, the president of the newspaper club at {{B}}.
新聞部！？=Newspaper club!?

Choice 1
……{{A}}？\n你不是想把這次採訪登在學校報紙上嗎？=...{{A}}? Didn't you want to publish this interview in the school newspaper?
我是聽{{A}}這麼說的。=That's what {{A}} told me.
嗯，沒錯。\n你別緊張啊，「部長」。=Yes, that's right. Don't be so nervous, "president".

Choice 2
你怎麼了？「部長」。\n是緊張了嗎？=What's wrong, "president"? Are you nervous?
我聽{{A}}說了哦，\n你想把這次採訪刊載到學校報紙上吧。=I heard from {{A}} that you wanted to publish this interview in the school newspaper.
校報嗎，真好啊～\n讓我回憶起了學生時代呢。=A school newspaper, that's nice～ Brings back memories of my student days.

原來如此，{{A}}說你是{{B}}新聞部的，\n他們才同意的吧……=I see, They only agreed to this because {{A}} said you were from {{B}}'s newspaper club...
不過請注意，\n不要劇透今天採訪的內容哦。=However, please be careful not to spoil today's interview contents.
哎呀，今天真是受益匪淺。\n感謝您的配合，{{A}}。=Well, today was truly enlightening. Thank you very much for your time, {{A}}.
客氣了，我才應該道謝。=You're welcome. I should be the one thanking you.
那麼，新聞部的小夥子？\n感覺能寫出報導來嗎？=So, the young man from the newspaper club? Think you can write the article?
報導？=Article?
我有事想問……=<size\=29>I have something to ask...</size>

Choice 1
{{A}}，你沒事吧？\n還在緊張嗎？={{A}}, you okay? Still nervous?
如果你有什麼問題就儘管問哦。=If you have questions, just ask!
Choice 2
啊，是要問問題嗎？歡迎歡迎。=Oh, you want to ask something? Go ahead!
sr:"^好，機會來了，(.*)！\n快問問(.*)的事！$"="Alright, this is your chance, $1! Ask about $2!"
週刊BAKURO的主編……=<size\=20>Editor-in-chief of Weekly BAKURO...</size>

Choice 1
{{B}}，週刊BAKURO的主編？\n……是指{{A}}？={{B}}? The editor-in-chief of Weekly BAKURO? ...You mean {{A}}?
Choice 2
嗯？你說的{{A}}是……\n指我們BAKURO編輯部的嗎？=Hm? The {{A}} you're talking about... Is she from our BAKURO editorial?

{{A}}，為什麼偏偏問起她？\n不會是……投訴什麼的吧？={{A}}, why are you asking about her? Don't tell me... you're filing a complaint?
sr:"^不好，問得太直接了！\n對方似乎有戒心了，(.*)！$"="No, that's too straightforward! They're getting defensive, $1!"
我只是覺得她好漂亮……=I just think she's pretty...
我對醜聞雜誌感興趣……=<size\=25>I'm interested in scandal magazines...</size>

Choice 1
{{A}}～你這也太突然了……\n不過也難怪，畢竟她也算是公眾人物。={{A}}, that's kinda sudden... But I get it, she is a public figure.
Choice 2
{{B}}？也就是說，你崇拜{{A}}？\n這可真是……={{B}}? So you admire {{A}}? That's...
不過，畢竟那個人在網路上確實很有名……=Though, she is pretty famous online..
抱歉啊，關於她我沒什麼好說的。\n如果是我們編輯部的事，我倒可以多說點。=Sorry, I don't have much to say about her. But if it's about our editorial team, I can share more.
看樣子話題進行不下去了……\n怎麼辦才好呢……=Seems like the conversation's hitting a dead end... What to do...
那個……\n其實我們最近見到了那位{{A}}……=Um... actually, we met {{A}} recently...
{{A}}？哇，這是畫的她嗎！？\n畫得好棒！太像了！={{A}}? Wow, is this a drawing of her?! It's amazing! So accurate!
{{C}}？為什麼{{A}}會畫{{B}}？={{C}}? Why would {{A}} draw {{B}}?
最近那個……她來過學校呢。\n大概是對{{A}}有採訪吧……=Well... she recently visited our school. Probably to interview {{A}}...
啊～的確，\n{{A}}跟{{B}}在同一所學校呢。=Ahh～ Right, {{A}} and {{B}} goes to the same school.
然後……那個，她太有存在感了，\n我情不自禁就畫了下來……=And... well, she's so striking, I couldn't help but sketch her...
我經常跟部長提起，\n想把她當做漫畫原型呢……=I keep telling the president I want use her as a manga reference...
啊～那與其說是這位小夥子自己想問，\n其實是替{{A}}問的啊？=Ahh～ So it's not that the young man wanted to ask himself, he was actually asking for {{A}}'s sake, right?
{{A}}，原來如此。\n那個人確實很適合變成漫畫角色呢！={{A}}, I see. That person would actually make a great manga character!
是吧……那，如果您知道些什麼，\n請務必告訴我們……=Right? So... if you know anything about her, please tell us...
對吧，部長？=Right, president?
比如她在社內的軼事……=Like her anecdotes in work...
比如她的個人性格……=Like her personality...
嗯……這個就有點為難我啦……\n你看，我們都有對個人資訊的規定……=Hmm... this is a bit tough for me... You see, we have rules about personal information...
她很有魄力吧=She's very assertive?
她有點可怕吧=She's kind of scary?

Choice 1
啊～那只是對外啦，對外。\n要是在公司裡嘛……哎呀。=Ah～ That's on the outside. Inside the company? Well... umm.
Choice 2
那可不止「有點」哦～！\n先不說對外，在公司裡可是……哎呀。=Not just "kind of"～！Outside the company, sure, but inside... umm.
在公司裡？是什麼樣子的呀？\n我很感興趣……=Inside the company? What's she like? I'm really curious...
不行不行，不能再說下去啦！\n她可是銷冠雜誌的主編，手段高明得很呢！=No, no, I can't say any more! She's the editor-in-chief of a top-selling scandal magazine, she's way too sharp!
要是我再多嘴，\n可是會被開除的……=If I keep running my mouth, I'll get fired for sure...
她那麼有影響力？=She's that influential?
似乎很不好惹啊=<size\=27>Seems difficult to deal with</size>
哎呀停止！\n不是，都說了真的不能聊這個啦！=Stop! Seriously, I can't talk about this!
請放心，我只是當參考消息而已……保證不會告訴其他人的。=Don't worry, I'll just use it as reference... I promise I won't tell anyone.
一定會保密的=I'll keep a secret
您就當吐個槽怎麼樣？=Think of it as venting?
哎……=Ugh...
……其實我最近，分鏡遇到了瓶頸。\n所以想把這麼有個性的人當做參考……=...Truth is, I'm in a slump with my storyboarding lately. Someone with her personality would be perfect reference material...
如果能有點進展，說不定就能接下您那邊畫封面的委託了……=If this helps me make progress, maybe I could even take on that cover illustration commission you mentioned...
真的嗎！\n是說給{{A}}特輯新畫的全彩封面嗎！=Really?! You mean the full color cover for the {{A}} special?
哎呀～那樣的話，我就再多說一點吧。\n但你們真的不要跟別人說……！=Well～ In that case, I guess I can spill a little more. But you swear this stays between us...!
反正，基本跟網上炒的差不多啦。\n再加上公司內部對她的風評……=Anyway, it's pretty much the same as what's online. Plus, there's how she's talked about within the company...
她真的、真的很不好對付，超級難搞！=She's seriously, seriously hard to deal with, super difficult!
然後呢，公司就分成了所謂的：\n「{{A}}派」和「反{{A}}派」啦……=The office is basically split into the "{{A}} faction" and the "Anti-{{A}} faction"...
不對，應該說是給{{A}}拍馬屁的、\n和其他人這兩種吧～=No, more like {{A}}'s bootlickers and everyone else～
畢竟要是不小心被她盯上了，\n是真的會被毀掉的……=Because if she decides you're in her way, she'll ruin you...
所以想在公司生存，不是好好奉承她，\n就是就閉上嘴低調地混日子吧。=To survive here, you have to either get on her good side, or keep your head down and hope she ignores you.
您說的「被毀掉」……是什麼意思呢？=You said "ruined"... what do you mean?
不管提出什麼案子，都會被{{A}}派挑刺，\n比如開會說話被無視，被逼少數服從多數……=Every proposal gets shot down by her faction, ignored in meetings or crushed by peer pressure.
說白了就是職場霸淩。\n連領導也不敢吭聲，任由員工被穿小鞋。=Basically power harassment. Even the boss won't cross her, so you're left unprotected.
她為什麼那麼有權力？=Why is she that powerful?
領導都不敢說不？=<size\=27>Even the boss stays silent?</size>
嗯……應該是因為她年輕的時候，\n搞定過很多獨家新聞，所以確實有真本事。=Well... Back in her early days, she landed many exclusives, so she does have real skills.
加上她也是BAKURO的盈利大頭啦。\n只要她能提高銷量，就沒人出來唱反調。=Plus, she's BAKURO's cash cow. As long as she boosts sales, nobody rocks the boat.
不過……以她現在的手段來看，\n當初那些獨家新聞大概也沒那麼簡單吧。=But... judging by her methods now, those early exclusives probably weren't exactly clean either.
她的手段是指？=What methods?
比如，她會收集一些小道消息，\n就是網上那種邊角料之類……=Like, she'll scrape together rumors, those sketchy online posts...
然後誇大其詞寫成報導，跟親眼見過似的。\n明明根本沒做什麼採訪取證。=Then exaggerate them into reports like she witnessed it firsthand. Even though there's never any interviews or fact-checking.
接著，會讓那些拍她馬屁的人，\n去找「適合這篇報導的假證據」。=Next, she'll have her lackeys "find false evidence that fits the article".
那樣就等於捏造了吧……\n她不會被起訴嗎？=That's just fabrication... Wouldn't she get sued?
當然會。不過你看，我們不是大公司嘛？\n有很厲害的律師呢～=Absolutely. But you see, we're a big company? We have many great lawyers～
而且，她擅長爆料藝人醜聞，\n在娛樂圈面子很大啦……=And she specializes in celebrity scandals, so she wields major influence in the industry...
大多數人都不敢反抗吧。跟她作對的話，\n公司和朋友都不會保護自己的……=Most people wouldn't dare to resist. Cross her, and even your company and friends won't protect you...
好可怕……=So scary...
對吧……但能放這種人橫行霸道，\n我們公司也就這樣啦……=Right?... But that's the kind of thing that goes on in our company....
要是想好好工作的話我可不推薦你來哦。\n雖然工資蠻高的。=If you want to work honestly, I wouldn't recommend this place. Though the pay is good.
啊……不過，你倒是五官很正。\n也許很適合這家公司呢？=Ah... but you have a pretty good face. You might actually fit right in here?
五官很正？=Pretty face?
謝謝誇獎=Thanks for the compliment
哎呀？看來你被誇慣了呀？\n那個人可能喜歡再謙虛點的人呢～=Oh? Used to hearing that, huh? Though she might prefer someone humbler～
反正{{A}}最喜歡顏值高的了……\n如果把她哄好了，她肯定會好好關照你的。=Anyway, {{A}} loves pretty faces... If you play your cards right, she'd definitely take care of you.
至於那到底是福還是禍嘛……=As for whether it is a blessing or a curse...
啊，今天我說的可千千萬萬要保密哦？\n要是被{{A}}知道了……=Ah, what I say today must be kept secret, okay? If {{A}} finds out...
第二天我就會上熱門，\n然後被徹底衝爛了吧……=By tomorrow, I'll be trending online, and then socially executed...

今天辛苦了。=Good work today.
今天可太感謝了=Thanks for today
幫了大忙了=You saved me
我也趁此機會聽到了不少八卦呢。\n看來沒白答應他們畫封面圖。=I also took the chance to hear a lot of gossip. Seems like agreeing to draw the cover art wasn't a waste after all.

sr:"^啊！他在那兒！\n(.*)！$"="Ah! He's over there! $1!"
{{A}}……？\n大家這是怎麼了？={{A}}...? What happened to you all?
sr:"^啊，我們很擔心(.*)，\n所以就來(.*)邊逛邊等……$"="Ah, we were worried about $1, so we came to $2 to look around while waiting..."
來{{B}}……？\n{{A}}明明是在神保町吧？=To {{B}}...? But {{A}} is in Jinbocho?
啊，不是，那個……！\n今天不排練，所以我們想來吃頓好的！=Ah, no, that's...! We don't have practice today, so we wanted to eat something delicious!
……這樣啊。\n果然大家也都很想知道{{A}}的事呢。=...I see. So everyone's also curious about {{A}}.
也就是說……「{{B}}的下一個目標」，\n是{{A}}，對嗎？=That means... "The {{B}}' next target", is {{A}}, right?
{{A}}？你剛剛說什麼……={{A}}? What did you just say...
你你你在說什麼？=<size\=23>Wh-what are you talking about?</size>	
沒有必要掩飾啦。=There's no need to hide it.
哦！？=Oh!?
r:"^這個是(.*){{A}}包裡的……\n貓頭鷹，對吧？$"="This is the owl... in $1-senpai's bag, right?"
看看看錯了吧？=<size\=28>You must be mistaken?</size>	
你、你認錯鳥了吧？=<size\=27>You got the wrong bird?</size>	
是嗎？貓頭鷹在這裡可不常見哦。\n而且我覺得特徵也對得上……=Is that so? Owls aren't common around here. And I think the features match...
另外，我還親眼看到了。\n大家準備發{{A}}的一幕。=Besides, I saw it with my own eyes. The moment you all were preparing to send the calling card.
什麼……！=What...!
在{{A}}地鐵站的臺階那裡……=On the stairs at {{A}} Station...
你們聚在一起，在聊發{{A}}的事情吧？\n然後就拿起手機……=You all got together and were discussing sending the calling card, right? Then you started using your phone...
接著，{{A}}上就出現了……\n發給{{B}}的影片{{C}}。=And soon after, a video calling card appeared on {{A}}... The one sent to {{B}}.
被你看到了……=You saw it...
你看錯了……=<size\=29>You must be mistaken...</size>	
請放心。\n我並不打算舉報你們。=Please rest assured. I have no intention of reporting you.
也沒打算告訴任何人你們的真正身份。\n我只不過是……對大家很感興趣而已。=Nor will I reveal your true identities to anyone. I'm simply... very interested in all of you.
感興趣……？=Interested...?
我不是說過了嗎？\n作為採訪對象，大家能激發我的靈感。=Didn't I say it before? As interview subjects, you all inspire me.
真的是……因為這個？\n{{A}}，莫非你要把我們……=Is that... really all? {{A}}, are you planning to use us...
我沒有其他目的。\n我只想看看你們在做什麼，僅此而已。=No ulterior motives. I simply want to observe your activities, nothing more.
真正的怪盜……\n應該可以成為{{A}}的參考吧。=Real Phantom Thieves... Could serve as good references for {{A}}.
我們還沒說過自己是「怪盜」。\n就算假設我們是……=We haven't admitted to being "Phantom Thieves". But let's say we are...
也希望你不要把我們的真人畫進漫畫。=I hope you will avoid writing our true identities in the manga.
這點也請放心。\n你們只是靈感來源，不會出現真實名字的。=Don't worry about that either. I'm just trying to get some inspiration, I won't use real names.
所以，如果不介意的話，\n今後我也想繼續觀摩大家的活動……=So, if you don't mind, I'd like to continue observing your activities from now on...
然後像今天這樣，\n如果有需要的地方，我也會幫忙的。=Just like today, if there's anything you need help with, I'll gladly assist.
我考慮一下=I'll think about it
需要徵求大家的意見=Need everyone's input
……我知道了。=...Understood.
請放心，我真的不會打擾你們的。\n那我先告辭了。=Rest assured, I have no intention of getting in your way. I'll take my leave now.
怎怎怎怎！麼！辦！啊！\n露餡了！這不是露餡了嘛喂！！=Wh-wh-wh-what! What do we do now! We're exposed! Completely exposed!!
都怪{{A}}被拍下來了！=It's all because {{A}} got caught on camera!
吾也沒辦法吧！\n還不是因為你們在車站聊{{A}}的事！=It's unavoidable! You were the ones talking about the calling card at the station!
……不過的確，我們總是嘴上說要小心，\n但結果根本沒做到啊……=...But it's true. We always say we'll be careful, but we never actually are...
總之先冷靜一下=Let's stay calm
先緩一緩再說吧=Take a breather first
sr:"^……是啊。\n(.*)想必也累了。$"="...Yeah. $1 must be tired too."
而且這裡人太多了。\n包括{{A}}的事，都等明天在基地聊吧。=And there are too many people here. We should talk about {{A}} and everything else tomorrow at the hideout.
可是，萬一{{A}}今天就對誰告密了……=But what if {{A}} reports us to someone today...
那我們很可能會被幕後黑手殺掉啊……！=Then we will most likely be killed by the mastermind...!
沒事吧……應該。=We'll be fine... probably.
如果她跟「幕後黑手」有關的話，\n我覺得她不會特意跑來找我們說這些的……=If she is connected to the "mastermind", I don't think she would have bothered to tell us...

----------
Day After Exposed by Aran
----------
{{A}}。吾一直都覺得她很可疑，\n原來是知道吾等的身份才來接觸的啊……={{A}}. I always thought she was suspicious, it turns out that she came to contact us because she knew our identities...
雖然露餡了是我們的錯……=Even if it was our fault that we got found out...
但她既不鬧，也不在{{A}}上投稿，\n只悄悄接近我們……我都起雞皮疙瘩了……=But she didn't make a scene or post about it on {{A}}, just quietly approached us... Gives me goosebumps...
錯不了，她就是幕後黑手的手下之類的吧？=No doubt about it, she's probably the mastermind's lackey or something?
就算是，\n我也不明白為什麼她要特意跟我們挑明。=Even if she is, I don't get why she even bothered to tell us.
如果是覺得我們礙眼，想除掉我們……\n暗中偷襲不是更方便嗎？=If she saw us as a threat and wanted to eliminate us... Wouldn't it be easier to ambush us in secret?
雖然她說是「感興趣」「想幫忙」之類……=Although she said she's "interested" and "wants to help"...
不能放鬆警惕=<size\=29>Can't let our guard down</size>
想要相信她=Want to trust her
Choice 1
是啊。肯定不能把我們的怪盜活動，\n那麼輕易地全盤托出。=Yes. We definitely can't just casually spill everything about our Phantom Thief activities.
而且我們是在{{A}}活動，\n沒法給她看啊。=Plus, we operate in the {{A}}, we can't really show her.
不過，\n我們如果刻意回避她的話也很危險。=But if we deliberately avoid her, that's risky too.
如果她真是敵人，\n這樣反而會刺激到她……=If she really is an enemy, that will only irritate her...
Choice 2
sr:"^你這也太天真了吧，(.*)。$"="You're way too naive, $1."
我懂你。我也覺得她雖然有點怪，\n但其實是個好孩子……=I get it. I also think she's a little odd, but I also think she's a good person...
那也不能就這麼相信她，然後交代一切。\n但反過來想……=Still, we can't just blindly trust her and reveal everything. But on the other hand...
如果徹底回避她的話，也很危險。=If if we deliberately avoid her, that's risky too.
畢竟，她如果真的是敵人，\n這樣反而會刺激到她……=After all, if she really is an enemy, that will only irritate her...
那我們該怎麼辦啊？=Then what should we do?
跟之前一樣，當做兩校合演的團隊成員，\n和她正常接觸就行了吧？=Just keep things as usual, play the joint play collaborators role and act normal, right?
正常聊天，正常回家。\n但是我們不要主動聊起工作的話題。=Chat normally, go home normally. But we don't talk about the work ourselves.
那要是{{A}}問起來怎麼辦？=What if {{A}} asks about it?
那就只好說無可奉告了吧……\n畢竟隨便敷衍是行不通的。=Then we'll have to say we can't disclose that... No point in being evasive anyway.
不撒謊，也不敷衍，只說「無可奉告」？\n感覺很好辦呢！=No lying, no being evasive, just "I can't disclose that"? Think I can do that!
就說雖然無法告訴她工作的細節，\n但希望能正常做朋友……這樣吧。=Let's tell her we can't discuss work specifics, but we'd still like to stay on good terms...
唔，確實這樣比較穩妥呢。=Hmm, that would be the more judicious approach.
如果她還是執意打聽的話，\n吾等再考慮下一步的對策吧。=If she keeps pressing for info, then we'll figure out our next move.
sr:"^那麼，(.*)。\n接下來你來說說在(.*)打聽到的消息吧。$"="Then, $1. Let's share what you found out at $2."
她在公司裡名聲也這麼差啊……\n真是從裡到外都壞透了。=She even has such a bad reputation in the company... She's rotten to the core.
不出所料啊。\n這種人，也難怪能到處瞎寫虛假報導。=Just as I expected. She just wrote a bunch of exaggerated articles.
是啊，整個公司都知道了的話，\n那肯定不是一次兩次了。=Yeah, if the whole company knew about it, it must've happened more than once or twice.
而且，\n在公司裡她是被馬屁精們捧著的吧？=And in the company, she's surrounded by bootlickers, right?
那在{{A}}也一樣？=<size\=24>It's the same in the {{A}}</size>
所以反映到了認知中？=<size\=29>That's reflected in her cognition</size>
原來如此！{{B}}裡的那些螞蟻們，\n之所以那麼討好{{A}}……=I see! That's why the Shadows in her {{B}} were all fawning over {{A}}...
就是因為對於她來說，\n全公司都是阿諛奉承她的僕人吧。=To her, the whole company is just many yes-men.
{{A}}，真過分……={{A}}, that's terrible...
這樣一來，\n如果要通過被陰影們堵住的那個入口……=So if we want to get past that entrance blocked by Shadows...
就要成為她的下屬=<size\=27>Have to become her lackey</size>
必須被她看中=Need to win her favor
應該沒錯。只不過……\n要怎樣才能「被她相中」呢？=That should be correct. But... how do we "win her favor"?
sr:"^(.*)，那個(.*)編輯說過，\n你的顏值不錯，可能會被相中哦……$"="$1, that editor at $2 said, you have a pretty face, she might take a liking to you..."
顏值！？什麼意思？=Pretty face!? What's that supposed to mean?
sr:"^啊，我記得在中央大街的時候也是，\n她好像挺中意(.*)和(.*)的吧？$"="Ah, back in the Central Street, she seemed to like $1 and $2, right?"
sr:"^的確！啊，那就讓(.*)和(.*)，\n一起色誘(.*)……？$"="Exactly! Ah, then what if $1 and $2 try to, seduce $3...?"
開什麼玩笑=Are you kidding me
我不想幹……=I don't want to...
加油啊，{{A}}！=Keep it up, {{A}}!
Choice 1
就是啊！\n這也太強人所難了吧！=That's right! This is too much to ask!
Choice 2
sr:"^對吧！？\n還好(.*)我倆一條心……$"="Right!? Glad we're on the same page, $1..."
Choice 3
別光甩給我啊！\n而且這跟加不加油有啥關係啊！=Don't just dump this on me! And what does "keep it up" even mean here!
嗯，確實太冒險了……\n暫且把它作為我們的底牌吧。=Yes, it is too dangerous... Let's keep it as a last resort.
別隨便搞這種底牌啊……=Don't just casually add it as a last resort...
……嗯，下午的課馬上要開始了。=...Hmm, the afternoon classes are about to start.
總之先回教室吧。\n大家回去都想想接近{{A}}的辦法。=Let's head back to the classroom for now. Everyone, think of ways to get close to {{A}}.
sr:"^今天也要排練哦！\n去體育館吧，(.*)。$"="We've got rehearsal today too! Let's go to the gym, $1."
好的，走吧！=Alright, let's go!
還有事情要做=Got things to do
喔，真有幹勁啊！\n那就趕緊去體育館吧，Let's go！=Oh, you're really motivated! Then let's hurry to the gym! Let's go!
啊，難道是要去小賣部買點東西吃嗎……？\n{{A}}，開玩笑的啦！那就等會兒再見囉！=Ah, going to the store to buy some snacks...? {{A}}, just kidding! See you later!

----------
4rd Rehearsal
----------
……嗯，我一切都很好。\n媽媽你呢？=...Mmm, I'm doing just fine. What about you, mom?
這樣啊，那就好。=I see, that's good to hear.
我爸？嗯，還是那麼忙。\n……我有好好吃飯，放心吧。=Dad? Yes, still as busy as ever. \n...Don't worry, I've been eating properly.
學校這邊也都很順利。\n對，在忙戲劇部的事。馬上就要比賽了。=School's going well too. Yes, the drama club has a competition coming up.
大家人都很好，我們相處得很開心哦。=I'm surrounded by great friends, we get along great.
……媽媽你為什麼道歉啊。\n沒必要的。=...Mom, why are you apologizing? There's no need for that.
好，媽媽你也要注意身體。\n那先這樣。嗯，Ciao（再見）。=Alright, you take care of yourself too. That's all for now. Yes, Ciao (Goodbye).
你們來啦。\n怎麼了？幹嘛杵在那裡。=Yo. What's up? Why just standing there?
你剛才在打電話？=<size\=30>Were you on the phone?</size>
「媽媽」？="Mom"?
{{A}}，被你們聽到了啊。\n對，我跟我媽會定期電話聯繫。={{A}}, you heard that. Yes, I call my mom regularly.
她在國外生活，\n所以這樣時不時互相聊聊近況。=She lives abroad, so we check in like this from time to time.
{{A}}……你跟媽媽不住在一起啊？\n是因為工作嗎？={{A}}... you don't live with your mom? Is it because of work?
嗯。我媽太忙了，要到處跑。\n所以就住在國外了。=Hm. Mom's always traveling for work, so she stays overseas.
每年大概回日本一兩次吧。=She comes back to Japan maybe once or twice a year.
好辛苦啊=That sounds tough
你不會想她嗎？=Don't you miss her?
畢竟從小就這樣，我已經習慣啦。=I've been used to it since I was little.
我很尊敬她能以事業為重。\n而且就像剛才那樣，我們也常聯繫。=I really respect her dedication to her career. And like you just heard, we keep in touch.
所以……嗯，沒什麼好寂寞的。=So... well, there's nothing to be lonely about.
來，我們進體育館吧。快點排練！=Come, let's head inside the gym. Time for rehearsal!
剛才他在電話裡……\n他說跟{{A}}戲劇部「關係很好」……=Earlier on the phone... He said he "gets along great" with the {{A}} drama club...
不知道是不是不想告訴母親，\n自己與戲劇部的人其實有矛盾……=I wonder if he didn't want to tell his mom about the tension between him and the others...
好了，今天我們來全部過一遍吧。\n從第一幕到最後一幕，一口氣哦！=Alright, today we're running through the whole thing. From the first scene to the last scene, nonstop!
「呼，看來今天到此為止了。\n期待再會，{{A}}的各位！」="Whew, looks like that's it for today. Until we meet again, members of the {{A}}!"
「等著瞧……\n我們一定會追上你的……」="Just you wait... We'll catch up to you someday..."
「然後，奪回幸福的未來！\n我們是……」="And take back our happy future! We are..."
三人=Three People
「{{A}}！」="{{A}}!"
好，很不錯！=Alright, okay!
好耶，我們這還是頭一回一口氣演完吧！\n而且感覺演得還很不錯啊！是吧！=Woohoo! This is the first time we've performed it all in one go! And I feel like the acting was pretty good! Right!
就是很棒吧？\n雖然還有點小錯。=It was awesome, wasn't it? Even though there were a few hiccups.
就算是忘詞的地方，\n大家也都能靠即興表演連下去呢。=Even when someone forgot a line, everyone just improvised through it smoothly.
這證明大家已經把整部戲都牢牢記住了，\n是把角色演活了的證明哦。=That proves you've all internalized the script, it's a sign you've become your characters.
我們做到了！=We did it!
{{A}}覺得呢？=<size\=22>What do you think, {{A}}?</size>
{{A}}你覺得呢？=<size\=29>What do you think, {{A}}?</size>
是在問我作為原作者的意見嗎？\n嗯……=Are you asking for the author's opinion? Hmm...
我覺得大家都能準確解讀角色，演得很好。=I think everyone really understood their characters and acted them out wonderfully.
嗯，我覺得和剛開始的時候相比，\n大家簡直進步太多了。=Yes, compared to when you first started, the improvement is unbelievable.
就算作為一名普通觀眾，\n我也看得相當滿足。=Even just as an audience member, I was thoroughly impressed.
當然也還有些不足，\n比如{{A}}經常說不順臺詞……=Of course, there's still room for improvement, like {{A}} stumbling over his lines...
嗚，抱歉啊！=Ugh, sorry about that!
不過……能切實感受到{{A}}的熱情。\n就像真的「媽媽」一樣呢。=But... I could feel {{A}}'s passion. It was like watching a real "mother".
真假，我演出了真正的「媽媽」……！=For real, I played a real "mother"...!
等等，我該高興嗎……？=Wait, should I be happy...?
r:"^(.*){{C}}、{{A}}，\n還有{{B}}，大家都很認真。$"="$1-senpai, {{A}}, and {{B}}, you were all so serious."
雖然和漫畫中的{{A}}們不完全一樣，\n但是大家演出了各自心目中的形象……=Though it's not exactly like the manga protagonists, you brought your own interpretations to life...
啊，沒事。\n{{A}}的演技真的很厲害。=Ah, right. {{A}}'s acting was excellent as expected.
……看起來你像是欲言又止啊。\n用不著顧慮，有話直說吧。=...Looks like you're hesitant to speak. Don't worry, just say what you're thinking.
沒有，請別在意。\n我對演技可是門外漢。=No, it's nothing. Please ignore me. I'm no expert on acting.
不，拜託你了。對演員來說，\n批評也是演技的源泉。=No, please. For actors, criticism is also a source of skills.
你就直說吧。=Just say it straight.
……那好吧。\n如果我說錯了，還請你不要介意。=...Right. If I'm wrong, please don't mind.
我剛剛突然發現，我好像……\n對{{A}}的演技「沒印象」。=It just hit me... I have "no impression" of {{A}}'s performance.
素描也是……明明其他人都畫了好多，\n但{{A}}的卻沒幾幅。=Even in the sketches... I drew so many of the others, but barely any of {{A}}.
不過畢竟演的是壞人角色，\n也許你是特意這麼表現的……=Though, since you're playing the villain, maybe that was intentional...
總之……\n感覺是種沒有留下印象的演技。=Anyway... it's like your acting left no impression.
我太沒禮貌了。對不起。\n也許是因為演得太好了，才沒留下痕跡呢。=That's rude. Sorry. Maybe it was so good that it didn't leave much of an impression.
不……你說得太對了。\n不愧是{{A}}，觀察力很強。=No... you're absolutely right. As expected from {{A}}, you have a keen eye.
劇團的夥伴也對我說過同樣的話。\n他們說，在我的表演中看不到「我自己」。=The drama club members said the same thing. They told me they couldn't see "myself" in my acting.
你自己？=Youself?
他們說我演得很好，也很有感染力。\n但是……「感覺不一定非要我來演」。=They said I acted well and was very charismatic. But... "it didn't have to be me acting it".
要是配角倒還行，但作為主角的話，\n無法給人留下深刻印象是不合格的。=It's fine for a side character, but as a lead, failing to leave an impact is a failure.
真的假的……要我說，\n總之就是演得很好啊……=For real... I mean, I thought you were great...
我也是……=Me too...
我也覺得演技很好=<size\=21>I also thought the acting was great</size>
大概就是有技術，但缺乏激情吧。\n這樣是當不了明星的。=It's like having skill but lacking passion. I can't become a star like this.
哦，\n就像是味道不錯但沒特點的拉麵嗎……=Oh, it's like ramen that tastes good but has no distinctive features...
啊，抱歉！=Ah, sorry!
{{A}}，沒事。我覺得你的比喻很恰當。=Haha, no worries. That's actually a perfect analogy.
只不過這個問題……\n在學園祭之前恐怕是克服不了了。抱歉。=It's just this... isn't something I can fix before the school festival. My apologies.
這就是{{A}}作為演員，\n今後要攻克的課題吧。=This is one of {{A}}'s future challenges as an actor.
沒錯。{{A}}，謝謝你。\n抱歉讓你說了些難以啟齒的話。=Exactly. Thank you, {{A}}. And sorry for making you say something difficult.
沒關係……=It's okay...
那，時間不早了。\n今天就到這裡吧。=Well, it's getting late. Let's call it a day.
好的，各位辛苦了。\n今天我還有工作要做，先告辭了……=Okay, everyone, good work today. I have work today, so I'll go first...
我說……\n{{A}}是不是有點失落啊？=Hey... Did {{A}} seem kinda down to you?
應該是在想{{A}}的話吧……=Probably thinking about what {{A}} said...
這種時候就是那個了，{{A}}！=It's time, {{A}}!
這種時候就去吃拉麵吧！=Time for ramen!
……你是說拉麵嗎！=...Did you say ramen!
是啊！拉麵！=Yes! Ramen!
嗯？拉麵？=Huh? Ramen?
沒錯，我知道家超級好吃的拉麵！\n我們一起去吧，{{A}}！=Right, I know an amazing ramen place! Let's go together, {{A}}!
{{A}}，你們要去吃拉麵嗎！？\n那我也要去！={{A}}, you guys are getting ramen!? \nI wanna go too!
不行哦，{{A}}。不是說今天回去時，\n要一起去看女生服裝的布料嗎？=No, {{A}}. Didn't we say we'd check out fabrics for girls' outfits on the way back?
哎呀……！我想起來了……！=Oops...! I remembered...!
下次再大家一起吧=<size\=28>Let's go together next time</size>
等什麼時候有機會=<size\=26>When we get another chance</size>
也是，今天{{A}}也不在。\n那你們3個吃好哦～=Right, {{A}} is not here either. Then you three enjoy the meal～
我們就先走啦。=We'll take our leave.
好，那今天就來一場男人們的拉麵大餐！\n我們走起，{{A}}！=Right, let's have a ramen feast for the guys today! Let's go, {{A}}!
噢、噢……？=O-oh...?

嗯……Buono！！=Mmm... Buono!!
這拉麵什麼來頭啊……！\n也太好吃了吧！=What's this ramen...! It's so good!
我就說吧！\n關鍵是這個湯底，鰹魚湯底！=Told you! The key is the broth, bonito broth!
Buono？=Buono?
剛才說的是義大利語嗎？=Was that Italian just now?
啊，我又說順嘴了。\n抱歉，因為拉麵太好吃了，不小心就……=Ah, I said it again. Sorry, the ramen was just so good, it came out naturally...
對哦，{{A}}偶爾會說外語呢。\n「Bravo」，還有B……「Bene」？=Yeah, {{A}} sometimes throws in foreign words. Like "Bravo" and B... "Bene"?
Bene是義大利語「OK」的意思，\nBravo是「很棒」的意思。=Bene means "OK" in Italian, Bravo means "great".
Buono的話，就是「好吃」的意思啦。=And "Buono" means "tasty".
我媽媽是義大利人，\n所以從小就耳濡目染了。=My mom is Italian, so I picked it up growing up.
真的嗎！\n那……你爸爸是日本人嗎？=For real! Then... your dad is Japanese?
沒錯，我是義大利和日本混血。=Yes, I'm half Italian and half Japanese.
雖然我基本是聽日語長大的，\n不過語氣詞什麼的還是受我媽媽的影響。=Although I basically grew up speaking Japanese, my little interjections and such are still influenced by my mom.
一放鬆下來就會不小心說出口……=When I relax, they just slip out...
你隨時都可以放鬆的=You can relax anytime
希望在我們面前你能做自己=<size\=25>Hope you can be yourself around us</size>
嗯，但是……=Hmm, but...
sr:"^就是呀，(.*)說得對，\n做自己就行啦！難得現在只有男生呢！$"="Come on, $1's right, just be yourself! It's just us guys here anyway!"
嗯……啊～=Hmm... Sigh～
今天{{A}}說的……\n從我的演技裡「看不到我自己」……=Today, what {{A}} said... that she "couldn't see myself" in my acting...
其實不止是演戲。=It's not just about acting.
不止是在舞臺上。\n我平時也老這樣，不袒露真正的自己……=Not just on stage. Even in everyday life, I don't show my true self...
我總是在「撒謊」。=I'm always "lying".
撒謊是指……=Lying...
就是字面意思啦。\n不管對誰，我都沒展現過真正的自己。=Literally. I don't show my true colors in front of anyone.
這感覺就像是……\n我一直在飾演「{{A}}」這個角色。=It's like... I've been playing the role of "{{A}}".
可……不過……\n這跟撒謊可是兩碼事吧？=But... that's not the same as lying, right?
但也肯定不是「誠實」。=But it's definitely not "honest", either.
事到如今……連我自己都忘了，\n究竟要如何展現真正的自我了。=At this point... I don't even remember how to show my true self.
只有像這樣吃到好吃的，\n或者剛演出完很興奮的時候……=Only when eating something incredible, or right after a show when I'm still buzzing...
才能找回一點真正的自己……=That's when I feel like my true self is coming back...
而在平時，\n隱藏自己已經成了一種習慣了。=But the rest of the time, hiding's just second nature.
為什麼要這麼做？=Why do this?
是跟家裡有關係嗎？=Is it related to family?
sr:"^(.*)知道，\n我媽媽一直住在義大利。$"="$1 knows, my mother has always lived in Italy."
sr:"^……猜對了。(.*)知道吧，\n我媽媽一直住在義大利。$"="...Bingo. $1 knows, my mother has always lived in Italy."
不是說我父母人不好，或者關係差哦？\n我很喜歡他們，也很尊敬他們。=Not that my parents are bad people or have a bad relationship. I love and respect them.
只不過……嗯，因為一些原因，\n我們一家不得不兩地分居。=But... well, for some reasons, we had to live apart.
一些原因？=Some reasons?
這個嘛～就是我的私事啦。\n不，不如說是父母的私事。=That's～ More of a personal matter. Or rather, my parents' private matter.
反正就因為這個……\n在父母面前，我就一直扮演著好孩子。=Anyway, because of that... I've always played the good child in front of them.
為了不讓他們擔心，不給他們添麻煩，\n我就藏起了感情，成了這麼個人。=In order not to make them worry and cause them trouble, I hid my feelings, and became this.
不過他們真的是很好的父母哦？\n夫妻關係很好，也都很愛我，我懂。=But they're really great parents. They love each other, they love me, I know that.
但這大概就是我的本性。\n這麼一想，就更覺得對不起他們……=But maybe this is just who I am. And that just makes me feel even guiltier...
我……能理解{{A}}。不想讓父母擔心，\n所以不能讓他們看到真正的自己。=I... get it, {{A}}. Not wanting to burden your parents, so you can't show them your true self.
我是單親家庭，老媽工作非常辛苦。\n為了不讓她擔心……=I grew up with a single mom who worked herself to the bone. In order to not make her worry...
比如我想她啦，還有學校裡的事啦……\n這些我都故意不去跟她說。=Things like I missed her, or stuff at school... I won't deliberately tell her those.
怎麼說呢……就因為愛自己的爸媽，\n所以才有話說不出口……吧。=How to say it... There are some things you can't say because you love your parents...
是吧。對了，你也別總對我用敬語了。\n隨意就好，隨意。=Yes. Right, and drop the honorifics when addressing me. Just talk normally.
真的？那就，{{B}}！\n……不對，還是得叫{{A}}吧？=Seriously? Then, {{B}}! ...No, I should still call you {{A}}.
sr:"^就叫我(.*)就行，我也直接叫你(.*)。\n(.*)也是哦！$"="Just call me $1, and I'll just call you $2. You too, $3!"
現在的{{A}}就在做自己=<size\=29>The {{A}} now is the true self</size>
{{A}}的語氣也完全不同了=<size\=26>{{A}}'s tone is completely different</size>
{{A}}，的確！\n因為這拉麵太好吃了，嘴都軟了。={{A}}, true! The ramen's so good, I'm acting soft.
事到如今，\n也沒必要在你們面前裝酷擺架子了。=At this point, there's no need to keep acting cool around you guys.
{{A}}，原來你之前都在裝酷啊。={{A}}, turns out you were just pretending to be cool.
那當然啦。\n畢竟我的影片那麼紅，還登過雜誌。=Of course. After all, my video went viral and had even been featured in magazines.
所以我覺得……\n應該「演」得更像模像樣一點吧。=So I figured... I had to "act" the part.
已經不用演了=<size\=30>No need to act anymore</size>
做{{A}}自己就好=Just be {{A}}
……我也覺得！=...I think so too!
那我就直說了，我還沒吃飽呢！\n不然再加份麵吧！=Then I'll say it straight, I'm still hungry! Let's order another bowl!
說得好！那乾脆再來一碗！\n除了醬油拉麵，味噌拉麵也很棒哦。=Now we're talking! Let's have a second one! Soy ramen's good, but miso's killer too.
Bravo！好！\n打擾一下，我想點單！=Bravo! Right! Excuse me, we'd like to order!
啊～吃飽了吃飽了。\n糟了，接下來得節食了啊。=Ah～ So full. Oh no, I have to go on a diet after this.
是該鍛煉吧，練肌肉。\n把吃的變成肌肉就行啦。=Just exercise and build muscle. Turn all this food into gains.
畢竟肌肉永遠可靠=Muscles are forever
看！我的肌肉！=Look! My muscles!
{{A}}，\n果然男生一起玩就很開心啊！={{A}}, it's fun hanging out with the guys!
說實話，有女孩子時我總是小心翼翼的……\n這和隱藏真實的自己又不是一回事。=Honestly, I'm always on guard around girls... though that's different from hiding myself.
跟女生說話的時候，\n難道你們不緊張嗎？=You guys get nervous talking to girls too, right?
我懂！\n會很怕說錯話啥的。=Totally! Always worried about saying the wrong thing.
我還以為{{A}}你不會這樣呢。\n畢竟不是總有女生圍著你轉嘛？=I thought you wouldn't be like this, {{A}}. Aren't there always girls around you?
就算是粉絲，我也會緊張啊！=Even with fans, I still panic!
為何聚集在我周圍的都是女孩子……\n這是為何、為何……！=Why is it always girls around me... Why, why...!
搞了半天你還是在炫耀阿！=You're still showing off!
不不，我真不是在炫耀！\n我現在超想聊一些很蠢的話題！=No, no, I'm really not! I really want to talk about something dumb right now!
讓我們來一場只有男孩子才懂的、\n無聊吹牛大會吧！！=Let's have a stupid bragging session that only guys can understand!!
就這樣三個人一起，\n因為各種無聊至極的話題大笑……=The three of us laughed at all kinds of stupid topics together...
啊～今天真是「吃飽笑足」了……\n好久沒這麼開心過了呢。=Ah～ We really "live it up" today... Haven't had this much fun in ages.
{{A}}，我還有家推薦的店呢。\n下次我們去那家吧。={{A}}, I know another great shop. Let's hit it up next time.
Bene！我期待著呢。=Bene! Looking forward to it.
那，今天謝謝你們啦！\n明天見，Ciao！=Alright, thanks for today! See you tomorrow, Ciao!
哦～Ciao！=Yeah～ Ciao!

----------
5th Rehearsal
----------
好，大型道具都差不多了。\n就剩下一些小道具了。=Okay, the large props are mostly done. Now we just have some small props left.
比如{{A}}們的武器，\n必須要好好製作才行～！=Like the weapons for the protagonists, we need to make sure they're well-crafted～!
嗯。{{A}}，能給我看一下人設圖嗎？=Hmm. {{A}}, can I see the character design illustrations?
啊，好的。給你。=Ah, sure. Here you go.
原來如此……這個的話，\n應該能用泡沫塑膠之類的材料搞定？=I see... For this, maybe we can use foam or something similar?
哇，{{A}}的武器啊！\n我超想用用看呢！=Wow, the {{A}}'s weapons! I'd love to try using them!
啊……話說回來，我們還得準備服裝呢！=Ah... Speaking of which, we still need to prepare the costumes!
還有負責音響、燈光的工作人員呢……\n我問過其他{{A}}了，他們都很忙。=And the staff for sound and lighting... I asked the other {{A}}s, but they're all busy.
另外，{{B}}和{{A}}，\n雖然能一人分飾好幾個角色……=Also, {{B}} and {{A}} can each play multiple roles, but...
但有些場景行不通吧。\n尤其是這場戰鬥戲……=Some scenes just won't work. Especially this fight scene...
對。剛演完一個雜兵，\n馬上又作為BOSS登場的確有點兒傻……=Right. It's a bit silly to appear as a boss right after appearing as a small fry...
起碼再來1個……\n不，最好能再來3個演員啊……=We need at least one more... No, ideally three more actors...
{{A}}說她已經答應要給各種攤位幫忙，\n所以來不了……={{A}} said she's already promised to help with various stalls, so she can't make it...
sr:"^(.*)有沒有合適的人選啊？\n……不過，要是有的話你早就叫來了吧。$"="$1, do you know anyone who could help? ...Though if you did, you'd have called them already, right?"
想不到還有誰……=<size\=27>Can't think of anyone else...</size>
其實還真有……=Actually...
{{A}}……看來輪到我登場了。={{A}}... Looks like it's my time to shine.
{{A}}……是誰！？={{A}}... Who!?
{{A}}……問得好。\n雖然一言難盡……硬要說的話……={{A}}... Good question. It's hard to explain in a few words... But if I had to say...
我是……「{{A}}」。=I am... "{{A}}".
我已經知曉你們的困境了。\n現在你們身陷「深淵迷宮」裡……=I've already grasped your predicament. Right now, you're trapped in the "Abyss Labyrinth"...
而離開迷宮，就需要「{{A}}」……\n也就是我的指引。=And to escape the labyrinth, you need the guidance of the "{{A}}"... that is, me.
{{A}}，完全不知道這人在說什麼……={{A}}, I have no idea what this guy's talking about...
sr:"^話說回來，他到底是誰啊？\n(.*)你知道嗎？$"="Speaking of, who even is he? $1, do you know him?"
是誰來著……？=Who...?
我不認識=I don't know them
他是「深淵的引導者」=He is the "Abyssal Guide"

Choice 1
不是吧不是吧！\n你別這樣啊！？=No no! Don't be like this!?
Choice 2
我是{{B}}啊！高一的{{A}}！=I'm {{B}}! A first-year! {{A}}!
Choice 3
r:"^呼……不愧是與我同為「{{A}}」的，\n(.*){{B}}。$"="Ha... As expected of my fellow "{{A}}", $1-senpai."
我是高一的{{A}}……\n和{{B}}同為被命運指引之人。=I'm {{A}}, a first-year... A fellow seeker guided by fate.
是、是這樣啊……\n喔……喔唷～=Oh, I see... O-okay～
大家不是正在犯愁嗎？\n我都明白的。=You're all worried, right? I get it.
你們在等待一個，能站上舞臺中央的、\n命定的隊友……沒錯吧？=You're waiting for a destined comrade to stand at the center of the stage... Right?
好繞啊這個人……\n是說，你也想演出是嗎？=This guy's such a pain... \nSo, you want to join the play?
唔！\n就、就是這個意思。=Guh! W-well, yeah, that's the idea.
真的嗎！那你倒是直說啊！\n什麼深淵啊命運啊，你說這些誰懂啊！=Really? Then just say so! Who understands all that "abyss" and "fate" stuff!
{{B}}——！太好了！\n{{A}}對吧？太感謝你啦！={{B}}-! That's great! {{A}}, right? \nThank you so much!
沒、沒什麼……畢竟這也是命運的安排。\n區區小事，不足掛齒。=N-no problem... It's just fate's will. \nA small matter, really.
不知為何，\n高一的{{A}}願意參加演出……=For some reason, {{A}}, a first-year, is willing to join the play...
很感謝{{A}}的參與。\n但就算這樣，我們人手還是不夠……=We're grateful for {{A}}'s help, but even with him, we're still short on people...
好吧。那我再去試試，\n跟我們戲劇部的人聊聊。=Alright. I'll try talking to the drama club again.
{{A}}？他們不是說過不想幫忙嗎……={{A}}? But they already said they didn't want to help...
如果他們看過我們現在的演技，\n我想是有可能回心轉意的。=If they see how much we've improved, I think they might change their minds.
因為和你們一起演出，\n就是很開心嘛！=Because acting with you all is just so much fun!
死馬當作活馬醫吧=Give it a shot
嗯，交給我吧！\n我會好好說服他們的。=Yes, leave it to me! \nI'll convince them properly.
因為上次的事，可能讓你們印象有點差……\n但他們對演戲都很上心，人也很好。=They might've seemed rude to you... but they're actually passionate actors and good people.
哇……糟了。=Wow... Oh no.
之前提交的分鏡需要修改。\n抱歉，我先回去了……=I need to revise the submitted storyboard. \nSorry, I must go...
哇，那可是個大工程……！\n加油啊，{{A}}！=Whoa, that's a big task...! \nGood luck, {{A}}!
嗯嗯，我先告辭了……！=Mmm, I'll take my leave...!
既要當漫畫家，又要當學生，\n一定很辛苦吧……=Being both a mangaka and a student must be tough...
好了，我們繼續排練吧。\n{{A}}，你來看看這裡……=Alright, let's get back to rehearsing. {{A}}, take a look at this...
Bene！你演得很不錯啊，{{A}}。=Bene! Your acting is great, {{A}}.
畢、畢竟我可是「{{A}}」嘛……=W-well, I am a "{{A}}" after all...
好了，今天的練習到此為止。\n我們來想想服裝和小道具的問題吧。=Okay, that's it for today's practice. Let's think about the costumes and small props.
自己從頭開始剪裁很難吧。\n最好還是用類似的衣服改一下……=Making them from scratch would be hard. \nMaybe we can modify existing clothes...
打擾一下～\n{{B}}的{{A}}在嗎？=Excuse me～ Is {{A}} from {{B}} here?
{{B}}？{{A}}？={{B}}? {{A}}?
我就是{{A}}……=I am {{A}}...
啊，{{A}}！能請你來一下嗎？\n有個人在校門口吵著要找你……=Ah, {{A}}! Can you please come here for a moment? Someone is clamoring to find you at the gate...

----------
Met KOKORO
----------
我都說過了！\n未經許可，外人不能隨便進入校園！=I've told you before! Unauthorized outsiders are not allowed to enter the school grounds without permission!
必須先填寫申請表……=You must fill out an application first...
呵欠～～～=Yawn～～～
只知道遵守死規則，\n不知道靈活變通……=All you know is blindly following rigid rules, \nwith no flexibility at all...
用這種思想來教書，\n貴校的學生還真是可憐。=Teaching with this kind of mindset, \nyour students must be pitiful.
連入校目的和逗留時間也不問，\n用統一申請當藉口，合理性在哪？嗯？=Not even inquiring about our purpose or duration, just hiding behind bureaucratic formalities? How utterly absurd.
唔……當然是為了保證學生的安全！=Uh... Of course, it's to ensure student safety!
填寫申請表與學生的安全有什麼關係？=How, precisely, does scribbling on a form ensure student safety?
難道說你們學校，\n把所有外來者都一杆子打成危險分子？=Or does this institution simply presume every outsider to be a threat?
不是這個意思……=That's not what I meant...
那是什麼意思？\n我沒空聽你狡辯，請你正面回答。=Elaborate. I'll not suffer your equivocations, respond plainly.
哎呀，{{A}}～=Ara, {{A}}～
果然是您啊……\n這到底是怎麼回事？=So it is you... What exactly is going on here?
{{A}}……這位是……={{A}}... This is...?
YO！你就是{{A}}？\n不錯哦！比影片裡還要性感！=YO! You must be {{A}}? Nice! \nEven sexier than in the video!
難道您是……{{A}}？\n那位有名的製作人？=Wait... Are you... {{A}}? \nThe famous producer?
YEAH！你認識我啊？\n真開心～這麼說我還挺有名的吼？=YEAH! You know me? So happy～ \nGuess I'm pretty well-known, huh?
那當然！\n在整個業界沒人不知道您的名字……！=Of course! Your name is legendary in the entire industry...!
我是{{A}}。{{B}}！=I am {{A}}. {{B}}!
矮油～！不要這麼拘謹YO！\n老實說哦，我今天來就是專程為了你啦！=Aww～! No need to be so formal, YO! Honestly, I came here just for you today!
穿、穿得好個性啊……\n是叫{{A}}嗎？=S-stands out so much... This is {{A}}?
沒錯，這位監製過很多舞臺和電影作品……=Exactly, he's produced countless stage and film works...
竟然不認識{{A}}，\n這些門外漢就是有眼無珠啊。=To be ignorant of {{A}}, \nhow utterly plebeian.
他之前是電視臺超～厲害的導演哦。\n現在出來自己幹了……=He used to be a brilliant～legendary TV director. Now he's independent...
舞臺、電影、演唱會……\n他可是什麼都很拿手的頂級製作人呢。=Stage, cinema, concerts... \na true virtuoso of production. 
{{B}}！不要客氣啦，\n直接叫我「{{A}}」就對了！={{B}}! And don't be shy, \njust call me "{{A}}"!
那為什麼……\n{{B}}會跟{{A}}來這裡？=But why... is {{B}} here with {{A}}?
{{C}}，準備開心吧，{{A}}！\n你要當{{B}}電視劇的主演了！={{C}}, get ready to celebrate, {{A}}! {{B}} has graciously chosen you as the lead!
主演！？=Lead!?
YES！其實我現在吼，\n在策劃一個超酷超炫的網劇哦！=YES! Actually, right now, I'm planning a super cool and flashy web series!
正好在找主演，{{A}}就講說，\n有個超讚超合適的人選YO！=I was looking for a lead, and {{A}} here said there's an amazing perfect candidate, YO!
哼哼，我可是幫你好好舉薦了一把哦。\n快感謝我吧，{{A}}！=Hmph, I did go out of my way to endorse you, you know. You'd best be grateful, {{A}}!
{{A}}，你是被「有毒父母」養大的吧？={{A}}, you were raised by "toxic parents", right?
阿……？=Huh...?
這次要拍的電視劇呀，\n就是以超熱門的「有毒父母」為主題的YO！=This drama we're making, is all about the super hot topic of "toxic parents", YO!
家庭的陰暗面，\n簡直是最刺激的娛樂有沒有！=The dark side of family, the most thrilling entertainment!
這傢伙……在瞎說些什麼啊……=This guy... What the hell is he saying...
如果主演又剛好是有毒父母的倖存者吼，\n到時候在網路上一定超嗨的！=And if the lead actor actually survived toxic parents, it'll be crazy viral online!
就是這麼巧哦，{{A}}剛好把你、\n這個被有毒父母養大的帥～哥介紹給我！=What a coincidence, {{A}} just introduce me to you, a handsome guy raised by toxic parents～!
我？被有毒父母養大的……？=Me? Raised by toxic parents...?
總之就是要先試拍一下啦，\n你要把這周全～部都空出來給我哦？=Anyway, we'll do a test shoot first, so clear your entire week for me, okay～?
拍攝地點已經訂好啦！不會很突然吧？\n明天一早我們直接在外景巴士上見囉！=The filming location's already booked! Not too sudden, right? We'll meet tomorrow morning on the location bus!
等、等等！\n也就是說，這一整周{{A}}都不在嗎？=W-wait! So {{A}} won't be here all week?
那可不好辦=That's a problem
馬上就是學園祭的演出了=<size\=23>The school festival performance is soon</size>
對啊！\n沒有{{A}}，我們怎麼排練啊！=Exactly! Without {{A}}, how can we rehearse!?
……舞臺？{{B}}啊，\n{{A}}現在不是沒有接工作的嘛？=...Stage? {{B}}, \nisn't {{A}} free right now?
他們說的不是工作，是學園祭啦。\n{{A}}沒必要陪他們弄這個。=They're talking about the school festival, not work. {{A}} has far better uses with his time.
YEAH！學園祭！\n超讚的有沒有！青春！告白！篝火晚會！=YEAH! School festival! So awesome! Youth! Confessions! Campfire!
反正定下這邊的工作之後，\n你也沒辦法出演{{A}}的學園祭了。=Once this job is confirmed, you won't have time for {{A}}'s school festival.
我跟你講哦，日程真的超緊超不妙的！\n計畫下個月就得哢嚓——開機囉！=Let me tell you, the schedule is crazy tight! We're scheduled to start filming next month-!
就是說這半年你都得乖乖來全職工作YO！\n其他有的沒的拜託一律取消了啦，YO！=Meaning you'll be working full-time for the next half a year, YO! Please cancel all other nonsense, YO!
半年……恐怕不行！\n接下來還有全戲呢！而且戲劇社那邊也……=Half a year... That's impossible! We have the All-Drama! And the drama club...
{{A}}能更有名的話，對社團也是雙贏吧。\n沒關係啦。=If {{A}} gains proper recognition, it will be a win-win for the club. Don't worry.
而且，你說的全戲是高中的戲劇大賽吧？\n那種活動無所謂啦。=Besides, the All-Drama is just some high school drama competition, right? Who cares about that.
當然有所謂！\n大家都為了比賽在拼命排練……=Of course I care! Everyone's been working so hard for it...
嗯，一群想靠著沾{{A}}的光、\n來贏下比賽的孩子們，真可憐……=Hmph, pitiful children, clinging to {{A}}'s brilliance like insects to light, how pathetic...
但他們要是敢多說什麼，\n我也會讓他們閉嘴的。放心啦。=But if they dare complain, I'll silence them myself. Don't worry.
你們也是哦。=You too.
他的前途不可限量，明白嗎？\n1秒鐘都不能浪費在學園祭這種玩意上呢。=His future is limitless, understand? Can't squander a single second on something as trivial as a school festival.
「這種玩意」……！="Something as trivial"...!
你們和{{A}}，\n根本就是兩個世界的人。=You and {{A}}... \nare from completely different worlds.
你們也算跟他共度了一段青春時光，\n哪怕時間很短，也該知足了吧。=Be grateful you got to spend even a little time with him, that's more than most will ever have.
你這人怎麼說話的！\n拿我們當傻子嗎，混蛋！？=How can you talk like that! You take us for fools, bastard!?
等等，{{A}}，住手！=Wait, {{A}}, stop!
你別攔我，{{A}}！=Don't stop me, {{A}}!
住手，{{A}}。=Stop, {{A}}.
……對不起，{{A}}。\n我拒絕這份工作。=...I'm sorry, {{A}}. I refuse this job.
OH……\n我能問問理由嗎？=OH... Mind telling me why?
這個排程我無法接受。\n因為我還要參加學園祭和全戲。=This schedule doesn't work for me. I still have the school festival and the All-Drama.
等等……！你在說什麼呀，{{A}}！\n高中戲劇和網劇，哪邊更重要你不知道嗎！=Wait...! What are you saying, {{A}}!? Which is more important, some high school play or a web series!
高中戲劇更重要。\n起碼對現在的我來說是這樣。=The high school play is more important. \nAt least, to me right now.
當然，我很感激這份工作邀請。\n不過……=Of course, I'm grateful for the offer. But...
對我來說，\n跟大家共同創造的高中舞臺也很重要。=To me, the stage I create with my friends in high school matters too.
用你的價值觀貶低它，\n是對我和我朋友的侮辱。=Belittling it with your own values is an insult to me and my friends.
還有，{{A}}、{{B}}，\n我要更正一下。=Also, {{A}}, {{B}}, \nI need to correct something.
我的父母才不是有毒父母。\n他們對我這個獨生子非常好，是很優秀的。=My parents are not toxic. They were wonderful to me, their only child.
真的假的～！？=For real～!?
NONONO！\n這跟你講的完全不一樣嘛，{{A}}！=NONONO! This is totally different from what you told me, {{A}}!
不……這是……！=No... That's...!
{{A}}，你醒醒。\n也許你很難承認他們是有毒父母……={{A}}, wake up. Perhaps it's hard for you to admit they were toxic...
但這件事也可以成為你的武器。\n你要把成長的不幸變成機遇！=But you can use that. \nTurn your pain into opportunity!
我會幫你改變的……\n好嗎，{{A}}？=I'll help you through it... Alright, {{A}}?
……我不知道你對我父母了解多少，\n但請不要再用自以為是的猜測來侮辱他們。=...I don't know what you think you know about my parents, but stop insulting them with your assumptions.
啊～懂啦懂啦。整個就是大誤會吧？\n是{{A}}誤會啦對吧？=Ah～ Got it, got it. Just a big misunderstanding, right? {{A}} got it wrong?
不、不是這樣的，{{A}}！=N-no, {{A}}, that's not it!
{{A}}呀～沒有證據就行動，\n可是你的壞習慣YO～？={{A}}～ Acting without evidence is a bad habit of yours, YO～?
那，這件事就當我沒講過啦！=Well, let's just pretend this never happened!
等等……{{A}}！=Wait... {{A}}!
等等，那邊是校舍！\n你去那邊幹什麼啊！=Wait, that's the school building! \nWhere are you going!
不是在準備學園祭嘛？\n我超～想感受一下青春的芬芳呀！=Isn't it the school festival prep? I super want to soak in that youthful energy～!
啊，我會填申請表的啦！\n去哪裡填？教師辦公室？=Ah, I'll fill out the form! Where do I go? \nThe faculty office?

難以置信……\n你知道自己剛才做了什麼嗎，{{A}}？=Unbelievable... Do you realize what you just did, {{A}}?
你把你自己的未來就這麼斷送了啊！=You just threw away your own future!
我很感謝您為我介紹了一份好工作。=I'm grateful you introduced me to a great opportunity.
不過，我的未來由我自己決定。\n你無權對我指手畫腳！=But my future is mine to decide. You don't get to dictate my choices!
……什麼！=...What!
請尊重他的意志=Please respect his will
關你們屁事！！=None of your business!!
{{A}}你……\n你以為，是因為誰你才有現在的人氣？={{A}}, you... Do you even realize who's responsible for your current popularity?
是誰，把你從小舞臺一步步帶到這裡的？=Who dragged you up from those pathetic little stages?
的確是托您的福，我才有如今的人氣。\n但我當初並沒有拜託過您……=I owe my current popularity to you. But I never asked for your help in the first place...
我也同樣可以毀掉你……\n你明白吧？=I can just as easily ruin you... \nYou understand that, right?
不光是你，我也可以讓你父母……\n懂嗎？=And not just you, your parents too... \nGet it?
{{B}}……{{A}}，明白就好。\n我倒要看看你的覺悟如何。={{B}}... {{A}}, you do understand. Let's see how long that resolve of yours lasts.
等你父母被毀掉的時候……\n看你還敢不敢這樣忤逆我。=Once your parents are ruined... \nwe'll see if you still dare to defy me.
{{A}}……我不想說難聽的話。\n你快趁現在向{{B}}道歉。={{A}}... I don't want to say anything harsh. You should apologize to {{B}} right now.
再這樣下去你……不，你父母也是，\n還有跟你相關的人都會遭殃的。=If this keeps up, you... no, your parents and everyone connected to you will suffer.
多此一舉，{{A}}。\n口頭道歉是沒有意義的。=Unnecessary, {{A}}. \nAn empty apology means nothing.
如果真的理解自己的立場，\n{{A}}會知道該怎麼做的……就像你一樣。=If he truly understands his position, \n{{A}} will know what to do.... Just like you.
好了，走吧。\n必須抓緊準備{{A}}父母的資料了呢。=Now, let's go. We have to hurry and gather information on {{A}}'s parents.
沒事吧？{{A}}？=Are you okay, {{A}}?
……要說沒事才是假的啊，哎。=..Honestly? No.
{{A}}沒做錯什麼=<size\=24>{{A}} didn't do anything wrong</size>
都是{{A}}的錯=<size\=29>It's all {{A}}'s fault</size>
怎麼攻擊我都沒關係，\n但是……我父母……=They can attack me all they want, \nbut... my parents...
他們都是在社會上有頭有臉的人，\n如果因為我出了什麼事……=They're respected people in society, if something happens to them because of me...
我真蠢啊……\n我明明知道與她為敵有多可怕。=I'm so stupid... I knew how dangerous it was to oppose her.
可……我就是沒忍住。=But... I just couldn't hold back.
我受不了她看不起高中戲劇……\n受不了她取笑我、戲劇部，還有大家……=I hate how she scoffs at high school theater... mocks me, the drama club, everyone...
我想和你們、這些熱愛表演的人一起……\n一起站在學園祭的舞臺上……！=I wanna stand on that festival stage with you guys... people who burn for acting just like I do...!
唔……剛剛的是……=Hmm... That was...
……總之，我先去跟爸爸打個電話。\n得想想辦法才行……=...Anyway, I need to call my dad first. \nI have to figure something out...
另外……我可能沒辦法在學園祭演出了。\n抱歉啊，明明都一路走過來了。=Also... I might have to drop out of the festival performance. Sorry, even after coming this far.
{{B}}！為什麼啊，{{A}}！={{B}}! Why, {{A}}!
那個人說要毀掉誰，就真的會說到做到。\n無論對方是藝人，還是普通人……=When that woman says she'll ruin someone, she means it. Whether it's a celebrity or an ordinary person...
所以如果我繼續參加，\n你們、還有{{A}}，都會有麻煩的。=So if I keep participating, you, and {{A}}, will be in danger.
不用顧慮我們！=Don't worry about us!
不會造成麻煩的！=No trouble at all!
對啊！\n而且我們可以自己保護自己！=Yeah! And we can protect ourselves!
我們想要跟{{A}}一起演出！=We want to perform with you, {{A}}!
你們能這麼說，我很開心。謝啦。\n不過……=I'm glad you feel that way. Thanks. But...
她不是普通的對手……\n就像{{A}}也不敢跟她作對一樣……=She's not an ordinary enemy... Even {{A}} wouldn't dare oppose her...
話說回來……\n剛才跟{{A}}一起的那位男性……=Speaking of which... That man who was with {{A}} earlier...
他也是{{A}}的朋友嗎？\n好像你還知道他的名字……=Is he also a friend of yours, Ikenami-kun? \nYou seemed to know his name...
嗯，那個人是……以前的熟人。=Yes, that guy is... an old acquaintance.
總之我先給我爸打個電話。\n你們先回體育館吧。=Anyway, I'll call my dad first. \nYou all head back to the gym.
{{A}}要是真的放棄了，\n那可怎麼辦啊……=If {{A}} really gives up, then what are we going to do?
還有他父母的事情。\n{{A}}是在用造謠來威脅他！=And about his parents. \n{{A}} is threatening him with slander!
唔……吾感覺，\n{{A}}剛剛復甦的慾望好像又被奪走了。=Hmm... I sense that {{A}}'s newly awakened desires are being stolen from him again.
現在馬上讓{{A}}=<size\=25>Have to {{A}}</size>
說服{{A}}不要放棄=<size\=25>Convince {{A}} not to give up</size>

Choice 1
對！這樣一來，\n也不用擔心{{A}}的慾望被繼續奪走了！=Right! That way, {{A}}'s desires won't keep getting stolen!
而且還可以保護{{A}}的家人！=And this can protect {{A}}'s family too!
Choice 2
與其這樣，\n不如現在就去{{B}}，讓{{A}}吧！=Rather than waiting, let's head to the {{B}} now and {{A}}!
這樣一來，\n我們就可以保護{{A}}和他的家人了！=That way, we can protect {{A}} and his family!
說得對……\n就算有陰影擋住入口，我們也必須前進了。=You're right... Even if the Shadows are blocking the entrance, we have to push forward.
走吧，現在就去{{A}}……=Let's go to {{A}} now...

{{C}}？{{C}}？？{{B}}！？\n等等，誰啊！？是誰點了{{A}}！={{C}}? {{C}}?? {{B}}!? Wait, who!? \nWho started the {{A}}!
喂，吾強調過多少次了！\n禁止從{{A}}站以外的地方潛入啊！=Hey, how many times do I have to say it! No infiltrating from anywhere but {{A}} Station!
sr:"^不是我啊！是(.*)嗎！？$"="Wasn't me! Was it $1?"
不是不是=No no
WIND？=Wind?
那，難道說是WIND？=Then, was it Wind?
才不是呢！=No way!
{{B}}？\n那到底是誰點了{{A}}啊？={{B}}? Then who started the {{A}}?
……等等，大家看那邊！=...Wait, everyone, look over there!
{{A}}？怎麼沒有訊號……？={{A}}? Why's there no signal...?
{{A}}……這裡是哪兒……={{A}}... Where is this...
{{A}}，你們是誰啊！？={{A}}, who are you!?
{{C}}、這個聲音是……\n{{B}}和{{A}}？={{C}}, that voice... {{B}} and {{A}}?
sr:"^那，難道那邊的是(.*)……？\n然後你是(.*)？$"="Then, that's $1...? And you're $2?"
你們這是穿的什麼啊！？\n也不是演出服吧，到底是……=What are you wearing!? These aren't stage costumes, right? What's going on...
{{A}}，搞不懂，這是怎麼了。\n發生了什麼？還有那邊那個玩偶是誰啊？={{A}}, I don't get it. What's going on? \nAnd who's that mascot?
誰是玩偶啊！你哪怕說{{A}}都比……\n算了，煩死了！=Who are you calling a mascot! Even {{A}} would be... Whatever, I'm so annoyed!
不過為何連{{A}}都會來{{B}}……=But why is {{A}} in the {{B}} too...
那個，該怎麼跟你解釋呢？\n雖然這是機密，但其實我們是…=Um, how to explain this...? \nIt's a secret, but we're actually...
{{B}}……！？\n{{A}}，快來我們身後！={{B}}...!? {{A}}, get behind us, now!
這個大傢伙是什麼東西！？\n到底發生了什麼啊？=What is that thing!? What's happening?!
{{B}}……\n吾等不能邊帶著{{A}}邊戰鬥……！={{B}}... We can't fight and protect {{A}} at the same time...!
{{A}}！？\n這車又是從哪兒冒出來的啊！={{A}}!? Where'd this car even come from!
沒時間解釋了，快上車！！=No time, just get in!!
各位，戰略性撤退！\n從這裡先逃出去吧！=Everyone, tactical retreat! Let's escape for now!
車竟然……說話了！？=The car just... talked!?
{{A}}，你現在一定有很多疑問，\n但還請無條件配合我們。={{A}}, I know this makes no sense to you, but just do as we say for now.
請相信我們=Please trust us
一定會保護好你的=I will protect you
sr:"^(.*)……\n好，我知道了。$"="$1... Okay, I understand."
總之我會跟著你們的。\n過後可要好好解釋清楚啊！=I'll follow you. But you owe me an explanation later!

可惡，怎麼甩不掉它……\n再跑快點兒，CATTLE！=Damn it, it's still on us...! Go faster, Cattle!
不用你說吾也知道！\n但人太多了速度上不來……再這樣下去……=I know! I can't speed up with this many people... At this rate...
啊，你們看！\n那邊不就是{{A}}入口嗎？=Ah, look! Isn't that the entrance to {{A}}?
{{A}}的……{{B}}？={{A}}'s... {{B}}?
WONDER，先進{{A}}裡吧！\n那裡一定有能躲的地方！=Wonder, let's enter the {{A}}! \nThere must be a place to hide!
先去{{A}}躲避一下！=Hide in the {{A}}!
吾知道了！\n大家坐好，吾要直接衝進去了！=I got it! Everyone, sit tight, I'm going in!

呼……\n看來{{B}}不會追到{{A}}裡面呢。=Phew... Looks like {{B}} won't follow us into the {{A}}.
不過它的氣息還在附近。\n現在最好不要離開{{A}}區域。=But its presence is still nearby. It would be best to not leave the {{A}} yet.
那個……現在算暫時安全了嗎？\n我想請你們說明一下情況……=So... are we safe for now? \nI would like you to explain...
啊，對啊。\n其實是這樣的……=Ah, right. \nActually...
{{A}}……{{B}}，還有陰影……\n所以，你們現在才穿著{{C}}啊……={{A}}... {{B}}, and Shadow... So that's why you're all in {{C}}...
我覺得你肯定不信吧……=I know it's hard to believe...
不，我相信你們。\n畢竟我能看出來，這可不是特攝什麼的。=No, I believe you. Honestly, it's obvious this isn't some staged production.
所以，你們穿梭在現實與{{A}}之間，\n跟剛才那種怪物戰鬥……=So, you travel between the real world and the {{A}}, fighting those monsters...
沒錯，用這個{{A}}。=Yes, using this {{A}}.
嗯？總覺得見過這個圖示……=Huh? I think I've seen this icon...
對了！剛才我給爸爸打電話，雖然沒打通，\n但好像看到一個陌生的圖示……=Right! Just now, when I couldn't call my dad earlier, I saw this weird icon I didn't recognize...
果然啊……！\n這跟你們的圖示是一樣的吧？=Knew it...! It's the same icon as yours?
{{A}}的手機裡也有導航？={{A}} got the Nav too?
莫非突然來到{{A}}是因為……=<size\=26>We're suddenly in the {{A}} because...</size>
{{C}}還真是！\n{{A}}的手機裡也有{{B}}！={{C}} For real! {{A}}'s phone also have the {{B}}!
那剛才大家突然進入{{A}}……=So maybe the reason we suddenly entered the {{A}} was...
啊，是不是{{A}}不小心點了圖示啊？=Ah, did {{A}} accidentally tapped on the icon?
{{A}}、有嗎……？\n我不記得我點過。={{A}}, did I...? I don't remember.
那麼，{{A}}，接下來要怎麼辦呢？\n如果出去，剛才那傢伙就會追過來吧？=Then, um, what now? If we go back out, that thing will probably chase us?
沒錯，至少在{{B}}的氣息消失之前，\n我們都不能離開{{A}}……=Right. Until the {{B}}'s presence vanishes, \nwe can't leave the {{A}}...
好。那麼……\n看來只能進那棟很顯眼的大樓了吧？=Right. Then... I'm guessing we should enter that flashy building, right?
唔……\n雖然帶著{{A}}探索{{B}}會有風險……=Hmm... Alright bringing {{A}} to {{B}} exploration is risky...
但比起去外面，\n{{A}}裡才有藏身之處呢。=It's safer than being outside, there are hiding spots in the {{A}}.
那些人不人鬼不鬼的傢伙是誰啊……\n而且好像提到了「{{A}}」？=What are those weird looking guys... They kept mentioning "{{A}}"?
啊，抱歉。本來想晚點再跟你解釋的。\n你把這裡當作{{A}}的內心世界吧。=Ah, sorry. I was going to explain this to you later. You can think of this as {{A}}'s inner world.
{{A}}的……內心世界？={{A}}'s... inner world?
沒錯，是以{{A}}扭曲的慾望為核心，\n形成的認知{{C}}……也就是「{{B}}」。=That's right, this is a cognitive place formed with {{A}}'s distorted desires at its core... a "{{B}}".
只要奪走隱藏在這裡的{{B}}，\n我們就能讓{{A}}。=By stealing the {{B}} hidden here, we can {{A}}.
阿？{{A}}……？=Huh? {{A}}...?
那個{{A}}，會變成正常人？\n這不可能吧……=That {{A}}, will become a normal person? That's impossible...
你這麼想也不奇怪啦，但實際上，\n我們已經讓前棒球選手{{A}}……=You might think so, but actually, we already did that to the former baseball player {{A}}...
還有{{A}}、{{B}}都{{C}}了哦。=We also made {{A}} and {{B}} have a {{C}}.
啊～我記得，\n美食藝人{{A}}在新聞發佈會上大哭……=Ah～ I remember, the gourmet celebrity {{A}} broke down at that press conference...
好像從那時起，就出現了「怪盜」這個詞。\n就是因為你們讓他們{{A}}了吧？=That's when the "Phantom Thieves" rumors started. Was that because you guys changed their hearts?
我們也會讓{{A}}的=<size\=26>We will {{A}}</size>
難以置信……\n真是完全想像不到。=I can't believe it... \nThere's just no way I can believe that.
嗯，但信不信由你，這是事實。=Hmm, there's no helping it. But whether you believe it or not, that's the truth.
不過，接下來該怎麼辦呢？\n那些傢伙肯定不會讓我們進去的吧？=But, what's next? Those guys are blocking our way again.
而且，上次找到的另一個區域是死路。=However, the other area we explored last time was a dead end.
要是在那裡被襲擊，就真的無處可逃了。\n吾不贊成去那邊。=There is no escape if we get ambushed. I don't agree with going there.
是啊，該怎麼辦呢……=Right, then what should we do...
如果想見{{A}}的話，\n那就變成帥哥後再來吧！=If you want an audience with {{A}}, come back when you're handsome!
現在有帥哥了吧……=<size\=26>There's someone handsome...</size>
{{A}}在的話是不是……={{A}} is here...
啊，你是說如果和{{A}}在一起，\n那些陰影就會讓我們通過？=Ah, you are saying if we go with {{A}}, those Shadows will let us pass?
他確實很帥……\n但這真的行得通嗎？=He's certainly handsome... \nBut will this really work?
唔……從{{B}}現實中的狀態來看，\n她很可能將{{A}}認知為「特殊的存在」……=Hmm... Given {{B}}'s behaviors in reality, it's highly likely she might perceive {{A}} as a "special person"...
不能這麼做。\n不能讓{{A}}去當誘餌。=We can't do this. \nWe can't let {{A}} be the bait.
我不介意。=I don't mind.
雖然我不清楚原委，\n但如果能幫上忙，就讓我去吧。=I may not know the details, \nbut if I can help, let me do it.
我和那些奇怪的人談談就行嗎？=All I have to do is talk to those strange people, right?
跟我們一起吧=Come with us
我們會保護你的=We'll protect you
跟著你們就行，對吧？\n明白，那更沒問題了。=Just follow you guys, right? \nGot it, no problem then.
不過，真進到塔裡的話可能會更危險哦，\n說不定會遇到更強悍的陰影。=But if we really go inside the tower, it might get even more dangerous. We could run into stronger Shadows.
就算這樣也要試試=<size\=30>Even so, we have to try</size>
不想錯失良機=<size\=29>Can't miss the opportunity</size>
還是放棄吧……=Maybe give up...

Choice 1
好，隊長都這麼說了，我也贊成！=Alright, if the leader says so, I agree too!
我來負責保護{{A}}！就交給我吧！=I'll take responsibility for protecting {{A}}! \nLeave it to me!
Choice 2
是啊，不管怎樣，\n不進去怎麼讓{{A}}呢？=Yeah, no matter what, how else can we {{A}} if we don't go in?
Choice 3
你在怕什麼呀。\n我不都說了沒關係嘛？=What are you afraid of? Didn't I say it's fine?
我相信無論發生什麼，\n你們都會保護我的。=I trust that no matter what happens, you'll all protect me.
喂，我來負責保護{{A}}！就交給我吧！=Hey, I'll take responsibility for protecting {{A}}! Leave it to me!
好吧。吾也聽從隊長的決定。=Alright. I'll follow the leader's decision too.
那走吧！\n如果不讓我們進去，就打倒他們！=Then let's go! If they don't let us in, \nwe'll just take them down!
……哦對了，{{A}}。\n在這裡要叫我SOY啊。=...Oh, right, {{A}}. Here, you have to call me Soy.
我是CLOSER！=I am Closer!
請叫我WIND。=Please call me Wind.
吾是CATTLE。\n這傢伙是WONDER。=I'm Cattle.\nThis guy is Wonder.
我是WONDER，{{A}}=<size\=25>I'm Wonder. {{A}}</size>
很像怪盜吧？=Like Phantom Thieves?
原來如此，在{{A}}要用代號相稱啊。=I see, you use code names in the {{A}}.
Bene。那我和你們一起。\n拜託了，WONDER。=Bene, then I'll join you. Please, Wonder.

Palace 5 Exploration Part 2
----------
這裡只能通往死路。\n還是前往正面的入口吧。=This path only leads to a dead end. Let's head to the main entrance instead.
只能一試了……=Have no choice but to try...
哦呀，那邊的小哥……！=Oh my, that guy over there...!
好棒的帥哥……！\n請進去吧！=What a handsome man...! \nPlease, go right in!
可以進去嗎？\n不會是想趁機偷襲我們吧。=Are we really allowed in? You're not planning to ambush us, are you?
哪裡敢！\n這裡的規定就是要對帥哥畢恭畢敬哦！=How could we dare! The rule here is to treat handsome men with the utmost respect!
那麼，帥哥的各位同伴們也請進吧。=In that case, the handsome one's companions may enter as well.
好厲害，真的給過了啊。=Amazing, they actually let us through.
果然是看「臉」放人啊……=So they really judge people based on "looks"...
這是……{{A}}的認知對吧？\n唔，總覺得好噁心……=This must be... {{A}}'s cognition, right? Ugh, it feels kinda gross...
不過既然達到目的了那就無所謂啦。\n總之我們進去吧。=But since it worked, I guess it doesn't matter. Anyway, let's go in.

{{A}}！\n要去上層就好好排隊啊！={{A}}! If you want to go to the top, just queue up!
{{A}}……抱歉。這是什麼情況？={{A}}... sorry.\nWhat is this situation?
大家都是好不容易才取得了『上去的資格』，\n不要在最後關頭做出格的事呀。=Everyone has finally obtained the "qualifications to go up", don't do anything out of line at the last minute.
上去的資格？=Qualifications to go up?
哦？ 你們不知道嗎？ 想到上層去，\n只有先去『覲見室』取得資格才行哦。=Oh? Didn't you know? To reach the upper level, you must first get the qualifications in the "Audience Chamber".
覲見室……又是什麼？？=Audience Chamber... What's that??
哎呀，原來是一群菜鳥啊。\n那是一個很重要的房間啦！=Oh, it turns out they are a bunch of rookies. That's a very important room!
如果想到上面去，\n就先去那邊取得資格再說吧。=If you want to go to the top, you should first get the qualifications.
看來不會簡單的讓我們通過呢。\n只能去那個『覲見室』一探究竟了。=It looks like they won't let us pass so easily. Let's investigate this "Audience Chamber".
WONDER，在附近找找\n前往深處的路吧。=Wonder, look around for a way to go deeper.

哇……這是哪兒？好震撼啊。\n而且有好多人呢。=Wow... What is this place? It's amazing. \nAnd there are so many people here.
那些不是真正的人，是認知存在。\n可以理解為{{A}}印象中的人。=Those aren't real people, they're cognitive beings. You can think of them as how {{A}} perceives them.
明明之前探索過的區域，\n都是像螞蟻一樣的陰影……=But in the areas we explored before, \nthe Shadows were all like ants...
為什麼這裡有這麼多人型認知存在啊？=Why are there so many humanoid cognitive beings here?
走近看看=Take a closer look
問問他們自己吧=Ask them

Choice 1
嗯，仔細觀察一下他們的行動吧，\n看看到底是基於什麼樣的認知。=Hmm, let's carefully observe their behavior first. We should figure out what kind of cognition they're based on.
Choice 2
唔，想弄懂他們是基於什麼樣的認知，\n確認問本人效率最高……=Well, if we want to understand their cognition, asking them directly would be the most efficient...

但這樣有可能會被{{A}}察覺。\n總之先靠近點看看情況吧。=But that might alert {{A}}. For now, let's just move closer and assess the situation.
有氣無力的認知存在=Weak Cognitive Being
我對不起這個世界，活著我很抱歉……\n我……是個沒有任何價值的人……=I've wronged this world, I'm sorry for being alive... I... am a worthless person...
{{A}}？為什麼要說這種話！？=Huh?! Why would they say such things!?
喂，CLOSER！=Hey, Closer!
啊！=Ah!
抱歉，但這個人……\n看起來也太慘了……=I'm sorry, but this person... \nthey look absolutely miserable...
你不需要同情我……\n我是個色狼，是個無恥的混蛋。=You don't need to pity me... I'm a pervert, a shameless scumbag.
色狼！？=A pervert!?
是的。多虧{{A}}揭露了我的罪，\n我才得以受到社會的制裁……=Yes. Thanks to {{A}} exposing my sins, I was rightfully punished by society...
我已經無法再回到社會……\n我只能一直在這裡懺悔下去……=I can never return to society now... All I can do is stay here and repent forever...
色狼啊……\n那確實不可原諒……=A pervert, huh... Yeah, that's unforgivable...
等一下。\n我好像見過這個人。=Wait. I think I've seen this person before.
我忘了名字，應該是家出版社的副社長。\n好像跟{{A}}是競爭對手吧……=I don't remember his name, but he was a deputy editor at some publishing company. Probably a competitor to {{A}}...
莫非，這是……！=Could it be, this is...!
女性認知存在=Female Cognitive Being
我明明是偶像，卻和經紀人搞婚外情。\n我背叛了我的粉絲……=I was an idol, but I had an affair with my manager. I betrayed my fans...
我們被{{A}}揭發了。\n一切都真相大白了。={{A}} exposed us. \nThe whole truth came to light.
男性認知存在=Male Cognitive Being
我就是那個對她出手的變態經紀人。=I was the disgusting manager who took advantage of her.
我已經不能回歸職場和家庭了……=I can never go back to my job or my family now...
我會在這裡跟她一起不斷反省的……\n十分感謝揭發我們的{{A}}。=I'll stay here and reflect with her forever... I'm so grateful to {{A}} for revealing our sins...
看來這裡的人都是……=So the people here are all...
是被{{A}}寫成報導、爆出醜聞的人，\n所形成的認知存在吧。=These are the cognitive beings formed from people whom {{A}} exposed in scandalous articles.
也就是說，他們都是受害者吧……！=In other words, they're all victims...!
剛才那位女性和經紀人，我有印象呢。=I remember that woman and her manager.
好像就是因為出軌報導，\n那個女孩最後退出了演藝圈。=It's true that she retired from the industry after the affair was reported.
……但在業界，一直有人說那是謠言。=...But in the industry, there were always rumors that it was just fabrication.
謠言！？=Fabrication!?
嗯。她跟經紀人只是正常的工作關係，\n而且自己本來就有男朋友。=Yes. She and her manager were just in a normal professional relationship, and she already had a boyfriend.
但她男朋友……\n似乎是位{{A}}欣賞的歌手……=But her boyfriend... was apparently a singer that {{A}} admired...
{{B}}？\n所以就出於{{A}}陷害了那個偶像！？={{B}}? So she framed that idol out of jealousy!?
好幾個認識她的演員朋友都這麼說。\n雖然也不知道真假……=Several of her actor friends said so. \nThough we can't be sure if it's true...
現在我覺得，\n{{A}}也許真的幹得出來這種事。=At this point, \nI wouldn't put it past {{A}}.
太過分了吧……=That's terrible...
換句話說，這裡的人都是被{{A}}陷害、\n被社會所抹殺的人。=In other words, the people were framed by {{A}} and socially erased.
而且他們嘴裡都是對{{A}}的感恩戴德。\n這意味著……=And yet, they're all spouting gratitude toward {{A}}. That means...
對{{A}}而言「制裁他們」不但理所應當，\n反而認為是「拯救」了他們。=To {{A}}, "punishing them" isn't just justified, she genuinely believes she's "saving" them.
這認知真是扭曲到極限了。\n為了私慾毀掉他人，還認為這是正義……=This cognition is distorted to the extreme. Destroying lives for selfish gain and calling it justice...
不可饒恕……=Unforgivable...
她到底毀了多少人的人生……=How many lives has she ruined...
是啊，這場面的確令人作嘔。\n但吾等必須繼續前進了。=Indeed, this is sickening to witness. \nBut we must press on.

唔……！\n那是……在做什麼？=Hmm…! \nWhat is that... doing?
剛才的那個陰影，\n是怎麼開的門呀？=How did the shadow just now open the door?
應該和牆上的結晶有關。=It should be related to the crystal on the wall.
但和迄今為止遇到的結晶不同，\n似乎沒有辦法移動。=But unlike the crystals encountered so far, it seems that there is no way to move.
嗯……剛才的陰影似乎做了些奇妙的舉動\n把結晶給啟動了……=Hmm... the shadow just now seemed to have done something strange and activated the crystal...
嗯，『{{A}}』地一下那樣……\n要模仿它的動作嗎？=Yes, they did a "{{A}}"... \nWant to imitate its actions?
目前的線索太少了。\n先跟上去看看吧。=There are too few clues at the moment. \nLet's follow and see first.
剛才的陰影應該就在門後！\nWONDER，準備好了嗎？=The shadow just now should be behind the door! Wonder, are you ready?
那些紅兵蟻是在幹什麼……？\n好像在使用什麼武器……=What are those red soldier ants doing...? \nIt seems like they are using some weapon...
你們……是入侵者嗎！？\n抓住他們！=Are you... intruders!?\nCatch them!
幹得不錯，WONDER！=Good job, Wonder!
剛才是怎麼回事？\n那個東西直接進到手槍裡了！？=What happened just now? \nThat thing went straight into the gun!?
嗯……似乎是那種結晶的能量\n被灌注到WONDER的武器裡了……=Hmm... it seems that the energy of the crystals has been infused into Wonder's weapon...
現在是不是\n也可以做到剛才的『那個』了？=Maybe you can do "that" now?
啊，你是指剛才的陰影\n『{{A}}』的那一下吧！=Ah, you mean that “{{A}}”!
這種能量……\n該說是螞蟻的費洛蒙一樣的東西嗎。=This energy... is it something like ant pheromones?
總之，這樣應該就能啟動牆壁上的結晶了。=Anyway, this should be able to activate the crystals on the wall.
成功了！\nWONDER，旁邊還有一個結晶！=Success! Wonder, there is another crystal next to it!
啊……聽到剛才的聲音了嗎？\n可能是哪裡的門開了！=Ah...did you hear that sound just now? \nMaybe a door somewhere is open!
這個辦法果然可行。\n我們回剛才的房間確認一下吧。=This method really works. \nLet's go back to the room and check.
唔……看來沒有子彈了。=Hmm... looks like there's no ammo left.

不錯！獲得貧民窟的全部地圖了！=Nice!\nWe got the full slum map now!
唔啊，感覺要走的路還很長？\n我們是要去哪裡來著？=Hmm, it feels like there is still a long way to go? Where are we going?
現在準備前往的是，\n地圖這裡的『覲見室』。=Now we are going to the "Audience Chamber" here on the map.
到處都有陰影的氣息。\n全員，一邊警戒周圍一邊前進吧。=There are Shadows everywhere. Everyone, move forward while keeping an eye on your surroundings.

好耶！WONDER，門開了哦！=Yay! Wonder, the door is open!
WONDER，前方有強敵的氣息！\n準備好了嗎？=Wonder, there is a presence of a strong enemy ahead! Ready?
那位是……？=That is...?
大膽入侵者，竟敢擅闖禁地！=Bold intruders, you are trespassing!
這傢伙看上去很強啊……！\n好，放馬過來吧！=This guy looks strong...! \nAlright, bring it!

嗯，怎麼了？{{A}}。=Hm, what's wrong? {{A}}.
沒……不會吧。\n可是……=No way... It can't be. But...
等我一下！=Wait!
那個，抱歉打擾一下！=Excuse me, sorry to bother you!
美麗的女性=Beautiful Women
果然是……媽媽！！=It really is... Mom!!
{{B}}那是{{A}}的媽媽！？={{B}} That's {{A}}s mom!?
是媽媽年輕的時候。那時我還小……=Yeah, from when she was younger. \nWhen I was little...
為什麼媽媽會在這種地方……\n而且為什麼穿成這樣子……=Why is mom in a place like this...?\nAnd why is she dressed like that...?
母親的認知存在=Cognitive Mother
請不要管我……讓我一個人待著……=Please... just leave me alone...
我是個不僅出軌、\n還拋棄了孩子和丈夫的惡毒女人……=I'm a vile woman who cheated and abandoned my child and husband...
阿……！？=Huh...!?
{{A}}揭露了我的罪行，\n所以我逃回了自己的國家。={{A}} exposed my sins, \nso I fled back to my home country.
我的丈夫和兒子才終於……\n得以擺脫我這個該死的女人。=Only then could my husband and son... finally be free of a wretch like me.
我對{{A}}感激不盡……=I am very grateful to {{A}}...
你、你在說什麼啊，媽媽！=Wh-what are you saying, mom!
媽媽你沒出軌！\n而且你也沒有拋棄我、沒離開爸爸啊！=You never cheated! And you didn't abandon me or dad either!
不，我就是個不僅出軌、\n還拋棄了丈夫和兒子的惡毒女人……=No, I'm a vile woman who cheated and abandoned my child and husband...
是{{A}}她……\n讓我的家人得到了解脫……=It was {{A}} who... \nfreed them from me...
難道……\n寫當初那篇報導的人就是……！=Don't tell me... The one who wrote that article back then was...!
沒事吧，{{A}}？=Are you okay, {{A}}?

Choice 1
原來……！\n原來是這麼一回事！=I see...! So that's what happened!
Choice 2
啊、嗯……我沒事。\n原來是這樣，原來是這麼回事啊……=Ah... yeah, I'm fine. It all makes sense now...
你明白什麼了，{{A}}？=What did you figure out, {{A}}?
……當初，媽媽是因為一篇醜聞，\n才無法繼續留在日本的。=...Back then, my mom couldn't stay in Japan anymore because of a scandal.
我的父母都是演員，\n他們兩個現在也都還在工作。=Both of my parents are actors, \nthey're still active today.
父親主攻舞臺劇，而母親只演義大利電影。\n所以大家應該不認識……=My dad is mainly on stage and my mom has only appeared in Italian films, so you probably don't know them...
那也就是說，{{A}}是演員世家？\n哇……星二代！=Wait, so {{A}} comes from a family of actors? Wow... a celebrity child!
……沒那麼厲害啦。=...It's not that impressive.
不過，我之所以走演員這條路，\n也是因為父母的影響吧。=But I guess the reason I became an actor was because of them.
小時候，即使只是給我讀繪本，\n他們也會分角色來飾演。=When I was little, even when they just read me picture books, they'd act out the different roles.
最後我也演了起來，一家人一起扮家家酒。\n差不多就是這種家庭環境……=Eventually, I started joining in too. it was like our whole family was playing pretend together...
全家人一起表演嗎……\n好溫馨啊。=A play for the whole family... \nThat sounds so warm.
真是好棒的父母啊！=Your parents are amazing!
嗯，雖然記憶有些模糊……\n但那的確是段很幸福、很快樂的時光。=Yeah, though my memories are a bit fuzzy... \nIt really was a happy, joyful time.
但是有一天……\n一篇報導毀掉了一切。=But one day... \na single article destroyed everything.
日本的醜聞雜誌上，\n刊登了媽媽出軌的文章。=A Japanese scandal magazine published a story claiming my mom was having an affair.
那是一篇完全毫無根據的報導，\n我爸媽都立即否認了。=It was completely baseless, both my parents denied it immediately.
實際上，\n她也只是被拍到和電影製片人吃飯而已。=In reality, she was just photographed having dinner with a film producer.
那不應該立刻就澄清了嗎……？=Shouldn't that have been cleared up instantly...?
那個雜誌就像在追著她咬一樣，\n又接連爆出了更多的醜聞。=But that magazine kept hounding her, publishing more and more fabricated scandals.
說什麼跟年輕演員們偷情、\n拋下兒子在國外過著奢侈的生活……=They claimed she was secretly seeing younger actors, that she abandoned me to live lavishly abroad...
當然，那也全都是謠言。\n只是在國外與年輕演員正常拍攝罷了。=Of course, none of it was true. She was just working on films overseas with those actors.
但俗話說：三人成虎。\n經過媒體的多次報導……人們逐漸相信了。=As the saying goes, no smoke without fire. After many media reports... people bought into it.
另外，我爸爸也是個很受女性歡迎的演員，\n也許這也成了被抨擊的黑點。=Plus, my dad was a popular actor with women, so maybe that made him an easy target too.
其他媒體也都爭相開始報導……\n最終，媽媽在日本的形象完全崩塌了。=Other media followed suit... until mom's reputation in Japan was destroyed.
怎麼這樣……=How...
好過分啊……=That's terrible...
造謠造到這種地步……=To slander this far...
很遺憾，也許這就是人性……\n有名的人越不幸，大眾就越興奮狂熱……=Sadly, maybe that's human nature... The more famous someone is, the more the public enjoys seeing them fall...
人們如果失去正常的判斷能力，\n只會演變成集體正義的徹底失控……=When people stop thinking critically, it just becomes mob justice...
也許……你們是對的。\n當然，那時我爸爸一直在抗議……=Maybe... you're right. Of course, my dad protested at the time too...
最後連他自己都被諷刺成……\n「自欺欺人的傢伙」「綠帽男」……=Even he himself was ridiculed as... "delusional," and "a cuckold"...
好過分……=That's terrible...
結果，媽媽得了心病，回了老家義大利。=In the end, mom's heart grew unwell, and she had to return to her hometown in Italy.
所以你們才分開住了啊……=So that's why you lived apart...
我爸爸也考慮過，\n把他的工作重心轉移到義大利……=My dad considered moving his career to Italy too...
但如果輕率地搬過去的話，\n他反而可能會被進一步被批評成懦夫、逃兵。=But if he did that recklessly, people would've just criticized him as a coward and a deserter.
怎麼會這樣……！=No way...!
雖然記不太清了，\n但我媽媽每天都哭著求我和爸爸……=I don't remember it well, but my mom kept begging me and my dad through tears...
「我無法忍受我愛的人受到傷害，\n希望你們繼續生活在熟悉的日本……」="I cannot bear harm coming to those I love... Please, live on in Japan, your home."
「我一個人離開就可以了。」="I'll be the one to leave."
你媽媽是犧牲了自己，\n努力來保護家人呢……=Your mom sacrificed herself to protect her family...
爸爸也勸過媽媽，但她心意已決……\n說這樣對年幼的我也更好……=Dad tried to talk her out of it, but she refused... saying it would be better for me.
所以從我小時候開始，\n媽媽就一直不在家了。=So ever since I was little, \nmy mom was never home.
{{A}}……還有{{A}}的爸爸媽媽都好可憐。\n明明什麼壞事也沒做……！={{A}}... and your parents have all suffered so much, even though you did nothing wrong...!
{{A}}，的確。\n我小時候還真是挺孤單的。={{A}}, yes. I was pretty lonely as a kid.
不過我們經常電話聯繫，\n每年也能見上兩次面。=But we talked on the phone a lot, and I got to see her twice a year.
對我們家來說，\n應該就這樣也算挺安定的。=For our family, this lifestyle is probably the stable one.
你不想跟爸媽一起住嗎？=<size\=22>Don't you want to live with your parents?</size>
你現在也還會感到孤單吧？=Do you still feel lonely now?
到這個年齡，已經不會啦。\n差不多也該獨自生活了吧？=At this age, not really. It's about time I started living on my own anyway.
而且……我可不想看到我媽媽掉眼淚啊。=And... I couldn't bear to see my mom cry.
她到現在也還會說，\n「沒法陪你一起生活，對不起」呢。=Even now, she still says, "I'm sorry I couldn't be there to raise you".
明明自己才是被傷得最深的受害者……=Even though she was the one who suffered the most...
不過……這是認知存在對吧？\n媽媽會出現在這裡，也就意味著……=But... this is just a cognitive being, right? If mom's appearing here, that means...
寫那篇報導、誣陷我媽媽的人，\n就是{{A}}吧？=The one who wrote that article and framed her, was {{A}}?
肯定是這樣=Definitely
原來{{A}}一家也是受害者=<size\=30>{{A}}'s family is also a victim</size>
……我也是現在才知道。=...I only just realized it now.
那時我還太小了，\n而且爸爸也把當時的報導都扔了。=I was too young back then, and my dad threw out all the articles.
我從來沒有細想過……\n它們到底是誰寫的。=I never really thought about... \nwho wrote it.
唔，而且如果是十幾年前，\n{{A}}可能也還是個默默無聞的小記者。=Hmm, and if it was over a decade ago, {{A}} was probably still an unknown reporter.
從那時起就透過這種手段一路往上爬，\n到現在成了主編……一切都說得通了。=She risen to fame through these methods, and is now the editor-in-chief... It all makes sense now.
雖然我一直在想，\n陷害媽媽的一定是和{{A}}一樣的壞人……=Deep down, I thought the reporter who framed mom was probably the same kind of person as {{A}}...
可誰能想到就是她本人！=But who would've thought it was her herself!
而且，明明就是她害了媽媽，\n還這麼肉麻地挑逗她兒子！？這不正常！=And after what she did to my mom... she had the nerve to flirt with her son!? That's insane!
可惡、可惡啊！！=Damn it, damn it all!!
……你們說過，\n可以讓{{A}}對吧？=...You said, it's possible to {{A}}, right?
一定要{{A}}=<size\=28>Have to {{A}}</size>
那能不能也帶我一起。=Then let me come with you.
我想親眼見證，那個女人{{A}}。=I want to see that woman's change of heart with my own eyes.
雖然想帶你一起去……=<size\=30>Although I want to take you...</size>
這有點困難……=This is a bit difficult...
唔，{{A}}裡到處是陰影，十分危險。\n這次也是沒辦法才讓你一起行動的。=Hmm, the {{A}} is filled with dangerous Shadows. We had no choice but to bring you along this time.
而且，如果在這裡丟了性命的話……\n現實世界中的你也會死亡。=And if you die here... you'll die in the real world too.
當然，對吾等也一樣……=Of course, the same goes for us..
但吾等有{{C}}和{{B}}作為保護，\n所以才能對抗{{A}}。=But we have our {{C}} and {{B}} as protection, so we can fight against the {{A}}.
但我們要一邊保護毫無防備的你，\n一邊戰鬥，風險會非常大。=Fighting while also protecting you who are defenseless would be way too risky.
也是啊……抱歉……=Yes... Sorry...
我們一定會讓{{B}}的！\n放心交給我們吧，{{A}}！=We'll definitely {{B}}! Leave it to us, {{A}}!
嗯，謝謝你們。=Hmm. Thank you.
那這個認知存在的「媽媽」……\n只能讓她繼續在這裡嗎？=Then this cognitive "mom"... \nDo we just leave her here?
對，認知存在跟現實中的人沒有任何關係。\n這只不過是{{A}}心中的樣子罷了。=Yes. Cognitive beings have no connection to real people. This is just how {{A}} perceives her.
吾知道這很難受，但是請你理性看待。=I know it's hard, but please be rational.
好，我知道了。=Okay. I understand.
媽媽，總有一天……\n我絕對會讓{{A}}本人跟你道歉的……=Mom, someday... I'll make {{A}} apologize to you herself...

附近都被荊棘給擋住了……！=The area around is blocked by thorns...!
WONDER，找找還有沒有其他的路吧。=Wonder, let's other paths.
這個顏色……和之前的費洛蒙不太一樣呢。=This color... is a bit different from the previous pheromones.
我感受到一股非常不安的氣息……\n不，甚至可以說有點兇暴。=I sensed a very uneasy presence... No, even a bit violent.
嗯……這個顏色的費洛蒙\n也許對荊棘會有效果……=Hmm... pheromones of this color might be effective against thorns...
WONDER，不妨試試看吧！=Wonder, why not give it a try!
好！附近的門全部開啟了！=Yeah! All the nearby doors are open!
看來這種新的費洛蒙\n也能用來啟動結晶。=Seems like this new pheromone can also be used to activate crystals.
大家快看那邊。\n有一處結晶平臺。=Everybody, look over there. \nThere is a crystal platform.
真的{{A}}！　但是不是太窄了？\n而且還有那麼多荊棘……=Really! But isn't that too narrow? And there are so many thorns...
是啊。不過只要把荊棘破壞，\n應該就能利用了。=Yes. But as long as we destroy the thorns, we should be able to use them.
嗯。先用橙色的費洛蒙\n破壞荊棘吧。WONDER，交給你了。=Um. Let's use the orange pheromones to destroy the thorns. Wonder, it's up to you.
唔，不行啊……看來是失敗了。=Hmm, no... It's not working.
WONDER，門後有強大的陰影\n解除螞蟻形態再來吧！=Wonder, there's a powerful Shadow behind the door, remove ant form first!
入侵者，入侵者！=Intruders, intruders!
禁止通行！=No passage!
感覺還有需要調查的地方……=Feels like there's still more to investigate...
前方感知到大量陰影，\n看來那扇門後，就是『覲見室』了。=I sensed a lot of Shadows ahead, the "Audience Chamber" must be behind that door.
嗯……但是那個機關\n需要變成螞蟻才能利用。=Hmm... but we need to transform into ants to use this mechanism.
WONDER，找找看附近有沒有\n可以用來變身的肖像畫吧。=Wonder, look around to see if there's a transformation portrait.
WONDER，保持工蟻形態\n回到剛才的地方吧。=Wonder, stay in ant form and go back to where you were.
啊！下面的結晶\n被費洛蒙能量連接起來了！=Ah! The crystals below are connected!
好，WONDER，前進吧！=Alright, Wonder, let's go!
前面就是『覲見室』了……\nWONDER，準備好了嗎？=The "Audience Chamber" is ahead... \nWonder, are you ready?

Encountered Shadow Shimotsuna

這裡是……？\n和其他地方的氛圍完全不一樣啊……=This is...? The feel is completely different from other areas...
這也太花俏了吧……\n看得我眼睛都要花了。=It's so flashy... My eyes hurt just looking at this.
這也是{{A}}的認知嗎？\n簡直就像……少女動畫的拍攝現場一樣……=Is this {{A}}'s cognition too? It's like... a set from a magical girl anime...
興奮的螞蟻陰影=Excited Ant Shadow
哈……哈……\n您就是{{A}}吧？=Huh... Huh... Are you {{A}}?
這、這些傢伙要幹什麼？=Wh-what do these guys want?
我的確就是{{A}}……=I am indeed {{A}}...
接待的螞蟻陰影=Reception Ant Shadow
哦哦……這張臉果然沒錯！\n{{A}}可是{{B}}欽點的貴賓。=Oooh... That face is unmistakable! {{A}} is a VIP personally selected by {{B}}.
您可不能待在這麼骯髒的樓層。\n請您跟我們去上面的貴賓層！！=You cannot stay in such a filthy lower floor. Please accompany us to the exclusive upper floor!
唔……上層！？=Huh... Upper floor!?
{{A}}的氣息就是從這座塔的上層傳來的。\n這邀請來得正好……！=I sense the {{A}}'s presence from the top of this tower. What a welcome invitation...!
之前，入口的陰影一看到{{A}}，\n就立刻讓我們通行了……=Earlier, the Shadows at the entrance let us through as soon as they saw {{A}}...
現在也是，陰影一認出{{A}}的臉，\n就馬上給予優待。=And now, the moment they recognize his face, they're treating him like royalty.
也就是說……？=That means...?
{{B}}對{{A}}真是相當執著啊。={{B}} is obsessed with {{A}}.
但再一起前進的話，\n{{A}}可能會有危險吧！？=If we keep going, won't {{A}} be in danger!?
但同時也是機會吧？\n讓{{A}}的機會。=But isn't this our chance to {{A}}.
這樣的話，我還是想接受邀請。\n雖然因為我的拖累會更危險，抱歉……=In that case, I'd still like to accept. Sorry for making things more dangerous by coming along...
拜託你了，WONDER。=Please, Wonder.
我知道了，一起走吧！=Got it, let's go together!
帶我們去貴賓區吧！=<size\=30>Take us to the VIP area!</size>
……啊？只有{{A}}能上去。\n你們不可以。=...Huh? Only {{A}} is allowed. You lot cannot come.
尤其是那兩個女的，和戴兜帽的奇怪生物。\n絕對不會放你們過去的！=Especially those two girls and that hooded creature. No entry!
謔！？\n誰是奇怪生物啊！！=Huh!? What hooded creature!!
只帶走{{A}}可不行！=Can't just let you take only {{A}}!
沒錯！\n別那麼死板，也招待我們上去啊！=Right! Quit being so rigid, just invite us too!
那就只能來硬的了！\n{{A}}不喜歡的傢伙，是沒有人權的！=Then we'll force you! Those disliked by {{A}} have no rights!

真是的！這些傢伙好煩啊！\n怎麼源源不斷地冒出來啊！=Ugh! These guys are so annoying! \nWhy do they keep popping up?
煩死了，你們快讓開！=So annoying! Get out of our way!
看來真的很想帶{{A}}上去呢。\n不過……我是不會把他交給你們的！=They really want to take {{A}}. \nBut... I won't hand him over!
好～了，我已經錄音了哦～<sprite\=1 tint\=1>=Got it～ I've got it all recorded～<sprite\=1 tint\=1>
什麼……！？=What...!?
CLOSER！？WIND！？=Closer!? Wind!?
等等、啥情況！？=Wait, what's happening!?
動、動不了……！\n我們這是怎麼了！？=C-can't move...! What happened to us!?
你們變成雜誌了……=<size\=27>You've become magazines...</size>
你們上雜誌封面了……=You're on the cover...

Choice 1
雜誌！？這這這、這是怎麼回事！？=Magazines!? Wh-what's going on!?
Choice 2
上封面了！？你在說什麼？\n怎麼回事啊！？=On the cover!? What are you talking about? What's going on!?
{{A}}！\n要是被我抓住說話的把柄，你們就完囉～！={{A}}! Once I've got you on record, you're finished～!
{{B}}，{{A}}你真是的……={{B}}, oh {{A}}...
為了見我竟然跑來這種地方啊……\n討厭～<sprite\=1 tint\=1>真是拿你沒辦法啦。=To think you'd come all this way just to see me... Ara～<sprite\=1 tint\=1> You're hopeless.
這個閃瞎眼的傢伙是誰啊……！=Who is this walking eyesore...!
這個聲音，難道是……\n{{A}}？=That voice, could it be... {{A}}?
討厭了啦，除了我還有誰呀？\n沒錯，我就是{{A}}……=Oh please, who else would it be? That's right, I'm {{A}}...
是你的「{{A}}」哦。=Your "{{A}}".
{{A}}！好噁心！！={{A}}! That's disgusting!!
那個樣子，和扭曲的程度……\n看來就是{{A}}了……！=That appearance... that level of distortion... This must be {{A}}...!
是你把我們變成這樣的？\n快點讓我們變回去！=You're the one who turned us into this? Turn us back, now!
哎呀哎呀，\n真是一群又菜又愛叫的小狗呢。=Ara ara, what a bunch of yappy little mutts.
越是口出狂言，對自己不利的黑料就越多，\n難道你們不明白嗎？=The more you bark, the more dirt I get on you. Don't you know how this works?
狂言？=Bark?
黑料？=Dirt?
「煩死了，你們快讓開！」="So annoying! Get out of our way!"
「我是不會把他交給你們的！」="I won't hand him over!"
這就是你們口出狂言的證據哦，\n暴力女和跟蹤狂。=Here's the undeniable proof, violent brute and delusional stalker.
跟蹤狂……我……？=Stalker... Me...?
{{A}}才不是！\n你這純屬找碴啊！={{A}} No way! You're just making things up!
真～可～惜～有錄音為證呢。\n不管你怎麼解釋，也沒有人會信啦。=Too～ Bad～ I've got it all recorded. No matter how you explain it, no one will believe you.
已經不可能再有反轉了。\n你們就乖乖地等著迎接社會性死亡吧！=There's no coming back from this. Just sit tight and wait for your social execution!
吾明白了！原來是這麼回事……！=I see now! So that's how it works...!
現實裡的{{A}}，\n利用捕風捉影的證據來歪曲事實……=The real {{A}} twists the truth using half-baked evidence...
以此毀掉了那些阻礙她的藝人，\n或者其他有社會地位的人……=To ruin anyone who stands in her way, celebrities, public figures...
這些都知道了！長話短說！=We know that! Get to the point!
你們想想，吾等不也親眼見過……\n她拿錄音筆威脅別人的樣子嗎？=Do you remember... We've seen her threaten people with that recorder before!
啊……這麼說起來的確……！=Ah... Now that you mention it...!
她那個超級花俏的東西，\n就是錄音筆啊！？=That gaudy thing she's holding, that's her recorder!?
她已經利用錄音，陷害了很多人了。=She's already framed so many people with her recordings.
以成功經歷為後盾的絕對自信……=Her unshakable confidence, backed by her success...
只要錄了音，對方就是手心裡的玩物……\n這種認知影響了整座{{A}}！=Once she's got you on tape, you're hers... That cognition has shaped this entire {{A}}!
也、也就是說……\n什麼意思嘛……！=S-So... what does that mean...!
還不懂嗎！就是只要在她面前說錯話，\n就會像那樣被變成雜誌……！=Don't you get it! If you say the wrong thing in front of her, you'll get turned into a magazine...!
只是說個話就！？\n啥呀！這已經算開掛了吧！=Just from talking!? That's cheating!
別隨便說話=Don't speak
別出聲=Stay silent
來吧，{{A}}！我已經搞定了礙事的女人。\n快來我身邊！=Now, {{A}}! I've taken care of those pesky girls. Come to me!
我、我拒絕……！=I... I refuse!
回答錯誤～\n該說「好的，我很樂意，{{A}}」哦。=Wrong answer～ The correct response is "Yes, I'd love to, {{A}}".
超可愛的{{A}}<sprite\=1 tint\=1>\n我會永～～～遠養、著、你哦！=My adorable {{A}}<sprite\=1 tint\=1> I will keep you... forever～～～!
……你們算什麼東西！？\n太礙事了！給我讓開！=...What insignificant pests!? Out of my sight! Now!

Shadow Shimotsuna Boss 1

大家小心！\n就像剛才CATTLE說的那樣……=Everyone, be careful! Like Cattle said earlier...
如果說錯話被她錄下來，\n就會被變成雜誌、無法動彈了！=If she records you misspeaking, you'll get turned into a helpless magazine!
如果我們全都變成雜誌就完了。\n總之要注意言辭！明白了嗎？=If we all get turned into magazines, it's over. Anyway, be careful with your words! Got it?
{{A}}～我明明也沒說錯什麼啊……！={{A}}～ I didn't even say anything wrong...!
抱歉，我沒法幫上忙了！\n大家要加油啊！=Sorry, I can't help anymore! \nHang in there, everyone!
要說幾、次、啊！\n你太吵了，臭女人！！=How many times do I have to say it! \nYou're too loud, you hag!!
呀啊！？=Ah!?
CLOSER！=Closer!
你幹什麼！=What are you doing!
從被我抓到尾巴寫成報導的一刻起，\n你們就已經完蛋了！=From the moment I caught you, you're finished!
不准再違抗我！只能奉承我、討好我，\n在我的憐憫下悲慘地生活！=No more defiance! You'll praise and obey me, live miserably under my mercy!
你的謠言毀掉了多少人的人生！\n到底是有多麼{{A}}才做得出來……！=How many lives have you ruined with your lies! Just how prideful can you be...!
{{A}}～？\n{{B}}，不對哦，我這才不是{{A}}。=Prideful～？{{B}}, wrong, this isn't pride.
這是我被賦予的權力！\n任何事、任何人，我都能隨意玩弄！！=This power was bestowed upon me! \nI can twist anything, crush anyone!!
呀啊！=Ah!

你剛才想說什麼呢，小夥子～？\n要注意言辭哦？=What were you about to say, boy～? \nBetter choose your words carefully.
不過啊，你們幾個看起來底子也不錯呢～\n我不會毀掉你們的，而是慢慢養～起～來哦<sprite\=1 tint\=1>=But you know, you do have potential～ \nI won't ruin you, I'll raise you instead～<sprite\=1 tint\=1>
要是把你們變成薄～薄的雜誌，\n這麼美好的肉體可就浪費了呢？=Turning you into flimsy～ magazines, would be such a waste of these fine bodies, no?
只不過，在開始飼養之前……\n得讓你們知道誰才是{{A}}！！=But before I tame you... \nYou'll learn who's the {{A}}!

來吧，都過來！讓這些傢伙跪下吧！=Come, all of you! Make these fools kneel!
{{B}}……等著吧，{{A}}～。你很快就是我的東西了～={{B}}... Just wait, {{A}}～\nYou'll be mine soon enough～
休想！絕對不會讓你帶走{{A}}的！=Forget it! I won't let you take {{A}}!
是先消滅手下，還是直接攻擊{{A}}……就交給隊長判斷了！=Should we take out the minions first, or go straight for {{A}}...? Leader, your call!
{{B}}！這是來自大人的愛意！{{A}}萬歲！！={{B}}! This is true affection from Her Majesty! All hail {{A}}!
就是這樣，把這些傢伙大卸八塊吧！{{A}}！=That's right! Tear these brats to pieces! {{A}}!
有意思，我看你們還能反抗到什麼時候！=Amusing, let's see how long you can keep resisting!
這些小鬼……真是夠煩人的！=These damn kids... \nWhat a nuisance!
真是囂張……先從那個傢伙開始收拾！=How insolent... Start by crushing that one first!
唔……她好像鎖定了一個人作為目標。要小心應對！=Hmm... She seems to be singling out a target. Stay sharp!
{{A}}，廢物！都是一群沒用的廢物……！\n喂，還有沒有人啊！？={{A}}, useless! Absolutely useless...! \nHey, is there anyone else!?
看來她已經召喚不出手下了。\n趁現在打倒她！=Looks like she ran out of minions to summon. \nNow's our chance, take her down!

可惡……那傢伙好厲害……！=Damn it... They are strong...!
唔，沒有CLOSER和WIND，\n要對付她還真難……！=Yes, without Closer and Wind, she is tough...!
而且不知道為何，\n那傢伙還沒對吾等使用那個魔杖。=And for some reason, she hasn't used that wand on us yet.
明明隨時都能把吾等變成雜誌……\n這對她來說是綽綽有餘的吧。=She could turn us into magazines anytime... She's just toying with us.
可惡！這下真是糟透了……=Damn! This is bad...
必須跟她拼到底=<size\=28>Fight her to the bitter end</size>
放棄的話一切都完了=It's over if we give up
你真不錯呢……\n那種絕不屈服的鬥志，讓我好喜歡……=You're interesting... \nThat unyielding spirit, I like it...
要不你跟{{A}}一起穿上成對的衣服，\n然後讓我好好疼愛你們倆吧～<sprite\=1 tint\=1>=How about you and {{A}} wear matching outfits, I'll take good care of you both～<sprite\=1 tint\=1>
我只是{{A}}的配菜嗎？=I'm just {{A}}'s side dish?

Choice 1
你問我為什麼……\n{{A}}，當然是因為他對我很重要啊。=Why, you ask...? {{A}}, because he's special, of course.
Choice 2
哎呀呀，這就開始吃醋了？\n不過抱歉哦，他可是特別的存在。=Ara ara, getting jealous? Sorry, but he's special.
{{A}}可是「從鑽石中誕生的原石」……\n是顆一定會閃閃發光的寶石呢。={{A}} is "a rough in the diamond"... \nA jewel predestined to dazzle.
他可是在很～～早以前就註定屬於我，\n是超級可愛的寶貝鑽石呢！=He was always meant to be mine～～ \nMy precious, precious diamond!
從鑽石中誕生的原石……？\n這完全說反了吧！=A rough in the diamond...? \nThat's completely backwards!
你們才不會明白呢。\n唔呼呼呼呼<sprite\=1 tint\=1>=You'd never understand. Muhahaha<sprite\=1 tint\=1>
就算你們再可愛，要是打擾到{{A}}和我，\n也會被馬上甩掉哦。=No matter how cute you are, if you get between me and {{A}}, I'll dump you.
差不多了，隨便找些黑料，\n把你們也都寫成報導吧！=Enough. I'll simply unearth some dirt and have you all splashed across the headlines.
糟糕！她準備使用那個能力了！\n大家注意！=Crap! She's about to use that power! \nEveryone, watch out!
掙扎也沒用的！\n無論你們說什麼我都可以寫成黑料喲～！=Struggling is useless! I can twist whatever you say into scandal!～!
住手！！=Stop!!
請住手吧，{{A}}……=Please stop, {{A}}...
你的目的是我吧？\n只要我成為你的東西，你就滿足了對吧？=You want me, right? If I become yours, \nwill that satisfy you?
我明白的……這樣的話……=I understand... In that case...
我會成為你的寵物狗，或者任何東西！=I'll be your dog, your anything!
所以……\n請把CLOSER和WIND變回來吧！=So... please turn Closer and Wind back!
你別亂說話，{{A}}！=Don't say that, {{A}}!
你知道被關押在這座{{A}}裡……\n意味著什麼嗎！=Do you realize what being trapped in this {{A}} means!
你的餘生都將被困在{{A}}，\n再也無法回到現實，等於死掉了啊！=You'll be trapped in the {{A}} for the rest of your life, never returning to reality! It's as good as death!
你們不也一樣嗎？難道想變成雜誌……\n一輩子在這裡受折磨嗎？=And what about you!? You want to be turned into a magazine... tortured for eternity?
我已經……無所謂了。\n犧牲我1個就能救你們，已經很划算了。=I... don't care anymore. If sacrificing me saves you all, it's worth it.
別放棄自己！=Don't give up yourself!
{{A}}……\n我可以把一生都獻給你，但我有個請求。={{A}}... I'll give you my entire life, \nbut I have one request.
哎呀～當然可以，{{A}}！\n你可以盡情向我撒嬌哦！=Ara～ Of course, {{A}}! \nYou can beg me for anything!
希望你能保證……不要對我父母出手。=Promise me... you'll never touch my parents.
你能發誓，\n今後不會再做出傷害我爸媽的事嗎？=Can you swear you'll never hurt them again?
哈～～～？=Hah～～～?
哈？哈？？哈？？？\n你還把那個女人當寶啊！？=Hah? Hah?? HAH??? \nYou still care about that woman!?
那個欺騙、拋棄了你跟你爸的臭女人！\n你還這麼看重她！哈！？=That cheating, child-abandoning whore! \nAnd you defend her!? HAH!?
那不是……你寫的假新聞嘛！\n我媽媽根本沒有背叛過我們！=That was... your fake news! \nMy mom never betrayed us!
背叛了啊～！我寫的都是真的！\n那女的就是出軌丈夫、拋棄孩子的賤人！=She did～! Every word I wrote was fact! That wretched woman cheated on her husband and abandoned her child!
不是的！=No!
你肯定不知道，\n我媽媽一直都在跟我道歉……=You don't know... \nMy mom kept apologized to me...
她說：「因為我不夠堅強，\n沒辦法陪在你身邊，對不起……」=She said "I'm sorry... I wasn't strong enough, \nI couldn't be there for you..."
她總是、總是流著眼淚對我道歉……\n說讓我這麼孤獨都是她的錯……！=She cried... saying it was her fault I was lonely...!
我爸爸也是！\n即使被嘲笑成分居夫妻、沒人要的丈夫……=And my dad! Even when people mocked him... Called him a cuckold, a loser...
他也一直愛著媽媽、一直支持她。=He never stopped loving her, never stopped supporting her.
他們彼此相愛、彼此信任……\n我也愛著他們，也相信他們！=They love each other, trust each other... And I love them and believe in them!
啊——哈、哈、哈！=A- HAHAHA!
你還真是天真啊，{{A}}。\n果然還是個孩子呢，竟然被這種演技騙了！=You're so naive, {{A}}. \nStill a child, falling for acting!
你說什麼！？=What!?
你聽好了哦，那個女人順利地逃回義大利，\n然後一直過著光鮮亮麗的明星生活。=Listen close. That woman ran back to Italy and lived lavishly as a star.
而你跟你爸卻被遺棄在了日本，\n這是不爭的事實吧！=While you and your dad rotted in Japan! \nThis is an indisputable trust!
我都說過了，那是……！=I told you, that's...!
我再問你，自從你們分開以後，\n那個女人回國了幾次？=Tell me, since she left, \nhow many times has she visited you?
頂多每年回來1次吧？\n但你們可沒少去義大利吧？=Once a year? But you've been to Italy quite a lot, haven't you?
你怎麼連這些事情都……=How do you even...
我當然知道。\n關於你們一家，我什～麼都知道呢！=Of course I know. \nI know everything about your family～!
你說，如果你媽媽真的愛你……\n怎麼會不多來見見你？=If she loved you... \nwhy wouldn't she see you more?
那是因為……\n她一回來，媒體就會撲上來……=That's because... the media would swarm her...
可即使那樣也要見自己的兒子，\n這才是真正的母愛吧！=A real mother would fight to see her son, \nthat's mother's love!
{{A}}，她倒是爽啦！\n自己在義大利過著輕鬆愉快的單身生活！={{A}}, she enjoyed it! Living free in Italy!
然後對很～偶爾才見一面的兒子，\n只要擠幾滴眼淚就能騙得團團轉！=Even though she barely sees you, she fooled you with just a few tears!
不是！媽媽才、才不是那樣……=No! Mom is not like that...
就、是、那、樣、的！！\n你忘了嗎？那個女人可是演員啊，演員！=She, is, like, that!! Or did you forget? \nShe's an actress, actress!
哭戲什麼的可是基本功哦。\n在你面前流的眼淚……全部都是演技呢！=Crying on cue is basic. Those tears... all acting!
你真的好可憐啊，{{A}}。\n你對那個女人來說，只不過是負擔罷了。=Poor {{A}}. To her, you're just baggage.
不是的！我……！=No! I...!
哈……真拿你沒辦法。\n那就讓你親耳聽一聽，真實的證言吧……=Sigh... Fine. I'll let you hear the truth...
……從她本人口中！=...From her own mouth!
媽媽！=Mom!
來，你跟他說。\n親口把真相說出來！=Go on, tell him. Tell him the truth!
我……背叛了丈夫，拋棄了兒子……=I... betrayed my husband, \nabandoned my son...
為什麼？\n因為你兒子對你來說是個負擔吧！？=Why? Because he was a burden, right!?
是的，是個負擔。\n養孩子太無聊了，我還想多跟男人玩玩。=Yes, a burden. Children are boring, \nI wanted to play with men.
在日本有個丈夫，又在義大利享受單身，\n真是太美好了。=It's wonderful to have a husband in Japan and enjoy single life in Italy.
別聽她瞎說！=Don't listen to her!
那只是認知存在！=<size\=26>That's just a cognitive being!</size>
沒錯，那不是你真正的母親！\n不要被迷惑了！=Right, that's not your real mother! \nDon't fall for it!
為了騙過丈夫，我只能偶爾去去日本，\n在孩子面前假裝掉幾滴眼淚……=To deceive my husband, I only went to Japan occasionally, forcing out a few tears in front of my child...
其實我真的覺得很麻煩。\n早知道不生孩子了，根本就是個累贅。=I regret having him. He was just in the way.
呐，{{A}}。\n你肯定也覺得，父母什麼的無所謂吧？=Hey, {{A}}. You don't care about us, don't you?
畢竟分開生活10多年了你也沒抱怨過，\n已經完全習慣了呢。=After all, you never complained in ten years, \nyou've completely adapted by now.
我們其實根本就不需要家人，對吧？=We don't need family, right?
媽……媽……！=M... Mom...!
你現在明白了吧？我說的都是對的。\n剛才那些就是那個賤人的心裡話哦。=Now you understand? I was right. \nThose were her true feelings.
才不是！\n是你故意讓她這麼說的吧！=No! You made her say that!
你其實心裡是知道的吧，{{A}}？\n只不過是在自己騙自己吧？=You knew, didn't you, {{A}}? \nYou were lying to yourself!
夫妻分居兩地還能相親相愛？還愛著孩子？\n全～部都是大大的謊言！=How can a couple still love each other when living apart? Still care for their child? It's all lies～!
不是……謊言……！=Not... lies...!
我懂的哦，{{A}}。\n我知道你一～直都在撒謊呢。=I understand, {{A}}. \nI know you've been lying～
戴著笑臉一樣的面具，對誰都是笑眯眯的，\n但也對誰～都不說心裡話！=Wearing that smiling mask, \nbut hiding everything～!
你和那個女的一樣，都是騙子！\n{{A}}，你們家除了騙子還是騙子！=Like mother, like child, both frauds! \n{{A}}, lying runs in your family!
小時候的{{A}}=Little {{A}}
媽媽……你又要走了嗎？=Mamma... are you leaving again?
{{A}}的母親={{A}}'s Mother
對不起啊，{{A}}……=Sorry, {{A}}...
為什麼我不能跟媽媽一起住啊？=Why can't I live with you, mamma?
對不起……對不起，{{A}}……=Sorry... I'm sorry, {{A}}...
全都是媽媽不好……\n都怪媽媽太軟弱，受不了那些非議……=It's mamma's fault... \nMamma's weak..
{{B}}……都怪我，我這種人……\n讓他跟{{A}}吃了這麼多苦……={{B}}... It's all my fault, \nI made him and {{A}} suffer...
媽媽！媽媽，你別哭！\n對不起，媽媽！=Mamma! Mamma, don't cry! Sorry, mamma!
我沒事的！\n即使分開我也沒事的！所以你別哭，媽媽！=I'm fine! Even if we're apart, I'm fine! \nSo don't cry, mamma!
{{A}}的父親={{A}}'s Father
你不能讓媽媽難過哦，{{A}}。\n因為最痛苦的就是她啊。=You can't make mom sad, {{A}}. \nShe's hurting the most.
嗯……媽媽她哭了……=Hm... Mamma cried...
你一哭媽媽就會更難過了。=If you cry, she'll cry more.
所以你要在媽媽面前保持微笑哦。\n好不好？{{A}}。=So you have to smile in front of her, okay? {{A}}.
……爸爸你呢？\n跟媽媽分開，不孤單嗎？=...Papa, are you really okay? \nYou're not lonely without mamma?
我當然孤單啦！\n但是爸爸可是……有名的演員哦！=Of course I am! \nBut papa... is a famous actor!
表演笑容那可是小菜一碟！\n你聽好哦，在表演笑的時候啊……=Faking smiles is easy! \nWhen you act a smile...
（這樣啊……因為爸爸是演員，\n所以在媽媽面前才能不哭啊。）=(...I see. Because papa is an actor... he can pretend not to cry in front of mamma.)
（那我也要用「演技」好好地笑，\n這樣媽媽也一定會對我笑的……）=(Then I'll "act" too... If I smile hard enough, mamma will smile back.)
住在附近的主婦=Neighbor Housewife
旁邊剛搬來的{{A}}家，就是那家人吧？\n太太是那個義大利有名女演員……=That's the {{A}} family, right? \nThe wife's that Italian actress...
喜歡八卦的主婦=Gossip-Loving Housewife
對對！而且真的是婚後分居哦！\n好像是妻子出軌了吧？=Yeah! And they're separated! \nHeard she cheated!
快點離婚不就好了嘛。\n這樣孩子多可憐啊。=Just divorce already. Poor kid.
你別說，他家孩子好像也有問題哦？\n好像是在學校打了其他孩子什麼的……=The kid's weird too. \nHe hit another kid at school...
說是因為別人先罵他媽媽……\n但那不是很正常嗎，肯定會被人說的嘛。=Heard it was because someone scolded his mom... but isn't that normal? People will definitely talk about it.
有其母必有其子吧？\n哎呀，爸爸估計也不是什麼好人。=Like mother, like son. \nThe dad's probably no better.
（……如果我闖了禍，\n媽媽和爸爸就會被人說壞話。）=(...If I cause trouble, people will insult mamma and papa.)
（看來我不能生氣。即使被欺負，\n也必須裝作沒事才行……）=(I can't get angry. Even if bullied, \nI have to pretend it's fine...)
（我要一直笑，給自己戴上面具。\n要繼續「撒謊」才行，不能傷害別人……）=(It's fine to always smile, let's put on a mask. If I keep "lying", no one gets hurt...)
演出的時候真的很輕鬆。\n因為演戲不算「撒謊」啊。=Acting is easy. Because it's not really "lying".
「來，讓我看看你真正的想法……\n你誠實的內心吧！」="Come, let me see your true thoughts... \nyour honest heart!"
如果讓別人知道了我的真心，\n就一定會受到傷害……=But if people knew my true feelings, they'd get hurt...
比起「誠實」，不如徹底貫徹「謊言」，這樣才不會傷害別人。=Rather than "honesty", it's better to fully embrace "lies", that way no one gets hurt.
我已經不需要真正的自己了。想要「誠實」地活下去的意志……=I don't need my true self. The will to live with "honesty"...
把它從心中扔掉吧。=Throw it all away.
沒錯……你說得對……=Right... You are right...
我一直……都在撒謊。\n無論對父母，還是對朋友、夥伴……=I've always... been lying. To my parents, my friends, everyone...
什麼真心、誠實、真實，統統沒有。\n我是個……渾身都是謊言的人……！=There is no sincerity, honesty or truth at all. I am... a person who is full of lies...!
沒——錯！\n你這不是醒悟了嘛，{{A}}！=Exactly-! So you finally understand, {{A}}.
你嘴裡的什麼「幸福家庭」就是謊言！\n你跟那個臭女人一樣，都是大騙子！=Your so called "happy family" was fake! \nYou're a liar, just like your mother!
趕快，現在就把那個賤人忘掉吧！=Forget that whore, now!
不管你是多大的騙子……\n我都會好好地、精心地呵護你哦……=No matter how much you lie... I'll cherish you...
閉嘴！=Shut up!
才不是謊言！=It's not a lie!
……哈！？=...Huh!?
沒錯！\n你給我閉嘴，臭老太婆！=Yeah! I said shut up, you old hag!
你根本就不懂{{A}}！=You don't know {{A}}!
我們早就從{{A}}那裡聽過這些了！\n他說過，在別人面前說不出心裡話！=He told us everything! How he couldn't speak his mind!
你懂這有多痛苦嗎！？\n為了不讓爸媽傷心，從小就這麼懂事……=Do you know how painful this is!? He's spent his whole life trying not to hurt his parents...
這早就不算「謊言」了！\n這才是{{A}}「誠實」活著的證明！！=That's no "lie"! It's proof {{A}} truly lived with "honesty"!!
你……=You...
呐，{{A}}，你還記得在{{B}}時……\n你跟我們說過的話吧？=Hey, {{A}}, you remember what you told us back in {{B}}... right?
那個時候，\n你不就對我們說了最真心的話嘛！=Didn't you tell us the truth back then!
那些話不是「演技」=Those weren't "acting"
那些話不是「謊言」=Those weren't "lies"

Choice 1
沒錯！你吃著{{A}}的拉麵，喊著好吃！\n然後大家聊得很開心……=That's right! You ate {{A}}'s ramen and said it was delicious! We all had such a great time together...
Choice 2
沒錯！我們3個一起吃到撐，\n然後聊了好多傻乎乎的話題……=That's right! The three of us stuffed ourselves silly, and talked about all kinds of dumb...
那些才不是演技對吧！\n那就是真正的你，不是嗎，{{A}}！？=That wasn't acting, was it! That was the real you, wasn't it, {{A}}!?
真正的……我……=The... real me...
不要聽{{B}}的話，{{A}}。\n那個母親是認知存在，只是唬人的罷了！=Don't listen to {{B}}, {{A}}! That mother is just a cognitive being, it's just an illusion!
煩死了……！=So annoying...!
{{A}}夠了！\n吵死了，你們都給我閉嘴！！={{A}}! Enough, shut your mouths!!
「你給我閉嘴，臭老太婆！」="I said shut up, you old hag!"
「只是唬人的罷了！」="It's just an illusion!"
好了，\n我已經拿到你們暴言的證據了～=Got it, now I've got proof of your violent threats～
糟了……！=Crap...!
SOY！=Soy!
CATTLE！=Cattle!
{{A}}！\n下一個輪到你了哦！={{A}}! \nYou're next!
不可原諒……=Unforgivable...
絕不會把{{A}}給你的=<size\=29>I'll never give you {{A}}</size>
好了～我錄下你那句話了哦～！！\n來，把你也……=Oh～ I recorded that too～!! \nNow, let's turn you into...
夠了！=Enough!
住手吧……\n夠了，已經夠了，WONDER。=Stop... Enough, that's enough, Wonder.
我爸媽都不愛我……我其實都明白。=My parents never loved me... \nI've known it all along.
全部都是「謊言」。無論家人還是自己，\n全部，都只是謊言罷了……=It was all a "lie". My family or myself, \nall of it, nothing but lies...
{{A}}！沒錯沒錯！\n來，你也快說幾句！={{A}}! Yes, yes! \nGo on, say it!
我……一直以來都在欺騙我兒子。\n我們都一樣吧，{{A}}？=I... lied to my son. \nWe're the same, {{A}}.
是啊，媽媽……=Yes, mom...
喂！等等啊，{{A}}！\n都說了那個只是你老媽的認知存在啊！=Hey! Wait, {{A}}! Told you that's just your mom's cognitive being!
那叫家人間的互相體諒，不是撒謊！\n你不是說過嗎，正是因為愛所以……=That's called caring for family, not lying! Didn't you say it yourself, because you love...
謝謝你，SOY……\n但是我家跟你家不一樣。=Thank you, Soy... \nBut my family isn't like yours.
媽媽……實際上我也……\n我也覺得，你哭哭啼啼的真的很煩。=Mom... honestly, I... I hated your crying too, \nit was annoying.
你別這麼說……=Don't say that...
啊——{{B}}！\n太棒了！棒極了，{{A}}！=Ah- {{B}}! Perfect! Wonderful, {{A}}!
別過去！=Don't go!
抱歉啊，WONDER。=Sorry, Wonder.
{{A}}，即使我是這樣的人……\n你也不會嫌棄的，對吧？={{A}}, even if I'm like this... \nYou'll still want me, right?
對、對！讓我好好疼愛你吧！\n我會一～直一～直養著你的哦！=Y-yes! Let me love you! \nI'll cherish you forever～!

你發誓，從今天起就是我的人了！\n你發誓，要成為我最棒的乖狗狗！=Swear you'll be mine! \nSwear you'll be my perfect little dog!
好，我在此發誓……=Alright, I swear...
我發誓——\n會從你那裡奪回一切！！=I swear-\nI'll take everything back from you!!
WONDER！=Wonder!
原來如此……！=I see...!
我們……變回來了……！=We're... back to normal...!
你你你、你幹什麼啊！\n我的魔法錄音筆！！=Wh-wh-what are you doing! \nMy magic recorder!!
{{A}}，你！={{A}}, you!
笨～蛋。=Fool～
你你你……\n你竟然騙我{{A}}！！={{A}}... \nY-y-you lied to me!!
我本來就是個騙子啊？\n這不你說的嘛。=I am a liar, right? \nYou said so.
被演員的眼淚騙得團團轉，\n看來你不適合在娛樂圈混哦？=If you fell for an actor's tears, \nmaybe you're not cut out for this industry?
哈——！？=Hah-!?
就因為你不好好採訪，光顧著寫些假新聞，\n所以眼神才越來越差啊，你這混蛋！=Too busy writing fake news to spot real lies! No wonder your judgment's so rotten, you hack!
你、你這個臭小子！=Y-you brat!
……不過你剛才的話，\n也讓我意識到了一些事。=...But you did help me realize something.
我啊……\n無論在誰面前，都一直隱藏著「自己」。=I've... always hidden "myself" from everyone.
即使在舞臺上，我也不敢投入感情，\n所以表演也流於表面。=Even on stage, I held back, \nmy acting was empty.
是因為會傷害到別人……嗎？\n不。=Because I'd hurt others...? No.
如果我展現出真實的自我，\n恐怕會再次傷害別人什麼的……=If I show my true self, \nI might hurt someone again...
我其實是為了遠離這種恐懼，\n才一直在偽裝自己而已。=I have been pretending to be myself just to stay away from this fear.
媽媽和爸爸的事，也不過都是藉口。\n我其實只是……=Mom and dad were just excuses. I was just...
害怕「自己」的心靈受傷，\n才一直對身邊的人撒謊啊！=Scared of hurting "myself", \nso I keep lying to the people around me!
哈……{{B}}！\n你這不是都明白嘛，{{A}}！=Ha... {{B}}! \nFinally, you get it, {{A}}!
你只不過是為了自己在撒謊罷了！=You lied for your own sake!
沒事的哦，{{A}}。撒謊也沒關係！\n因為那樣就可以獲得幸福嘛！=It's fine, {{A}}. Keep lying! \nThat's how you'll be happy!
欺騙身邊的人，剷除礙事的傢伙！\n跟我一起，一起創造撒謊者的極樂世界吧！=Deceive everyone! Crush your enemies! \nJoin me in a paradise of liars!
別把他跟你混為一談！=<size\=30>Don't lump him in with you!</size>
{{A}}的謊言是不一樣的！=<size\=30>{{A}}'s lies were different!</size>
謝謝你，WONDER。\n但……我已經不想偽裝自己了。=Thank you, Wonder. But... I'm done pretending.
所有的謊言，本質都是一樣的。\n我也是為了自己的幸福才一直撒謊的。=All lies are the same in the end. \nI was lying for myself.
只不過……到此為止了。=But... no more.
我心裡知道。即使讓父母看到真實的我……\n他們也絕不會放棄我的。=Deep down, I knew... even if my parents saw my true self, they'd never give up on me.
還有戲劇部的夥伴們。就算我……\n展示最真實的自己，他們也一定會接受的。=And my drama club friends... Even if I showed my true self, they'd still accept me.
還有看我演出的人們也是……\n他們想看的，是我真正的演技。=And the audience too... \nWhat they want is my genuine performance.
最重要的是……我身邊還有對我不離不棄、\n不顧安危也要拯救我的夥伴們！=Above all... I have friends who'll stand by me no matter what, who'd risk their lives for me!
面對這樣的大家……\n我怎麼還能繼續說謊呢！！=How could I keep lying... to everyone who believes in me!!
跟{{A}}的自己訣別吧=<size\=27>Leave your false self behind</size>
不要放棄慾望……！=<size\=30>Don't give up desires...!</size>
嗯，我不會再自暴自棄了！\n我會「誠實」地面對自己、面對大家！=Yes, no more self-pity! I will face myself and everyone with "honesty"!
我再也不會放棄我的慾望了！=I won't give up my desires ever again!

而且這股力量的波動……被『標記』後\n一旦受到攻擊，可能會陷入異常狀態！=This energy... anyone "marked" will be inflicted with Mental Ailments when hit!
只要保護好被『標記』的同伴就行了吧？\n交給我吧！=So we just need to protect whoever gets "marked", right? Leave it to me!

呼……總算是有驚無險……\n如果沒有{{A}}，不知道會發生什麼呢……=Whew... That was close... If it weren't for {{A}}, who knows what might've happened...

剛才{{A}}和WONDER，\n不是把那個像魔杖似的錄音筆弄壞了嗎？=Didn't {{A}} and Wonder destroy that wand-like recorder earlier?
她離開這裡就是因為那東西壞了，\n還命令部下去修理。=She left because it was broken, \nordering her underlings to repair it.
原來如此。\n那個魔法錄音筆對她就是「力量的象徵」。=I see. That magic recorder was her "symbol of power".
而那個象徵被WONDER他們毀掉了。\n她的陰影意識到了這一點。=And that symbol was destroyed by Wonder. \nHer Shadow recognized this.
這意味著，\n現實裡的{{A}}應該也會受到一些影響吧？=Meaning the real {{A}} should be affected too, right?
沒錯。\n那傢伙膨脹的信心可能會有所動搖。=Correct. Their inflated confidence may be shaken.
意思是和平時正相反？\n認知世界中發生的事，也會影響到現實？=So the opposite of usual? Cognition affecting reality this time?
那她現在就沒那麼有自信了吧。\n說不定暫時不會寫假新聞了？=Then she's probably less confident now. \nMaybe she'll hold off on fake news?
不過，這也是吾一廂情願的推測。\n畢竟現實中的錄音筆並不會消失……=Though this is just speculation. \nHer real recorder isn't actually gone...
不管怎樣時間不多了=Time is running out
還是儘快行動為好=We should act soon
……不，沒事的。\n雖然來{{A}}之前我動搖了……=...No, it's fine. While I was shaken before coming to the {{A}}...
但就算{{A}}寫再多的假新聞,\n我的父母也不會軟弱到受她擺佈。=Even if {{A}} writes more fake news, my parents aren't weak enough to bend to her will.
我爸應該會照顧好我媽，\n反而搞不好會變得更加卿卿我我了。=My dad would support my mom, they might actually become more affectionate.
卿卿……我我……！=More... affectionate...?
他們真的又熱情，又堅強。\n只是我之前單方面不敢相信爸媽而已……=They're passionate and strong. I was just the one who couldn't believe in them...
所以不用擔心我們。\n還是集中精力想辦法讓{{A}}吧。=So don't worry about us. Let's focus on {{A}}.
與其勉強追趕那傢伙，不如先養精蓄銳。\n我們回去吧，WONDER。=Rather than rushing after her, we should regroup. Let's return, Wonder.
我知道了，回去吧=Got it, let's go back
謝謝你能這麼說=Thanks for saying that
啊，等等等等！\n回去之前……=Ah, wait wait! Before we go...
我們先定一下{{A}}的代號吧！=We need to decide {{A}}'s code name!
代號？\n啊，就是像WONDER或SOY那種？=Code name? Ah, like Wonder or Soy?
嗯。目前大家都是……\n以自己覺得「不可思議的東西」起的！=Yeah! Currently... everyone's is based on something they find "mysterious"!
哦～不可思議的東西啊……=Oh～ Something mysterious...
啊，盡可能用外語哦！\n可別用醬油什麼的！=Ah, preferably in a foreign language! \nNo soy sauce or anything!
求能不能放過我啊喂！=Give me a break here!
不可思議的東西，外語……\n嗯……=Something mysterious... in a foreign language... Hmm...
那就……\n「LUCE」吧？=Then... how about "Luce"?
LUCE？{{A}}，感覺好帥……！\n是什麼意思呀？=Luce? {{A}}, that sounds cool...! \nWhat does it mean?
在義大利語裡是「光」的意思。=It means "light" in Italian.
我在舞臺上的時候，\n總會被「光」的作用和不可思議所震撼。=When I'm on stage, I'm always amazed by how "light" works.
只需調整燈光的顏色，\n就能改變時間和季節……=Just changing its color can alter time and seasons...
即便沒有人在那裡，\n也可以使用聚光燈來表現人的動作。=Even with no actors present, a spotlight can convey movement.
這簡直就像魔法一樣，不是嗎？\n小時候爸爸教我時，我就很感動。=It's practically magic, isn't it? My dad taught me this when I was little.
這樣啊～！=I see～!
既能欺騙他人，也能引人入勝。\n這就是「光」。=It can both deceive and captivate. \nThat's "light".
我的名字{{A}}，也蘊含著來自爸媽的……\n「成為舞臺上閃耀的明星」的祝福。=My name {{A}} carries my parents' blessing too... "shine like a star on stage".
所以我的代號也想用「光」。\n如何？=So I want my code name to be "light". \nHow is it?
我覺得很好啊，LUCE！=I think it's great, Luce!
嗯，我也覺得很棒。=Yes, I think it's great too.
{{A}}，LUCE！=<size\=30>{{A}}, Luce!</size>
那我們回去吧，LUCE！=Then let's head back, Luce!

Choice 1
沒問題。\n{{A}}啊，WONDER！=Alright. {{A}}, Wonder!
Choice 2
沒問題。\n我們走吧，WONDER！=Alright. Let's go, Wonder!

{{A}}……好累啊……\n好想馬上洗個澡、鑽被窩啊……={{A}}... I'm exhausted... I just wanna take a shower and crash...
今天就先解散吧。\n啊，對了……=Let's call it a day. Oh, right...
{{B}}，還有{{A}}，\n你們直接叫我「{{C}}」就行了。={{B}}, {{A}}, you can just call me "{{C}}" now.
sr:"^(.*)和(.*)，\n也都跟我用平語了呢。$"="$1 and $2 already speak casually with me too."
這樣嗎？\n那你也可以直接叫我{{A}}。=Oh really? Then you can call me {{A}}.
我也是，叫我{{A}}就行～！\n{{C}}哦，{{B}}！=Same here! Just call me {{A}}～! {{C}}, {{B}}!
{{B}}。感覺好棒啊。\n現在的{{A}}，更像「真正的自己」了。={{B}}. This feels great. You seem more like your "true self" now, {{A}}.
這都多虧了你們啊。\n以後，我再也不會對自己和別人說謊了。=It's all thanks to you guys. I won't lie to myself or others anymore.
怪盜活動也務必讓我幫忙！\n{{A}}！=Please let me help with the Phantom Thief activities too! {{A}}!
唔，{{B}}，{{A}}。=Hm, {{B}}, {{A}}.
{{A}}！？\n剛才這隻貓頭鷹是不是說話了！？={{A}}!? Did that owl just talk!?
Oh mio Dio！！\nMamma mia！！=Oh mio Dio!!\nMamma mia!
的確，你是第一次聽到{{A}}說話呢……\n那個，這就是現實中的CATTLE。=Ah right, this is your first time hearing {{A}} speak... Well, this is the real Cattle.
{{A}}？大家……？={{A}}? Everyone...?
{{B}}，{{A}}！？\n你不是說因為分鏡有問題，回去了嗎？={{B}}, {{A}}!? Didn't you say you went home to fix storyboard issues?
嗯，本來是這樣的，\n但我需要參考照片……=Yes, that was the plan, but I needed reference photos...
所以就來{{A}}拍了點照，\n這就要回家繼續畫了。=So I came to {{A}} to take some photos, \nI was just heading back to keep drawing.
路過的女性=Female Passersby
哎呀，抱歉……=Ah, sorry...
沒、沒事……=I-it's fine...
啊，手機……=Ah, my phone...
別擔心，好像並沒有摔壞。=Don't worry, it didn't break.
謝謝你，{{A}}。=Thank you, {{A}}.
大家這是剛排練完嗎？\n好像都很疲勞的樣子。=Were you all rehearsing? \nYou look pretty worn out.
那個、嗯！沒錯！\n有點用力過猛了……=Uh, yeah! Exactly! We kinda overdid it...
是啊。我們想著要不要喝點茶，\n所以順便來了{{A}}這邊。=Right. We were thinking of getting tea, \nso we stopped by {{A}}.
是……這樣啊。=I... see.
對了，{{A}}也一起去吧？=Right, {{A}}, wanna join us?
不了，我還得趕緊回去畫完分鏡呢。=No, I have to go back and finish the storyboard.
那我先告辭了。=I'll take my leave now.
你要加油哦～！=Do your best～!
那，我們也解散吧。=Alright, let's disband for today.
{{B}}？怎麼了，{{A}}？={{B}}? What is it, {{A}}?
剛才……我不是幫{{A}}撿手機嗎？\n我不小心看到了……=Just now... when I picked up {{A}}'s phone, \nI accidentally saw...
她的手機裡……\n有「{{A}}的圖示」。=Her phone... has the "{{A}} icon".
什麼！？真的嗎，{{A}}！=What!? Is that true, {{A}}!
嗯，我確定我沒看錯。=Yes, I'm not mistaken, I definitely saw it.
那就是說……=That means...
那{{A}}她……=Then {{A}}...
也就是說，她也可以進出{{A}}……\n也能像我一樣覺醒{{B}}嗎？=So she can enter the {{A}} too... \nAnd awaken a {{B}} like me?
不一定……\n有可能她是敵方的人。=Not necessarily... \nShe might be working for the enemy.
……敵人？怎麼回事？=...Enemy? What do you mean?
那個，實際上……=Well, actually...
幕後黑手！\n竟然還有這種傢伙……！=A mastermind! \nThere is actually someone like that...!
我不知道{{A}}究竟是不是……\n不過，我確實想起了一件事。=I don't know if {{A}}'s involved... \nBut I just remembered something.
今天，我們進入{{A}}的時候，\n「啟動{{B}}」的人……是誰？=Today, when we entered the {{A}}, who "activated the {{B}}"...?
那……不是{{A}}嗎？=Wasn't... that {{A}}?
不，我不記得自己點過那個圖示。\n當時覺得有可能是不小心按到了。=No, I don't remember pressing it. Just that there's a chance I messed up.
……現在回想起來，我覺得不是我按的。=...But even if I think about it now, I don't think I pressed it.
那如果是這樣，\n就有可能是當時在場的其他人……=Then that means, \nsomeone else present at the time...
把吾等強制送到了{{A}}。=...Forcibly sent us into the {{A}}.
可、可是……\n{{A}}那個時候已經先一步回家了吧……=B-but... {{A}} said she went home early, right...?
她只是那麼說，然後離開了體育館。\n我們誰都沒看到她到底回沒回家。=She just said that and left the gym. \nNone of us actually saw her leave.
的確如此……\n莫非真是{{A}}幹的？=That's true... So {{A}} really did it?
雖然還不能確定……=It's not confirmed yet...
也許應該調查一下她的情報呢。\n而且，要格外小心。=Maybe we should look into her. \nAnd stay cautious.
唔……大家今天都累了。\n還是先回去休息後再商量吧。=Hmm... Everyone's tired today. \nLet's rest first and discuss later.
也是……\n隊長，那就這麼定了？=Right... Leader, is that okay?

啊，那個……？=Ah, um...?
啊！難道你是……！=Ah! Could you be...!
是的！\n我是{{A}}……不對，不好意思。=Yes!\nI'm {{A}}... No, sorry.
在這裡，請叫我VIOLET。=Here, please call me Violet.
VIOLET？但是你……=Violet? But you...
因為其他世界的{{A}}也在這裡。\n所以吾輩們不公開真名，互相只稱呼代號。=Because the {{A}} from other worlds are also here, we won't reveal our real names and only address each other by code names.
……原來如此。那就重新認識一下。\n{{A}}，VIOLET。=...I see. \n{{A}}, Violet.
嗯，{{B}}！\n原來你也可以召喚{{A}}呀……！=Yes, {{B}}!\nYou can summon a {{A}} too...!
我一直都沒發現。\n對了，你說的跟{{A}}的交易是指……=I had never noticed that before. Right, what deal you've made with the {{A}}...
{{A}}，說來話長。={{A}}, it's a long story.
說來話長……？=It's a long story...?
應該詳細說說=You should explain
一時半會確實很難講清楚。你們可以理解為，\n我在用自己的方式追求「正義」。=It's hard to explain quickly. You can think of it as me pursuing "justice" my way.
比起這個，先告訴我現在的狀況吧。\n你們應該更瞭解這個世界。=More importantly, could you explain the current situation? You seem to know more about this world than I do.
嗯……但在這之前還有一個問題。\n你怎麼會在這裡？=Yes... But first, I have one question. \nWhy are you here?
啊，不好意思。\n還沒聊過這件事呢。=Ah, sorry. \nI haven't talked about that yet.
那我就簡單說明一下。=Let me give a brief explanation.
今天探索了{{A}}的{{B}}，對吧？\n回去的路上，我突然發現手機有點奇怪。=Today we explored {{A}}'s {{B}}, right? \nOn the way home I noticed something strange about my smartphone.
冴……？=Sae...?
那是吾輩們在攻略的{{A}}，不用在意。\n對了，你說的手機很奇怪是指……=That's the {{A}} that we're exploring, don't worry about it. So, why did you feel strange about your smartphone?
沒錯，我發現「{{A}}」有異常波動。=Yes, I noticed a strange fluctuation in the "{{A}}".
這種情況以前從來沒有過。\n我就下了地鐵想調查一下……=This has never happened before. \nSo I got off the train to check...
結果導航開始把我引向「台場」的方向。=The navigation started and led me in the direction of "Odaiba".
那邊正準備新建一個體育場吧。\n到那附近之後，導航波動得更強烈了……=A new stadium is being built there. When I got close to the area, the navigation started fluctuating even more intensely...
我試著點了導航，就被傳送到這個空間了。\n大體經過就是這樣。=I tried tapping the navigation and was transported to this space. That's about it.
果然你也是從那裡……=You must've come from there too...
但你是怎麼到這裡的？=But how did you get here?
你是一個人到這裡的？=You came here alone?
啊，我沒找到出口，\n所以就到這個建築裡看看。=Ah, I couldn't find the exit, \nso I went to this building to investigate.
然後就發現，你們正在這跟陰影戰鬥……\n大概就是這樣。=And then I found you all here fighting Shadow...
啊。對了，我還沒向你道謝……！\n剛才多虧你出手相助，非常感謝！=Ah. Right, I haven't thanked you yet...! \nThank you for your help just now!
不用客氣。\n在{{A}}戰鬥方面，我還算有些心得。=You're welcome. I have some experience when it comes to fighting in the {{A}}.
原來如此……！那就請允許我向你學習。\nCROW……「{{A}}！」=I see...! Then please let me learn from you. \nCrow... "{{A}}!"
C、CROW……{{A}}……？\n算了，你要是覺得這麼稱呼合適的話……=C, Crow... {{A}}...? Well, if you think that's the right way to address me...
你到底有多少個{{A}}啊……=Just how many {{A}}s do you have...
一開始，我只稱呼{{A}}為「{{B}}」……=At first, I only called {{A}} "{{B}}"...
現在身邊經驗豐富的「{{D}}」真的很多呢。\n{{A}}，{{B}}，{{C}}……=Now, there are so many experienced "{{D}}" around me. {{A}}, {{B}}, {{C}}...
還有來自其他世界的怪盜——\n{{A}}，{{B}}！=Also the Phantom Thieves from other worlds- \n{{A}}, {{B}}!
算，算了，隨你吧。=F-forget it, suit yourself.
好了，言歸正傳。所以CROW誤入這裡，\n也是因為{{A}}發生故障，對吧？=Right, going back to the topic. It seems like Crow ended up here was also due to an error caused by the {{A}}, right?
應該沒錯。=Should be correct.
你們似乎經歷過幾次類似的情況，\n有找到逃脫的方法嗎？=Seems like you've experienced similar situations before, have you found a way to escape?
好像有，又好像沒有=Yes and no
好像不太行得通=Didn't seem to work
目前為止的逃脫方式……\n都是偷取一個稱作「核心」的{{A}}。=So far, our way of escaping... Has always been stealing a {{A}} called a "Core".
但在這個{{A}}，吾一直感受不到「核心」……\n吾等只好追著一股強大的氣息，戰鬥到這裡。=But in this {{A}}, I haven't been able to sense the "Core" at all... We can only follow a powerful presence, fighting our way here.
但什麼也沒發生，對嗎？=But nothing happened, right?
原來如此。\n對了，VIOLET你是第一次到這裡來嗎？=I see. \nRight, is this your first time here, Violet?
是的，我是第一次來這。=Yes, it's my first time here.
啊，但之前好像有被傳送到類似的地方……=Ah, but I think I was transported to a similar place before...
類似的地方？\n能詳細說說嗎。=A similar place?\nI'd like to hear more about this.
VIOLET他們說，\n曾潛入過類似的{{A}}……=Violet said they've infiltrated a similar {{A}} before...
謝謝說明。我大致理解了。\n簡單概括一下……=Thank you for the explanation. I roughly understand. To put it simply...
JOKER、MONA、WONDER、CATTLE，\n你們4人曾經多次來過「這裡」。=Joker, Mona, Wonder, Cattle,\nthe four of you have been "here" multiple times.
而「這裡」，\n就是不同世界的人可以同時存在的地方……=And "here", is a place where people from different worlds can exist at the same time...
另外到目前為止，每次被傳送過來時，\n你們都是和{{A}}的其他成員一起。=In addition, every time you were transported here, you were always with the other {{A}} members.
但這次卻不同。取而代之出現的，\n是我和VIOLET……是這個情況吧。=But this time it's different. Instead, Violet and I appeared here... That's the situation, right?
沒錯。=Right.
這麼說來，仔細想想……在這之前，\n吾輩們都是「{{A}}全員」被傳送過來。=Now that you mention it... Thinking carefully... Before this, the "entire {{A}}" were always transported together.
吾等也是如此。但這也可能是因為，\n去{{A}}的時候，都是全員集合後再出發……=Same here. But that might simply be because we always go to the {{A}} with all the members...
反過來說，這可以證明……\n「即使沒有全員集合，也可能被傳送過來」。=Conversely, this proves that... "Even without all the members, it's still possible to be transported here."
而且，我和VIOLET不屬於{{A}}，\n卻也出現在這裡，就更是意外中的意外了。=Furthermore, me and Violet are not {{A}}, which is the exception among exceptions.
記憶裡，我好像是被什麼東西引導著……\n來到了這個世界。也就是說……=From memory, it felt like something was guiding me... Leading me into this world. Which means...
這次兩個世界的交匯是一種「異常情況」……\n需要想想和之前不同的逃脫方法才行。=This time, the convergence of the two worlds is an "abnormal situation"... We'll need to find a different way to escape.
{{A}}，好厲害的分析能力……！={{A}}, you have great analytical skills...!
{{A}}，畢竟我可是「偵探」。={{A}}, I'm a "detective" after all.
什麼，偵探！？=What, a detective!?
啊，你不知道嗎？\n{{A}}可是遠近聞名的高中生偵探……=Ah, you didn't know? \n{{A}} is a famous high school detective...
也被稱為「偵探王子二世」。=He's also known as "The Second Coming of the Detective Prince".
……你們2個先停一停。\n之前還說不能在這裡公開身份的吧？=...You two stop for a moment. Weren't we just saying we shouldn't reveal our identities here?
總之，我和VIOLET來這裡是特殊情況，\n那麼把我們引到這裡的「意義」是什麼呢……=Anyway, since Violet and I being here is a special case, what exactly is the "reason" we were brought here...
想明白這個問題，\n也許就能找到逃脫的線索了。=If we can figure that out, \nwe might find clues on how to escape.
CROW不愧是偵探，\n頭腦真靈活……=As expected from Crow, a detective's mind is really sharp...
但是……對於擾亂世界的怪盜來說，\n偵探通常是宿敵一樣的對手吧？=But... For Phantom Thieves who disrupt the world, isn't a detective usually their nemesis?
在此之前的確會互相試探。\n但現在也算是合作關係了。=Until recently, we did test each other. \nBut now we're working together.
我仍然反對{{A}}的行事方法。\n合作只是為了抓住某個案件的犯人。=I still oppose the {{A}}' actions. \nThis cooperation is only to catch the culprit of a certain case.
某個案件的犯人？=<size\=25>The culprit of a certain case?</size>
反對行事方法？=Oppose their actions?
想知道嗎？\n這件事的話，告訴你倒是也沒什麼關係……=Are you interested?\nI don't think it's a problem if I tell you more...
你們的世界和我們的世界，\n應該有點區別吧。=Your world and our world, \nthere should be some differences.
是的，WONDER他們的世界裡，\n好像沒有發生那起案件。=Yes, in Wonder's world, \nit seems that case didn't happen.
……果然。\n在這種重大事件上會有所差異啊。=...I see. There are differences when it comes to major events.
算了，說起來有些複雜，就不細說了。總之，\n我和{{A}}在一起調查案件的幕後黑手。=<size\=27>Never mind, it's a bit complicated, I won't go into details. Anyway, I'm working with the {{A}} to investigate the mastermind behind the case.</size>
嗯，CROW的推理能力總是能幫上忙。=Yes, Crow's deductive skills always help.
謝謝，我也從你的想法中得到了很多啟發。=Thanks, I've also gained a lot of insight from your ideas.
算是吧。他們重塑精神的行為，\n是在法律允許範圍外的私刑。=<size\=29>Yes. Their actions of changing people's hearts by force, that is lynching outside the scope of the law.</size>
但是與{{B}}合作之後，我也理解了……\n為什麼他們被迫選擇{{A}}這種方式。=But after working with the {{B}}, \nI also understand... Why they were forced to choose the act of {{A}}.
被{{A}}的人，\n其實都是法律無法制裁的壞人。=<size\=30>Those who have experienced a {{A}}, \nare evil people who could not be punished by law.</size>
但就算如此，\n我也沒有完全認同你們的行為。=But even so, that doesn't mean I completely approve of your actions.
探索完那個{{A}}，把案件解決之後……\n我們再聊聊{{B}}的事吧，JOKER。=<size\=30>After exploring that {{A}} and solving the case...\nLet's talk about the {{B}} again, Joker.</size>
從你的想法中，我得到過很多啟發，\n而且，我也非常喜歡和你互相試探的感覺。=<size\=30>I've gotten a lot of inspiration from your ideas, and I like the feeling of testing each other with you.</size>
{{A}}……好吧。={{A}}... Okay.
我早就想說了……=I've been meaning to say this for a while now...
你們2個關係很好吧？=You two get along well, don't you?
怎麼了！？　\n我說了什麼奇怪的話嗎……！？=What!? \nDid I say something weird...!?
……究竟是敵是友，很難說清楚啊。\n畢竟怪盜和偵探立場不同……=<size\=28>...It's hard to say whether we're friends or foes. \nAfter all, the Phantom Thieves and a detective are on opposite sides...</size>
{{A}}，說關係好也沒錯吧。\n現在算是要一起從這脫身的同伴呢。={{A}}, saying we get along isn't wrong either. \nFor now, we're teammates trying to escape together.
好了，情報交換得差不多了，\n我們繼續往前走吧？=Alright, we've exchanged enough information, shall we keep moving forward?
一直在這裡聊下去，\n情況也不會有什麼改變。=Staying here and talking won't change the situation.
唔，說的沒錯。繼續探索吧。\n那就再次拜託你了，CROW。=Hmm, you're right. Let's continue exploring. \nNice to meet you again, Crow.
打倒剛才那個陰影之後，能去的地方變多了。\n先去那裡看看吧。=After defeating that Shadow, there are more places we can go. Let's check those out.

這裡是倉庫…… 吧？\n看起來是相當廣闊的區域呢……=This is a warehouse...? \nIt looks like a pretty vast area...
地方廣闊，也就意味著可能有好幾個出入口。\n千萬不能錯過正確的道路。=A vast area means there could be several entrances and exits. We must be careful not to miss the correct path.
沒錯，而且敵人可能潛藏在陰影裡。\n吾等一邊警戒一邊前進吧。=Right, and the enemies might be hiding in the shadows. Let's proceed with caution.

看樣子對面的電網好像能解除了。=Looks like the electric fence is disabled.
雖然還無法繼續向前，但穿過貨櫃的話，\n或許能到達下層。=Although we can't move forward yet, if we pass through the container, we should be able to reach the lower level.
好，那吾等先下去看看吧，WONDER。=Right, then we'll go down and have a look, Wonder.
哼，那個放哨的陰影……\n是相當強力的傢伙。=Hmm, that sentry Shadow...  \nIs a strong guy.
怎麼樣，WONDER。\n做好戰鬥的準備了嗎？=Well, Wonder.\nAre you ready for combat?
果然如吾所想，這裡是個相當大的倉庫啊……=Just as I thought, this is a pretty big warehouse...
吾輩的鼻子都不管用了。\n雖然能感覺到從深處傳來敵人的氣息……=My senses are no longer reliable. Although I can still feel the enemies' presence coming from deeper inside...
這麼說，我們似乎在正確的道路上。\n現在只能依靠MONA和CATTLE的感知能力了。=So, it seems we're on the right path. For now, we'll have to rely on Mona and Cattle's sensing abilities.
嗯，那便無所畏懼地前進試試吧。\n走吧，WONDER。=Alright, let's move forward fearlessly. \nLet's go, Wonder.

喂！快看那裡。\n又是一個看上去很強的陰影……=Hey! Look over there. \nAnother strong looking Shadow...
那就是你們說的……\n「散發強大氣息的敵人」嗎？=Is that what you were talking about...\n"An enemy with a strong presence"?
沒錯。不知道為什麼……\n這裡到處都有那樣的傢伙。=Yes. For some reason... \nThese enemies are everywhere.
到處都有……也就是說，\n他們像是這個世界的守護者吧。=There are everywhere... That is to say, \nthey are like the guardians of this world.
不管了，打倒那些傢伙之後，\n道路可能就會開啟。一起上吧！=Doesn't matter, the road might open up after we beat that guy. Let's go!
原來如此，確實是個勁敵。=I see, that's definitely a tough opponent.
{{A}}居然連氣息都沒亂……！？={{A}} didn't even lose his breath...!?
雖然是個麻煩的對手，但只要攻擊他的弱點，\n或者從整體上把控好戰局，就沒問題了。=It's a troublesome opponent, but as long as we target its weakes, or control the overall situation, we'll be fine.
真厲害啊，CROW=That's amazing, Crow
真可靠啊=Really reliable
聽你這麼說我很開心。\n不過WONDER的實力也相當不錯呢。=I'm happy to hear that. \nBut Wonder's strength is quite good as well.
雖然口吻有點高高在上，\n但你的戰鬥天賦確實令吾輩佩服。=Though your tone is a bit condescending, \nyour combat talent is truly admirable.
不管怎麼說，\n畢竟你最近才覺醒{{A}}。=After all, \nyou've just recently awakened your {{A}}.
謝謝，MONA。\n我就當你是在誇我了。=Thank you, Mona.\nI'll take that as a compliment.
{{A}}也是「最近」才……\n那我可得加油了……！={{A}} is also just "recently"...\nThen I'll have to work harder...!
出發吧，{{A}}！=Let's go, {{A}}!
抱歉沒能及時扶住你……=<size\=26>Sorry I couldn't catch you in time...</size>
對，對不起。我有點太急切了……=S-sorry. I was a little too eager...
{{A}}，雖然有幹勁是好事，\n但也得注意別浪費力氣哦。={{A}}, while it's good to be motivated, \nbe careful not to waste your energy.
沒錯。我們都知道，\nVIOLET你比任何人都努力。=Right. We all know that you work harder than anyone else, Violet.
誰也不知道我們什麼時候能逃出去，\n所以一定要放鬆心態。=We don't know when we'll get out of here, \nso it's crucial to stay relaxed.
一起加油吧=Let's keep it up
我也還是個新手呢=I'm still a beginner
好的！謝謝大家！\n下次不會浪費力氣了……我會繼續努力的！=Alright! Thank you, everyone! I won't waste my energy next time... I'll keep doing my best!
嗯，氣勢不錯。\n好了，那就繼續探索吧。=Yes, that's the spirit.\nNow, let's continue our exploration.
啊，那是吾輩的臺詞！\n你這個{{A}}，別搶吾輩臺詞！=Ah, that's my line! \nYou {{A}}, don't steal my line!
唔……這樣嗎？抱歉。=Hmm... Is that so? Sorry.
沒錯！你這個傢伙真是……嗯？=That's right! You really are... Huh?
怎麼回事，怎麼不像之前那樣罵回來了？=What's going on, why aren't you yelling back like before?
你說誰是{{A}}！！\n你這隻臭貓！！=Who are you calling {{A}}!!\nYou stinky cat!!
你現在才想起來啊！！=You just remembered now!!
到底是誰在浪費力氣……啊，\n你也說說他們吧？VIOLET。=Who's really wasting energy here... Ah, why don't you say something to them too, Violet?

……VIOLET，你沒事吧？\n好像來晚了點。=...Violet, are you okay? \nYou seem to be a little late.
沒，沒事！我可以的……=F-fine! I'm okay...
……一直這樣逞強的話，也不太好吧。\n畢竟難得有可靠的{{A}}在身邊。=...It's not good to act tough, is it? Especially since I have such reliable {{A}} around.
各位……很不好意思。\n我可以稍微休息一下嗎？=Everyone... I'm really sorry.\nCan I take a short break?
謝謝大家。\n那我就不客氣了……=Thank you. \nI'll take you up on that offer...
以後也儘管提出來=Feel free to speak up
我也累了=I'm tired too
嗯，很抱歉我們沒注意到。\n稍微休息一下吧。=Yes, sorry we didn't notice.\nLet's take a short break.
VIOLET。\n我想，你的疲勞感……=Violet.\nI think your fatigue...
不止是因為……還沒有適應{{A}}吧？=Is not just because... \nYou're not used to the {{A}}, is it?
……不愧是{{A}}。\n果然瞞不過偵探的眼睛……=...As expected from {{A}}. \nI can't hide anything from a detective's eyes...
那個，能稍微給我一點時間，\n讓我說幾句話嗎？=Umm, could you give me a moment? \nThere's something I'd like to say...
多久都可以=As long as you need
說出來聽聽=Let's hear it
嗯，這裡也感受不到陰影的氣息，\n坐下來聊一會吧。=Yes, I don't sense any Shadow's presence here.\nLet's sit down and talk for a while.
我們也需要恢復一下體力。\n暫時就在這裡休息吧。=We also need to recover our stamina. \nLet's rest here for now.
呼……稍微恢復一些了。=Phew... I feel a bit better now.
在{{A}}裡說「恢復」，\n好像有一點奇怪呢……=It's a bit strange to say "better" in the {{A}}...
最好能去安全屋之類的地方啊……\n不過，你感覺舒服一些了就好。=It'd be best if we could go to a safe room or something... But, I'm glad you're feeling better.
所以VIOLET，你要說什麼？=So Violet, what did you want to say?
……其實，我一直在想……\n我和{{A}}被引到這裡的原因。=...Actually, I've been thinking... \nAbout why {{A}} and I were led to here.
看起來，你有頭緒了？=It seems like you have some idea about it, don't you?
是的。雖然我的猜想可能不太對……=Yes. Although my guess may not be correct...
大家一起想想=<size\=27>Let's think about it together</size>
謝謝。\n那個，稍微有點難以啟齒……=Thank you.\nUmm, it's a bit hard to say...
我覺得「讓大家捲進來的原因」，\n可能就是我自己……=I think I might be "the reason why everyone got involved"...
之前我也有提到過吧？\n我有一件苦惱的事……=I mentioned it before, right? \nThere's something that's been troubling me...
我……一直想從那個境遇裡「逃出去」。=I... have always wanted to "escape" from that situation.
就是因為這個想法，我才會來到這裡……\n我猜，大家都被我的想法卷了進來……=It's because of that thought that I've came here... \nI think everyone got caught up in my thoughts...
不想待在現實世界，想逃到什麼地方去……\n捲進了這樣一個「願望」裡。=I "wish" to escape to somewhere where reality doesn't hurt...
可，可是，即便如此，\n人類被捲進{{A}}這種事……=B-but, even so, for humans to be dragged into the {{A}} like this...
但……也不是不可能。畢竟對我們來說，\n這個{{A}}本身，原本也是不可能的存在。=But... it's not impossible. For us, the idea of the {{A}} was already impossible.
「想要逃避現實的願望」……啊。="A wish to escape reality"...
難道吾在無意識中，\n也想逃離那個「噩夢」嗎……？=Could it be that I, too, unconsciously wanted to escape that "nightmare"...?
雖然我不覺得自己有這種力量，\n但「想逃避」的想法，應該只有我會有……=Although I don't think I possess such power, \nthe thought of "wanting to escape" is probably unique to me...
回想起來，這裡的陰影也一直在說……\n「逃避」之類的話。=Thinking back, the Shadows here have kept saying things like "escape".
唔……好像確實是這樣。=Hmm... That does seem to be the case.
可能是我消極的情緒，\n和這個空間產生了連接。=Perhaps my negative emotions have formed a connection to this space.
……明明應該勇敢面對的。\n我真是太沒用了。=...I should've faced it bravely. \nI'm so useless.
這很正常=That's normal
逃避就是壞事嗎？=Is escaping bad?
{{A}}，可是……那些不得不面對的事，\n我都假裝看不見呢？={{A}}, but... Those things that I have to face,\nI just pretend not to see them?
明明應該勇敢面對的吧。=I should've been brave enough to face them.
與，與其說壞事……那個……=R-rather than saying it's bad... That...
明明應該去做的事情，\n卻放著不管的話……=If you ignore something you should do...
我……從某種意義上來說……\n也一直在逃避。=I... In a way... \nHave also been escaping.
被強加無法自辯的罪名，失去容身之地……\n擺脫這種困境之前，我無法抗爭任何東西。=<size\=28>Being falsely accused, losing my place of belonging...\nUntil I escaped that situation, I couldn't resist anything.</size>
但是，也有一種東西，\n只有透過「逃避」才能獲得。=However, there are things that can only be obtained through "escaping".
只有逃避，才能獲得的東西……=Things that can only be obtained through escaping...
沒錯。可以說，怪盜這種職業，\n被追擊就是工作的一部分。=That's right, you could say for a Phantom Thief, being chased is part of the job.
為了避免被「不自由」抓住，\n吾輩們以後也要不斷華麗地逃跑哦！=To avoid being caught by "unfreedom",\nwe'll keep making graceful escapes!
「逃避」這個感覺和行為，\n也不全是壞事啊。=The feeling and act of "escaping" aren't entirely bad after all.
這是追求新環境的願望=<size\=27>It's a desire for new environments</size>
這是自我改變的慾望=<size\=27>It's a desire for self change</size>
WONDER說的沒錯。=Wonder is right.
如果一味接受糟糕的環境，不做任何抵抗，\n只會殺死自己的意志……=If you just accept the bad situation and don't resist at all, you will only kill your own will...
如果沒有「逃避」這個選項，\n我也什麼都改變不了。=If I didn't have the option to "escape",\nI couldn't have changed anything.
拋棄習慣的環境，既需要勇氣也需要力量。\n逃避絕不是一件簡單的事。=Abandoning a familiar environment takes both courage and strength. Escaping is never easy.
不過……原來如此。=But... I see.
如果「想逃避」的意志就是問題的關鍵，\n那一起被引過來的我，也是一樣的吧？=<size\=27>If the will to "escape" is the key to the problem,\nthen it's the same for me, who was led here, right?</size>
不，我完全沒有這個意思！\n{{A}}想要逃避……這完全不能想像。=No, I don't mean that at all! {{A}} wanting to escape... I can't imagine that.
{{A}}，開玩笑啦。={{A}}, just kidding.
「逃避」既是人類想要改變現狀的慾望，\n也是一種希望……="Escape" is both a human desire to change the status quo and hope...
應該可以這麼說吧。\n既然如此，我們就稱它為「{{A}}」吧。=You could say that. In that case, let's call it the "{{A}}".
直到現在，我從來沒想過「逃避也可以」。=Until now, I never thought that it was "okay to escape".
我一直以為去面對、去嘗試做些什麼，\n才是正確答案。=I always thought facing things and trying to do something was the correct answer.
逃避……原來也可以啊。=Escaping... Is okay after all.
VIOLET好像想通了……=Violet seems to have figured it out...
……「逃避」啊。=..."Escaping".
你想到什麼了嗎？=Think of something?
啊，我在想……\n她的猜想可能是對的。=Ah, I was thinking...\nHer guess might be right.
雖然我從來沒覺得自己在逃避什麼，\n但可能……也未必。=I didn't think I was escaping, \nbut maybe... in reality.
有什麼頭緒了嗎？=Any ideas?
……嗯，怎麼說呢。=...Well, how should I put it.
就算有，也不告訴你們。=Even if there is, I won't tell you.
哎呀，話都說到這了，就講一講吧……=No, you've already said this much, just say it...
可從這逃出去之後，就沒有任何記憶了吧？\n說了又有什麼用呢。=<size\=29>But once we escape from here, won't we lose all our memories? What's the point of saying anything?</size>
算了，也是……\n眼下最重要的，還是要儘快逃離這個{{A}}。=Well, that's true... The most important thing right now is to escape this {{A}} as soon as possible.
是的，吾也這麼想。=Yes, I agree.
這前面好像也有強敵的氣息……=There seems to be a presence of a strong enemy ahead...
為了「逃離」這個神秘的{{A}}，\n吾等繼續前進吧。=To "escape" from this mysterious {{A}},\nlet's keep moving forward.
切，耍什麼酷。\n你這傢伙還是跟逃跑更配。=Tch, stop acting so cool. \nEscaping suits you better.
你說什麼，你這隻臭貓！=What did you say, you stinky cat!
你這傢伙～～～！！=You～～～！！
又吵起來了……=Started fighting again...
一直沒什麼精神的CATTLE，\n看起來活力滿滿……=Cattle, who's been so listless, looks full of energy now...
那個，我早就想說了……=Umm, I've been meaning to say this for a while now...
你們2個也關係不錯吧……？=You two also get along well, don't you...?
怎麼可能！！=Impossible!!
好了，那休息時間就到此為止了。\n繼續前進吧。=Well, that's the end of the break time.\nLet's keep moving.
嗯，走吧！=Yes, let's go!

似乎必須打倒這只陰影才能前進呢……=It seems that we must defeat this Shadow to move forward...
WONDER，做好戰鬥的準備吧！=Wonder, ready for combat!
從前方傳來強大的陰影的氣息……=Ahead is the presence of a strong Shadow...

那邊的電網好像解除了。\n來吧，繼續前進吧。=The electric fence over there is disabled.\nCome on, let's keep moving.
這是新的區域，不要放鬆警惕。\n還有…… 也別錯過寶箱哦！=This is a new area, so keep your guard up. \nAnd... don't miss the treasure chests!
這扇門不是普通的門啊。是電子鎖嗎？\n不過，它應該是鎖著的吧。=It's not an ordinary door, is it an electric lock? \nBut it should be locked.
這扇門和其他門不一樣，戒備森嚴，\n說不定在這門後面藏著什麼重要的東西呢。=This door is not like the others, it's heavily guarded, maybe there's something important hidden behind it.
比如說，是能讓我們逃出去的辦法之類的。\n要是這樣的話不管怎樣都得想辦法開鎖才行。=For example, a way for us to escape. If that's the case, we'll have to find a way to unlock this.
從這個房間裡面…… 能聽到奇怪的聲音呢。\n滋滋滋的，就好像有「電流」在流動一樣。=I can hear a strange sound... from inside this room. It's like an electric buzzing sound.
雖然不知道這聲音到底是什麼，但看起來\n還是值得進去看看的。打開門試試吧。=I don't know what the sound is, but it looks like it's worth checking out. Let's open the door.
喂，你啊，{{A}}…… 根據以往的經驗，\n這扇門肯定不會那麼容易自己打開的吧？=Hey, you {{A}}... Based on past experience, surely this door won't open itself?
當，當然知道啦！吾想說的是\n吾等在附近找找線索！=O-of course I know! What I want to say is that we should look for clues nearby!
那個陰影……\n感覺像是在看守著開關呢。=That Shadow...\nFeels like it's guarding the switch.
那東西看起來能用得上，真想拿到手，\n但看來非得戰鬥不可了……=That looks useful, I want to get it, \nbut it seems combat is unavoidable...
那就只能戰鬥了。\n上吧，WONDER ！=Then we can only fight.\nLet's go, Wonder!
{{A}}……！ 這個顯示幕突然亮了……！={{A}}...! This display suddenly lit up...!
……變得幸福…… 逃避……=...Become happy... Escape...
……變得幸福…… 逃避……\n到底在說什麼啊。=...Become happy... Escape...\nWhat is this trying to say?
難道是某種密碼……？\n算了先不管了，WONDER ，吾等繼續前進吧。=Is it some kind of password...?\nNo matter, Wonder, let's keep moving.
向著夢想的…… 彼岸……=Towards the dream's... Shore...
哇！ 這扇門，有聲音！？=Wow! This door, is talking!?
和剛才聽到的聲音一樣啊……\n是在向吾輩索要什麼東西嗎……？=It's the same as the voice we heard earlier... \nIs it asking us for something...?
可能需要給出回應。比如說……\n剛才的語音就是密碼之類的。=A response may be required. For example... \nThe voice just now could be a password.
原來如此，是能用語音開鎖的系統啊。\nWONDER，能給出回應嗎？=I see, it's a voice unlock system.\nWonder, can you response?
噢，門打開了！\n多虧了CROW的推理和WONDER的機智！=Oh, the door is open! Thanks to Crow's deduction and Wonder's wit!
好，那吾等繼續前進吧！=Right, let's keep moving!
感覺到前方有強大陰影的氣息。=I feel a strong Shadow ahead.
要是在這裡戰鬥，就意味著探索結束了……=If we fight here, it means exploration is over...
怎麼樣，WONDER。準備好了嗎？=Well, Wonder. Ready?

這裡也是…… 相當廣闊的地方呢。=This is also... a fairly vast area.
是啊，而且越往深處走，\n強大的陰影氣息就越近。=Yeah, and the deeper we go, \nthe closer the powerful Shadow's presence gets.
說不定能成為逃脫的線索。\n走吧，WONDER。=Maybe that will be a clue to escape.\nLet's go, Wonder.
啊……！\n那邊的門，又是特殊形狀的……！=Ah...!\nThe door over there has a special shape.
也就是說。我們又得去尋找\n打開這扇門的線索了，是吧？=That is to say. We'll have to look for clues to open this door again, correct?
切，快點去追蹤吾輩察覺到的\n那個特殊暗影的氣息……=Tch, hurry up and track the presence of that special Shadow I sensed...
沒辦法啦，千里之行始於足下嘛。\n開鎖和搜索敵人，吾等同時進行吧。=It can't be helped, a journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step. Let's unlock the door and search for that enemy simultaneously.
太好了，找到了。\n吾等感知到的特殊陰影……=Great, found it. \nThat special Shadow I sensed...
擊敗這個陰影之後，\n很快就可以逃離{{A}}……了吧？=After defeating this Shadow, \nwe can escape the {{A}} soon... Right?
也許吧。我們正在嘗試的……\n是一種前所未有的逃脫方式。=Maybe. Right now we're trying... \nan unprecedented escape method.
一定能逃出去=Will definitely escape
現在只能選擇相信了=Can only believe now
沒錯，現在別無他法。\n只能試試看了。=Right, there is no other way now.\nWe will just have to try.
強敵的氣息也逐漸減弱了。\n無論如何，應該是有些進展的。=<size\=30>The presence of strong enemies have decreased considerably. We should be making some progress.</size>
大家上吧！=Let's go, everybody!
太好了，贏了！=All right, that's done!
嗯，剩下的強大陰影氣息……\n應該只有「１個」了。=Hmm, there seems to be... \nOnly "one" powerful Shadow left.
也就是說……=That is to say...
是這個{{A}}的「核心」=It's the {{A}}'s "Core"
打倒它就能逃脫了?=<size\=24>Defeating it will let us escape?</size>
應該沒錯了……！想到接下來就是最後一戰，\n忽然有點緊張起來了。=That's right...! I'm getting a little nervous thinking about the final battle.
別擔心。大家齊心協力，\n無論什麼對手都能打敗。=Don't worry. If we work together, \nwe can defeat any opponent.
CROW，走吧？=Crow, let's go?
好，沒問題。=Yes, no problem.
嗯？怎麼了。=Hmm? What's wrong?
……沒事，沒什麼。\n走吧。=...No, it's nothing.\nLet's go.

剛才打倒那個強大的陰影之後，\n好像又出現了一股強大的氣息。=After defeating that powerful Shadow, it seems that a strong presence has appeared again.
嗯，但感覺這股氣息是從下層傳來的。\n它是怎麼移動的呢…=Hmm, but it feels like it's coming from the lower levels. how is it moving...
說不定，和我們一路走來的路線不同，\n還有別的通道。=Perhaps there are other passages that are different from the route we have taken.
比如說利用那邊的繩子，\n或許就能前往新的區域。=For example, by using the rope over there, \nmaybe we can go to a new area.
哦，這是個好主意。\n總之找找移動的方法吧，WONDER。=Oh, that's a good idea. \nAnyway, let's find a way to move, Wonder.
啊……！剛才的聲音是不是太大了點……！\n被陰影發現了嗎……？=Ah...! Was that too loud...!\nDid the Shadow noticed...?
好像是呢。不過幸運的是，\n敵人似乎還不知道我們的具體位置。=It seems so. Luckily, the enemy doesn't seem to know exactly where we are.
那吾等就應該把這當作一個機會。\n跳下去打倒敵人吧，WONDER！=Then we should take this as an opportunity to ambush the enemy, Wonder!
從痛苦中…… 解脫……=Free... From pain...
這個語音…… 又是密碼吧。\n對著門試試，WONDER=This voice... It's the password again.\nTry it on the door, Wonder.
嗚噢！ 這裡的電網也太多了吧！？=Wow! That's too many electric fences!?
門好像也被堵住了，\n看來除了解除電網繼續前進，沒有別的辦法了=The door seems to be blocked too, so there's no other way to proceed but to disable these.
那邊有個機器人！ 再用它來\n試試解除電網怎麼樣？=There's a robot over there! \nHow about using it to disable the fences?
吾同意這個意見。\n交給你來操作了，WONDER=I agree. I'll leave it to you, Wonder.
從現實中…… 超脫……=Detach... From reality...
從剛才開始就不明白這些話是什麼意思……\n到底是什麼線索呢……=I haven't understood what these words mean from the start... What exactly is the clue...
難道是想給我們什麼啟示嗎。\n…… 真讓人不舒服。=Is it trying to give us some revelation.\n...It's really uncomfortable.
不管怎樣，試著回答看看吧。\n就靠你了，WONDER=Anyway, try to answer it. \nI'm counting on you, Wonder.
幹得好。那吾等繼續前進吧！=Well done, let's keep moving!

這個地方的氛圍…… 總覺得有點可怕呢……\n那邊發光的門也很詭異……=The atmosphere of this place... feels a bit scary... That glowing door over there is also weird...
嗯，這個{{A}}到底……\n是仿照什麼建造的呢……=Hmm, what exactly... \nIs this {{A}} built after...
想太多也沒用，現在先繼續前進吧。\n敵人也越來越強了，要一邊警戒一邊走=It's useless to think too much, let's just keep moving. The enemies are getting stronger and stronger, stay alert.
切，開關被陰影監視著嗎。\n看來無法避免戰鬥了……=Tch, the switch is being watched by the Shadow. \nIt seems that there is no way to avoid combat...
怎麼辦，WONDER。\n做好戰鬥準備了嗎？=What to do, Wonder.\nReady for combat?
唔…… 又出現奇怪的陰影了。\n雖然不知道這傢伙是不是逃脫的關鍵…=Hmm... It's a strange Shadow again. Although I don't know if this guy is the key to escape...
既然吾輩被困在這裡，\n就不能放任不管。上吧，大家！=Now that we are trapped here, we cannot just do nothing. Let's go, everyone!
好，成功了。但是……\n還是覺得這個地方有點不對勁。=Good, we did it. But... I still feel like there's something wrong with this place.
那我們仔細調查一下這附近吧。\n說不定這和逃脫有關呢！=Then let's investigate nearby. \nMaybe it has something to do with escaping!

唔…… 大致調查過了，\n但還是不明白那種違和感究竟是怎麼回事……=Hmm... That's most areas explored, but I still don't understand what the dissonance is...
說不定有什麼地方被我們忽略了。\n比如說……「秘密通道」之類的。=Maybe there's something we've overlooked. \nFor example... a "secret passage".
原來如此，有秘密通道嗎……！\nWONDER，順著這個通道再找找看吧。=I see, a secret passage...! \nWonder, let's look for it along this passage.
哇，上面居然有這樣一條路……！=Wow, there's actually a path up here...!
那邊還能看到個像是開關的東西。根據\n之前的探索經驗，這東西應該能派上用場。=There's also what looks like a switch. Based on previous explorations, it should come in handy.
嗯，看樣子也沒有其他路了。\n先往那個開關的方向過去看看吧。=Hmm, I don't think there's any other way. \nLet's go to the direction of that switch first.
不過這裡也有電網……\nWONDER，先把這個解除掉吧。=But there is an electric fence...\nWonder, let's disable that first.
哦，門好像開了！\n果然這個開關就是開鎖的關鍵啊。=Oh, the door seems to be open! \nThis switch is the key to unlocking the door!
那我們趕緊去看看打開的房間吧！=Then let's hurry to that opened room!
但要小心。吾感覺到有強大陰影的氣息。\n千萬不能放鬆警惕。=But be careful. I sense the presence of a strong Shadow. Don't let your guard down.
果然這裡也被陰影擋住了……\n沒辦法避免戰鬥了……=As expected, this place is also blocked by a Shadow... There is no way to avoid combat...
能行嗎，WONDER？=Ready, Wonder?
答案是……“接納”……=The answer is... "Acceptance"...
又是語音密碼嗎……？雖然不知道\n是什麼意思，但先去打開那扇大門吧。=It's a password again...? I don't know what it means, but let's go open that door first.
逃避才是…… 真實……=Escape is... The truth...
逃避…… 又是這個詞……=Escape... It's that word again...
意味深長啊，但也別想得太多了。\n現在還是優先繼續前進吧。=It means a lot, but don't overthink it. \nLet's prioritize moving forward for now.
這大概就是最後一扇門了。\nWONDER，就靠你破解密碼了。=This is probably the last door. \nWonder, it's up to you to crack the code.
好，打開了！ 走到這裡可真不容易……\n稍微休息一下再繼續前進吧。=Yes, it's open! It's not easy to get here...\nLet's take a short break before moving on.

有種奇怪的氣息……\n這裡面，很可能就是讓這個{{A}}形成的傢伙。=This strange presence.... There's a good chance that someone in there is the one who formed this fake {{A}}.
沒錯，臭氣熏天。\n而且感覺是個勁敵，要加把勁了。=Yeah, it smells. \nAnd it feels like a formidable enemy, get ready.
你們覺得前方的陰影……\n就是{{A}}的核心……對吧。=You guys think this Shadow ahead...\nIs the Core of this {{A}}... right?
嗯，吾沒有感受到其他類似核心的氣息，\n也沒有其他強敵了。=Yes, I don't feel any other Core-like presence, \nand there are no other strong enemies.
那就上吧=Then let's go
打倒根源逃離這裡吧=<size\=25>Defeat the source and escape</size>
等等。在這之前……\n以防萬一，我確認一下。=Wait. Before that... \nJust in case, I'll confirm something.
VIOLET，你可以嗎？=Violet, is this okay?
{{A}}……？我嗎……？={{A}}...? Me...?
不，不好意思……\n{{A}}的意思是……=S-sorry...\n{{A}} means...
打倒前方的強敵，\n就有可能從這裡逃脫。=If we defeat the strong enemy ahead, \nwe might be able to escape from here.
但是，這……\n和「你」希望的不是正相反嗎？=But isn't this... \nThe exact opposite of "your" wish?
沒問題。=No problem.
我的確一直想逃避。從痛苦的現實裡，\n從巨大的壓力裡，當然……可能還有別的……=I have always wanted to escape. From the painful reality, from the enormous pressure, and of course... maybe other things too...
但是，如今我明白了「逃避也沒關係」。=But now I understand that "it's okay to escape".
比起以前那個「認為不能逃避」的自己，\n現在這個「逃避也沒關係」的自己……=Compared to my older self who believed "you must never escape", the current self who accepted that "it's okay to escape" is...
更加強大！=More powerful!
所以，就算回到現實……我也不會被擊垮的！=So, even if I return to reality... I won't lose!
從VIOLET身上，\n感受到了強大的生命力……！=Feeling a strong vitality from Violet...!
看來你好像想通了。=Looks like you've figured it out.
嗯，看著VIOLET現在活力滿滿的樣子，\n吾輩們心情也變好了！=Yes, seeing Violet full of energy now,\nour mood has also improved!
……有了逃避這個選項之後，\n好像內心反而有了底氣。=...So does having the option to escape mean you've gained inner strength?
CATTLE也高興了=Cattle is happy too
CATTLE也一樣吧=Cattle is the same
吾？不，吾沒有任何變化。\n從開始到現在，吾一直都活力滿滿！=Me? No, I haven't changed a bit. \nI've been full of energy since the start!
你這傢伙真不會說謊……\n你沒發現自己一直很奇怪嗎？=You really can't lie... \nDon't you realize you've been acting strange?
什麼！？哪、哪裡奇怪！\n完全、一點也不奇怪好嗎！=What? S-strange!\nNo, not strange at all!
你別挑事了！=Stop making false accusations!
算了算了。\n無論誰被戳中痛處都會尷尬的。=Forget it. Anyone can feel awkward if someone points something out to them.
吾不是說了嗎！吾好得很！\n你們有沒有聽吾說話！喂！=Didn't I tell you, I'm fine! \nAre you listening to me?
沒錯。你可能自己沒意識到，\n但你從一開始就怪怪的。=That's right. You probably didn't notice, but you've been acting strange from the start.
才，才沒有呢！\n吾正常得不得了！一如既往！=N-no! \nI'm perfectly normal! As usual!
你有什麼苦惱嗎，說來聽聽？=If you have any worries, let me know.
大家都很可靠，說出來也是一種解決辦法哦！\n{{A}}！=Everyone is very reliable, so why not try talking to them? {{A}}!
吾不是說了沒什麼嗎！\n吾好得很！好、得、很！=Didn't I say it's nothing! \nI'm fine! Fine!
比起這個，吾等更應該集中精神面對敵人！\n再不做點什麼的話，可就逃不出去了！=More importantly, we should concentrate on facing the enemy! If we don't do something, we won't be able to escape!
{{A}}，掩飾害羞的方式也這麼笨拙。={{A}}, you're also clumsy at hiding your embarrassment.
CATTLE說的確實是當務之急。=What Cattle said is indeed the top priority.
另外還要多加小心。\n打倒這個敵人之後，{{A}}可能就會崩塌。=Also be careful, the {{A}} may collapse after we defeat this enemy.
好了，走吧！=Alright, let's go!
一起回到現實吧！=<size\=24>Let's return to reality together!</size>
果然在這……！=Here...!
原來如此，跟之前的陰影氣息完全不一樣。\n看來會是一場苦戰。=I see. It's a different kind of Shadow presence than before, looks like it's going to be a tough fight.
{{A}}，怕了嗎？={{A}}, scared?
怎麼可能。\n你才是，準備好了嗎？=Impossible.\nThat's you. Ready?
當然，上吧！=Of course, let's go!

為什麼拔刀相向……=Why draw your sword against me...
我……「我們」……\n為了你們這些傢伙……=I... "We"...\nFor you all...
……？\n他到底在說什麼……？=...?\nWhat is he talking about...?
接受自我的意志吧！=Accept the will of the self!
什麼，這些傢伙……！？\n分裂了，給每個人賦予了某種力量……？=What, this guy...!?\nSplit and gave everyone some kind of power...?
這可能是大規模攻擊的前兆。\n先試著驅散每個敵人被賦予的力量吧！=<size\=30>This could be the precursor to a massive attack, try to dispel the power given to each enemy first!</size>
哼，雖然受到了攻擊，但並沒有什麼威力啊。=Hmm, despite attacked, it wasn't very powerful.
果然，驅散每個敵人身上的力量才是正確的做法。\n就照這個方向，大家繼續上吧！=<size\=29>Sure enough, dispelling the power of each enemy was the right move. Let's continue in this direction!</size>
{{A}}……！相當強力的傷害啊……\n大家都沒事吧！？={{A}}...! Quite powerful damage...\Is everyone ok!?
果然是因為賦予了分身力量嗎……\n抱歉，下次一定會驅散掉的！=Is it because they gave the clones power...\nSorry, I'll dispel it next time!
注意到了嗎，WONDER？感覺到\n那些傢伙的弱點發生了變化。先調查一下吧。=Noticed that, Wonder? I can feel the enemies' weaknesses have changed. Let's investigate.

呼，呼……\n我們做、做到了……！=P-phew...\nWe did it...!
雖然設法取勝了……=While it's good that we managed to defeat them...
嗯。與以往不同，\n{{A}}好像……並沒有崩塌的跡象。=Hmm. Unlike in the past, the {{A}} doesn't seem to...  show signs of a collapse.
……接……接受吧……=...Acc... Accept...
好像沒能徹底擊殺啊。\n讓我給他最後一擊……=Seems like we didn't defeat them completely. \nI'll finish them off...
等等，CROW。=Wait, Crow.
如果……不繼續……做夢的話……\n那就……接……受吧……=If... you don't continue... to dream...\nThen... acc... accept...
接受……自我……逃避……=Accept... Self... Escape...
「自我逃避」……？\n喂，你這傢伙到底在說什麼……="Self escape"...?\nHey, what are you talking about...
接……接受吧……=Acc... Accept...
陰影好像一直在重複同樣的話……=The Shadow seems to keep repeating the same words....
……好像無法交流。\n這傢伙已經喪失自我了……=...Can't communicate at all. \nThis guy has lost themself...
應該是被吾等擊潰之後，\n他的一縷意識殘留在了這裡。=After we defeat them, a piece of their consciousness was left here.
「接受逃避」……啊。="Accept escape"... huh.
究竟是什麼意思呢……=What does it mean...
VIOLET的想法好像是對的。\n雖然沒有……百分百全對。=Maybe Violet's theory was right. \nThough... it's not perfect.
是指想要逃避的意志？=<size\=30>You mean the will to escape?</size>
回想起來，VIOLET一開始覺得，\n逃避是「壞事」，對吧？=Remember, Violet initially felt that escaping was "wrong", right?
但是在WONDER和JOKER的鼓勵下，\n你意識到「逃避」也是一種選擇。=But with the advice of Wonder and Joker, you realized that "escaping" is also an option.
沒錯。多虧了大家，\n我才改變了想法……！=That's right. Thanks to everyone,\nI've changed my mind...
但是……聽這個陰影的意思，\n逃離這裡的要素不止這一點。=But... from what this Shadow said, it seems like that alone isn't enough to help with escape.
接受自我逃避。\n不只是認識到「逃避也沒關係」……=Accepting self escape. Not just about knowing that "it's okay to escape"...
還要正面「接受」那個想要逃避的自己。=But about "accepting" the part of you that wants to escape head on.
接受……想要逃避的自己……=Accepting... the part of you that wants to escape...
也就是說……\n讓自己身上的新慾望萌芽……？=In other words...\nIt is the budding of a new desire...?
等等。仔細想想，\n迄今為止所有的融合{{A}}好像都是這樣……=Wait, come to think of it, ihat idea may also apply to previous fusion {{A}}s...
目前為止的所有{{A}}？=All the {{A}}s so far?
都是哪樣？=Like what?
「針對某種東西抱有強烈的慾望」……\n這就是關鍵的共同之處。="To have some strong desire"...That's the common denominator.
回過頭想想，吾等與JOKER他們，\n都有強烈的互相合作、共同逃離的慾望對吧？=Thinking back, I think that we, Joker, and the others, had a strong desire to cooperate and escape together, right?
……應該，是吧……=...That may be so, but...
等等。也就是說……盜取核心{{A}}，\n本來就不是「正確的逃脫方法」……=Wait. That is to say... Stealing the Core {{A}} was actually not the "legitimate means of escape"...
反而是盜取核心{{B}}這個行為，\n「強行解除了」{{A}}的融合？=Does this mean that the fusion {{A}} was "forcibly deactivated" by stealing the Core?
……可能是這樣。要驗證這個猜想，\n吾等需要試試接下來這個方法。=...That may be so. To prove it, I want to try what I'm about to say.
假設這個{{A}}持有「{{B}}」，\n那麼如果吾等接納它，會發生什麼呢……？=Assuming that this {{A}} holds the "{{B}}", what would happen if we accepted it...?
也就是「接受想要逃避的自己」……\n對吧。=That would be "accepting the part of you that wants to escape"... Right?
沒錯，我一直……都在逃避。=That's right, I've been... escaping.
除了藝術體操，我逃避了很多重要的事……\n但這樣子的自己……也是「我」的一部分……=I run away from many important things besides rhythmic gymnastics... But this kind of self... is also part of "me"...
認識到自己在逃避這件事，\n也許就是向前邁進的關鍵一步。=Recognizing that you are escaping from this,\nmaybe that's a crucial step in moving forward.
所以我願意接受。接受過去不斷逃避的自己，\n也接受未來的自己……！=So I accept myself. The person I was escaping from, and the person I will be from now on...!
沒錯，吾在內心的某個角落……\n可能也選擇了逃避。=That's right, maybe somewhere in my heart...\nI was also escaping.
但吾願意接受那樣的自己……\n接受新的慾望。=But I'm willing to accept myself as I am... \nAccepting new desires.
吾要把WONDER和同伴們……\n從噩夢般的場景裡拯救出來……！=I will save Wonder and his teammates...\nFrom that nightmarish scene...!
逃避既是追求變化的意志，\n也是邁向光明未來的勇氣。=Escape is both the will to pursue change and the courage to step toward a brighter future.
想要逃避的這個想法，可能也是自己身上重要的「慾望」之一……=The idea to escape, might also be one of my most important "desires"...
喂，快看！\n那個陰影！=Hey, look!\nThat Shadow!
接受……了……啊……=Accepted... it... ah...
聽上去……他判定我們「接受了」{{A}}。=From those words... He judged that we've "accepted" the {{A}}.
應該是。=Maybe.
但是，那傢伙消失之後，\n這個空間也沒有崩塌……=However, after that guy disappeared, this space did not collapse...
不過入口那邊奇怪的氣息消失了。\n現在說不定能逃出去。=But the strange presence at the entrance has disappeared, we might be able to escape now.
那我們快過去吧！=Then let's go over there quickly!
哦哦，似乎真的可以出去了！\n{{A}}竟然猜對了，可真罕見啊。=Ohhh, it looks like we can actually leave! \n{{A}} got it right, that's rare.
你這傢伙……！\n還是那麼嘴硬。=You...!\nStill as talkative as ever.
那……我們快逃出去吧。\n但在那之前……=Well... Let's escape.\nBut before that...
真的很對不起大家！=I'm really sorry everyone!
歸根到底，這裡產生的原因……\n應該就是我「想要逃避」的想法。=In the end, I think it was my desire to "escape" that got the better of me.
不，並不是只有你。雖然很慚愧，\n但吾也有……此種想法。=No, you're not the only one. I'm ashamed to say... that I had the same thought.
吾等都有所領悟，獲得了全新的慾望。\n這次不也收穫頗豐嗎？=We were able to gain new insights and new desires from each other. Isn't that fruitful?
{{A}}……\n嗯，謝謝你！={{A}}...\nYes, thank you!
CROW，你怎麼了？=Crow, what's wrong?
你在想什麼？=What are you thinking?
我從自己的角度推測了一下，\n形成這種{{A}}的原因。=I was speculating on my own on how this {{A}} came into being.
如果像CATTLE猜測的那樣，\n「擁有慾望」就是逃離這裡的條件……=Even if we assume that having desire is the condition for escaping, as Cattle predicted...
那引發這種現象的犯人，\n究竟有什麼目的呢。=What was the goal of the culprit of this crime?
……的確。=...Indeed.
對吾輩和JOKER來說，這已經是第4次，\n不能算是偶然事件了。=This is already the fourth time for me and Joker, it can't be chalked up to a coincidence.
雖然吾之前進行過調查……\n但最終沒能找到答案。=I've looked into this before... \nBut I never found the answer.
……前3次，只要盜取核心，\n就可以逃離融合世界。=...The previous three times, it was possible to escape from the fused world by stealing the Core.
但這次並不存在什麼核心。\n那麼到上次為止，都是「異常現象」嗎？=If the Core itself doesn't exist this time, then perhaps the previous events were "anomalies"?
我在想，犯人是不是並沒有料到……\n「偷取核心就能逃離」呢。=I think the culprit probably never expected... \n"Stealing the Core as a means of escape".
所以這次要防止核心被偷取。\n不知道是被藏了起來，還是原本就不存在。=So this time, they tried to prevent the Core from being stolen. I don't know if it was hidden or if it doesn't even exist.
也許從一開始，逃離的必要條件……\n就是讓人「擁有某種慾望」。=To achieve what was originally necessary for escape... Is to create some kind of desire.
嗯……也就是說，這個地方……=Hmm... This place where we gather...
希望我們和其他怪盜{{A}}擁有慾望嗎？=The goal was to make us and the other Phantom Thieves {{A}} have desires?
我不確定。而且，\n還有些事可能也與「慾望」有關。I can't be sure. Though, there are other points that seem to involve "desires".
JOKER、WONDER。\n你們明白我的意思吧？=Joker, Wonder. \nYou guys understand what I mean?
我們的世界和WONDER他們的世界，\n擁有相同「慾望」時，就會發生的事……？=This is our world and the world of Wonder's. This phenomenon occurred when we had the same desire...?
比如，當兩個世界都處於……\n「開始探索{{A}}的時候」。=For example, when both worlds are...\n"Starting {{A}} exploration".
確實如此……=That's true...
想起來了，是的=I remembered, yes
不愧是你們呢。\n沒錯，我也是這麼想的。=As expected from you two.\nYes, I was thinking the same thing.
也就是說，形成這裡必不可少的東西，\n除了核心之外，還有兩個世界「認知同頻」。=In order to form this world, the existence of a Core and the "perceptions synchronization" of each other's world were necessary.
比如這一次……\n認知世界是因為「{{A}}」而融合。=In this case, for example... This cognitive world is fused through the "{{A}}".
兩個世界「認知同頻」……\n是啊，如此一想，確實有道理。="Perceptions synchronization" of both worlds... I see, if you think about it like that, it certainly makes sense.
所以我推斷……=From that I deduced...
除了讓人擁有慾望，\n或許犯人還有其他「目的」。=The culprit may have had another "purpose" besides inspiring desires.
其他的目的……嗎？=Another purpose...?
嗯。比如說……\n「需要讓兩個世界持續連接」……之類的。=Yes. For example... \n"A need to continue connecting the two worlds"...
讓兩個世界……持續連接？\n這究竟是為何？=A need to continue... connecting the two worlds?\nWhy is this?
誰知道呢，我還沒想出答案。\n但假如真是這樣的話……=Who knows, I haven't figured out that out yet.\nBut if we assume that is true...
犯人的目的已經達成了。\n因為這次的認知世界並沒有崩塌呢。=The culprit's goal has been accomplished.\nBecause this world did not collapse this time.
再進一步推理就比較困難了。\n離開這個世界後，記憶也會消失對吧？=Whatever we do, it seems like it'll be difficult to deduce anything further. When we leave this world, our memories disappear, right?
啊……！不、不好意思。因為知道能離開，\n好像就放鬆下來了，肚子就……！=Ah...! S-sorry. I was so relieved to be able to leave that my stomach...!
{{A}}，沒關係。大家都會肚子餓的，\n我們也不會一直待在這裡……={{A}}, don't worry. I'm also hungry and we can't be here forever...
我的推理，就到此為止了。=That's the end of my deduction.
啊，無論如何，吾輩們先逃離這裡吧。\n我們能離開的時機說不定只有現在。=Ah, in any case, let's get out of here.\nMaybe now is the only time we can leave.
不過，吾相當佩服CROW的觀察力啊……=But, I am impressed with Crow's observation skills...
怎麼樣，要不要加入吾等的{{A}}？=So, how about joining our {{A}}?
{{A}}，這個時候來挖人？\n有點不太好吧……={{A}}, scouting at a time like this?\nThat's a bit...
{{A}}！\n{{B}}好愛開玩笑呢！={{A}}!\n{{B}} loves joking!
WONDER。\n這次也多虧你了。=Wonder.\nThank you again.
這次也多謝了=Thanks for this time
其實……我有一些話沒對大家說……=Actually... I couldn't tell everyone...
在我內心的某個地方，\n可能也存在想要「逃避」現狀的想法。=Maybe somewhere in my heart, \nI wanted to "escape" from my current situation.
JOKER也會這樣？=Even Joker?
這些話不像你的風格=<size\=27>This doesn't sound like you</size>
呼……被你這麼一說，\n我倒是多了些勇氣。=Phew... I feel like I get courage when you say that to me.
多謝了。=Thank you.
我們正在攻略一座「像是賭場的{{A}}」。=We are exploring a "{{A}} that looks like a casino".
等作戰結束後……\n大家再相見吧。=Let's meet again... \nWhen the battle is over.
像是賭場的{{A}}……？=A {{A}} that looks like a casino...?
該不會是，那個夢的……=Could it be, that dream's...
喂，WONDER。你在幹什麼呢？=Hey, Wonder. What are you doing?

對了……之後我會忘記2位{{A}}對吧，\n明明受了你們那麼多照顧，真可惜。=Right... I will forgotten about Cattle-senpai and Wonder-senpai, even though they took care of me.
吾等也是，VIOLET。\n沒關係……只要有緣分，吾等還會再見的。=Thank you, Violet. It's okay... If fate allows, we may meet again.
不過這還是第一次如此平靜地告別呢……But this is the first time we said goodbye this peacefully...
之前每次都是驚慌失措地逃跑……=Before, we always escaped in panic...
話雖如此，現在也不能太過悠閒吧？\n也許現在就是唯一能逃脫的時機。=Having said that, we can't be too relaxed now, right? This might be the only chance we can escape.
說的對……吾等快走吧！=That's right... Let's go!
那就再見啦。大家後會有期！=This is goodbye. See you again!
……下次再見，嗎。=...See you again?
{{A}}，沒什麼特別的意思。={{A}}, there's no deeper meaning to it.
希望下次還能見面。\n再見。=I hope to see you again.\nGoodbye.

剛剛是想做什麼來著……？=What was I trying to do...?
唔，你怎麼了，一副呆呆的樣子。=Hmm, what's wrong? You're spacing out.
手機出什麼問題了嗎？=Something wrong with your phone?
手機畫面沒什麼異常。\n這種奇怪的感覺……是錯覺嗎？=The phone looks normal. This strange feeling... Is it an illusion?
抱歉，讓你擔心了啊。\n到了{{A}}，吾的心情完全平靜下來了。=I'm sorry to have worried you. By the time we got to {{A}}, I had calmed down completely.
真不可思議啊……\n之前那會兒心裡明明亂糟糟的。=It's strange... Even though my heart was in such a frenzy.
對了……剛剛來{{B}}，\n是為了讓{{A}}散散心……=Right... We came to {{B}} to help {{A}} relax...
sr:"^胸口煩悶的感覺好像已經徹底散去了。\n謝謝你啊，(.*)。$"="It's like something has been weighing down on my chest has been lifted. Thank you, $1."
唔……這麼一想，\n肚子就餓了呢。=Hmm... When I think about it,\nI'm hungry.
吾今天想吃滷蛋和紅燒肉！=I want to eat soy eggs and char siu today!
sr:"^(.*)！快帶吾去(.*)！$"="$1! Take me to $2!"

火災發生的時候，我碰巧1個人……\n在著火的房子裡，拼命尋找他們的身影。=When the fire broke out, I happened to be alone... I desperately looked for them in the burning house.
否則，我就……=Otherwise, I will...
雖然我理解你的心情……=<size\=25>Although I understand your feelings...</size>
你太逞強了=You're overdoing it
你應該更加珍惜自己一些=<size\=27>You should cherish yourself more</size>

在那裡和{{A}}分別了……=Left {{A}}...

sr:"^(.*)是你啊……\n抱歉，今天不會去巡邏。$"="$1, it's you...\nSorry, but I'm not on patrol today."
你也別管我了，\n早點回家比較好。=You should just ignore me and go home early sometimes.
追問{{A}}是不是在隱瞞什麼……=Ask {{A}} if they are hiding something...
不肯作罷=Refuse to give up
老老實實回家=Just go home
嗯，這樣才對。再見啦。=Yes, that's right. See you later.
……真是的，輸給你了。\n居然這麼輕易就被你看出來了。=...Really, I lost to you. \nI can't believe you saw through me so easily.
我也的確不擅長隱瞞……\n知道了，我會老老實實告訴你的。=I'm not good at keeping secrets... \nI get it, I'll be honest with you.
其實……從之前可疑火災發生的時候開始，\n有件事我一直很在意。=Actually... There's something that's been bothering me ever since that suspicious fire.
你還記得嗎？\n我一開始說「焦臭味」的時候……=Do you remember? \nWhen I first said "burnt smell"...
我覺得那並不是火源處飄過來的煙味。=I don't think that smell was the smoke coming from the fire.
味道是哪裡傳來的……？=<size\=27>Where did the smell come from...?</size>
這樣下去，\n總有一天真的會演變成大火災的……=If this continues, \none day there will be a really big fire...
那個時候，\n我們和一位行人擦肩而過了，對吧？=At that time, \nwe passed a passerby, right?
現在想起來，最開始聞到的焦臭味，\n好像是從當時那個人身上散發出來的。=Thinking back now, the first thing I noticed was a burnt smell coming from that person.
在那之後，\n我聞到了火源處飄過來的煙味……=But then, \nI smelled the smoke coming from the fire...
也就被那邊吸引了注意力，\n把最初感覺到的焦臭味給忘掉了。=I was so distracted that I forgot the burnt smell \nI first noticed.
後來我心裡一直有種奇怪的感覺……\n事後回想一下，就注意到了這件事。=But the strange feeling remained...\nI realized it later on when I thought back on it.
是怎麼一回事？=What's going on?
那該不會……！=Wouldn't that be...!
……說明那時候與我們擦肩而過的那個人，\n可能正是縱火的犯人。=...The person who passed by at that time may have been the arsonist.
所以，在那之後，\n我也在尋找當時的那個人。=So, I've been searching for that passerby ever since.
原本在擦肩而過的時候，\n就感覺對方看起來似乎有點眼熟……=When we passed each other, I felt like I had seen his face somewhere before...
現在我還在努力地回想一些細節。=Right now, I'm trying to remember those memories in detail.
可是……怎麼也想不起來。\n老實說，的確陷入了困境。=But I can't quite remember it, \nand to be honest, I'm struggling.
要怎麼才能想起來？=How to remember?
給腦子一些刺激？=Stimulate the brain?
我有個想法。\n……你跟我來一下。=I have an idea.\n...Follow me.
……讓你久等了。=...Sorry to keep you waiting.
這些紙箱是？=What are these boxes?
你要搬家嗎？=Are you moving?
我把在那個購物網站上買的東西帶過來了，\n這些都是送到我家快遞櫃裡的東西。=I brought the items I bought from that online store, these are all delivered in parcel boxes.
看起來能對回憶有幫助的東西，\n我都照著買了一遍。=I ordered everything I could find that might help with remembering.
我想一個個試試看，\n你也來幫忙。=I'm going to try them one by one now.\nYou help too.
……我都和你坦白這麼多了，\n你要陪我一起才可以。=...Since I've told you this much, \nI want you to join me.
先試試這個，\n聽說這是「記憶充能飲料」。=First up, this "Memory Charge" drink.
喝了這個，就能激發記憶力，\n能夠想起之前忘記的事情……好像是這樣。=Apparently... If you drink this, you can activate your memory and remember forgotten things.
好可疑……=Very suspicious...
太可疑了……=Too suspicious...
我明白，我沒抱什麼希望，\n但是，也只能試試看了。=I'm aware of that, \nbut I have to try it even if it might not work.
我……我先稍微喝點嘗嘗啦。=Well then... I'll try drinking some.
……嗚！=...Ugh!
……好難喝。非常難喝。=...It's bad. Very bad.
難喝……=It's bad...
看起來是真的很難喝……=Looks like it's really bad...
都到這一步了，加油啊！=<size\=28>We've come this far, keep it up!</size>
……說的是呢，\n包裝上也沒說需要全部喝完。=...You're right, \nit didn't say you need to drink it all.
說的、是呢……\n我知道了，我會努力的。=That's right...\nI understand. I'll do my best.
……不管喝幾次，還是覺得難喝。=...Whatever it is, it's bad.
想起來了嗎？=Remember?
太難喝了，根本就沒心思去回憶……=It was so bad that I couldn't focus on remembering...
接下來是這個。\n似乎是……促進記憶力的磁力貼布。=Next is this. It seems to be... a magnetic patch that improves memory.
別露出這種表情嘛……\n我也是抱著死馬當作活馬醫的想法。=Don't make that face...\nI'm grasping at straws too.
把這個貼在背上，\n刺激記憶的穴位……=Apply it to the acupressure points on your back to stimulate your memories...
……有點搆不著。\n我本以為自己的柔韌性還不錯的。=...It's a little out of reach. \nI thought I had a flexible body.
真沒辦法。你來貼吧。=It can't be helped. You apply it.
好啦，快點。=Come on, hurry up.
……嗯。有點癢。=...Hmm. It tickles.
按照{{A}}的要求，\n把磁力貼布貼到了她的背上……=Following {{A}}'s request, \nI applied the magnetic patch to her back...
謝謝你。\n還好有你在，真是幫大忙了。=Thank you, having you here helped me.
然後呢，效果如何？=How's the effect?
想起什麼了嗎？=Remember anything?
……不，沒什麼特別的。\n就是感覺肩膀稍微輕鬆一點了？=...No, nothing in particular. \nJust a little weight off my shoulders?
這種東西，\n感覺不是能立刻起效的吧。=Well, this doesn't seem to have an immediate effect.
可能得持續貼一陣子，\n有一天就會出現效果。=Maybe if I keep applying it for a while, \nit will have some effect.
試試下一樣吧=Let's try the next one
就沒有別的了嗎？=Is there nothing else?
這麼說的話……\n還有些什麼東西來著？=Even if you say so...\nWhat else is there?
……啊。\n我記得有一本據說可以訓練強化記憶的書。=...Ah. I remember there was a training book about strengthening your memory.
{{A}}，按照這本書上寫的……={{A}}, according to this book...
……擁抱。=...Hug.
擁抱的時候，腦內會分泌某種物質，\n記憶力也能得到啟動……好像是這樣的。=Apparently... Hugging secretes chemicals in the brain that also activate memory.
所以，現在和我擁抱吧。=So, give me a hug now.
這也是我一個人絕對做不到的事，\n所以是個好機會。=This is a good opportunity \nbecause I couldn't have done it alone.
怎麼，你是在害羞嗎？\n……現在不用想這麼多啦。=What, are you embarrassed?\n...Don't think so much now.
好啦，快點……\n只要一下下就好。=Come on, hurry up...\nJust a little is fine.
把你的身體借給我。=Lend me your body.
怎麼樣……？=Well...?
你……比我想像的要健壯啊。=Your are more sturdy than I thought.
如果翔還活著的話，\n差不多也會像你這樣吧……=If Kakeru is still alive, \nhe would be like you...
翔是她去世的弟弟的名字吧……=Kakeru should be the name of her deceased brother...
……對不起，\n好像被刺激出了別的記憶。=...Sorry, it seems like a different memory was triggered.
我還是沒能想起那個人的臉。=I still couldn't remember the face of that passerby.
之後也試了幾種方法，\n結果無論哪種都沒起作用……=<size\=28>Tried several methods afterwards, but none of them worked...</size>
怎麼辦……這樣下去要無計可施了。=What to do... If things continue like this, I'll have no other options.
像我這樣不愛和人交往的人會記住的長相，\n我覺得只可能是跟工作相關的。=I'm not good at socializing, so the only faces I can remember are those related to work.
{{A}}……要是像網購記錄一樣，\n有之前見過面的人的長相的歷史記錄就好了。={{A}}... I wish the faces of people I met were kept track of like an online shopping history.
沒有記錄嗎？=No records?
是男的還是女的？=<size\=29>Is it a man or a woman?</size>
記錄？說到工作的記錄……=Records? Speaking of work records...
是男的，這一點不會錯。\n雖然還很年輕，但看起來應該成年了。=It was a man, that's for sure. \nAlthough still young, he looked like an adult.
但如果只知道是年輕的成年男性，\n那真是要多少有多少啊……=But just knowing he's a young adult is not enough...
對了，日誌……！=Yes, the journal...!
消防隊每天的訓練，\n我都會寫下活動日誌。=As part of the fire services' daily routine, \nI always keep an activity journal.
只要重新看一遍日誌，或許就能想起來，\n當時的行人是在哪裡看到過。=If I reread that journal, maybe I'll remember where I saw that passerby.
我居然連這麼簡單的事情都沒有注意到……\n果然只有我一個人是不行的。=I can't even notice something as simple as that... \nI guess I can't do this alone.
sr:"^多虧(.*)，幫大忙了。\n這麼一來，說不定就能知道些什麼。$"="$1, you saved me. Maybe this will help me understand something."
不過就算我發現了對應的人……\n也沒有任何確切的證據。=But even if we found the right person... \nWe would have no solid evidence.
最糟糕的可能是……\n這些全都是我的誤會。=At worst, it's possible that I just misunderstood everything.
如果是這樣你會怎麼做？=If so what would you do?
有沒有什麼好辦法？=Any ideas?
……監視他，如果真的是縱火犯，\n就只能在案發現場抓現行了。=...All I can do is keep an eye on him and, if he's really the arsonist, catch him at the crime scene.
但是，這完全是我自己的想法。=However, this is entirely my own idea.
如果一切都是我的誤會，\n那麼不僅是我，你也會惹上麻煩。=If this was all a misunderstanding, then not only me, but you will be in trouble too.
所以……我希望你，\n當作什麼也沒有聽到。=So... I want you... \nTo act like you never heard anything.
雖然……我會自己去監視他的。\n但你不要再跟這件事扯上任何關係了。=Of course... I'll monitor him myself. \nYou don't have to get involved in this anymore.
我們已經命運與共了=<size\=29>We have a shared destiny</size>
我無法認同=I can't agree
我擔心你會亂來=<size\=24>I'm worried you'll act recklessly</size>
聽你這麼一說……\n我也沒什麼好反駁的了。=Hearing you say that...\nI have no words to refute.
……我知道了，既然都把你牽連進來了，\n我也需要下定決心。=...I get it, and now that I've gotten you involved, \nI need to ready myself.
但……話雖如此，\n我對那個行人還是毫無頭緒。=However... I still have no idea who that passerby was.
甚至有可能，永遠也找不到線索。=There's a chance that the clues will never be found.
但是，如果我找到了線索，\n我也會把資訊共用給你……我向你保證。=But if I find it, I'll share it with you... I promise.
那麼，今天就在這裡解散吧。=Well then, that's all for today.
我會去找那時的行人……\n但……我並不是名偵探。=I will look for that passerby...\nBut I'm no great detective.

我以為是我想盡可能地減少，\n有人因為火災而失去家人的悲傷與苦痛。=I thought it was because I wanted to reduce, even just a little, the grief and pain of losing family members unfairly in a fire.

我尋找火災現場……\n其實是在找一個可以赴死的地方。=My search for fire scenes... It was actually me searching for a place to die.
追蹤縱火犯也是因為，\n那是最可能遭遇到火災現場的途徑……=I was chasing arsonists because that gave me the highest chance of encountering fire scenes...

為什麼要這麼想……！？=Why would you think that...!?
我理解不了=I don't understand
……你有聽說過，倖存者內疚嗎？=...Have you ever heard of survivor's guilt?
所謂倖存者內疚，\n就是在事故或災害中生還的人……=Survivor guilt's is when someone survives an accident or disaster...
會因為周圍的人都離去，\n自己卻獲救了，而感到罪惡感。=And then feels guilty about being the only one who survived while the others died.
……我，正是如此。=...That's exactly what happened to me too.
母親和弟弟去世，只有我自己活下來了……\n這種罪惡感一直籠罩著我。=I've always felt guilty... That my mother and brother died and I was the only one left alive.
雖然父親有安慰過我，\n說著就算只有我活了下來，他也很高興……=Of course, my father told me he was glad I at least survived... But...
……但我父親他，也是名消防員。=...My father, was also a firefighter.
當我們家起火的時候，他正在另一處現場……\n所以他沒能趕回來。=When our house caught fire, he was at another fire scene... And he couldn't make it in time.
那以後，父親為了照顧我，\n辭去了消防員的工作，改行做了其他事情。=Then, my father left the fire service and took another job to raise me on his own.
他曾經對消防員這個工作是那麼的自豪，\n還經常和我，還有我弟弟，談起工作的事……=He took such pride in being a firefighter, that he'd often tell me and my brother stories about his work...
……如果那個時候我也離開了，\n也許父親他就不會辭去消防員的工作了。=...If I'd died back then too, my father wouldn't have had to quit being a firefighter.
不是這樣的！=That's not true!
為什麼會這麼想？=Why think like that?
其實，我知道，道理我都明白，\n但這份罪惡感卻總是揮之不去……=<size\=29>In fact, I know, it's none other than myself who thinks this way. Even if logic understands, \nthe guilt won't fade...</size>
這樣的情感，直到我長大了，\n直到現在，也沒有消失。=Even now, as an adult, \nthose feelings still persist.
也許，我在有意無意間，\n一直在尋找著能夠解脫的辦法。=I've always been searching for a way to free myself from it, maybe unconsciously.
而我找到的答案就是……成為一名消防員，\n然後在火災現場結束我的生命。=And the answer was... To become a firefighter and die at a fire scene.
那個時候，我沒能同母親和弟弟一起離開。=At that time, I was unable to die with my mother and brother.
才導致了父親不得不辭去消防員的工作。=Because of that, my father had to quit being a firefighter.
所以……至少，我要成為一名消防員，\n連著我父親的份一起幫助他人……=At the very least... I'll become a firefighter myself to save people in my father's stead...
……然後，再死去。=...And then, die.
這樣，絕對是錯誤的！=This is absolutely wrong!
這樣，有誰會高興嗎？=Who would be happy?
我知道。但，我控制不了我自己！\n另一個我，一直在我耳邊低語……=I know. But I can't!\nThe other me keeps whispering in my ear...
一直在說，\n「你為什麼還能厚顏無恥地活著呢？」！！=She keeps saying, \n"Why do you still have the audacity to live?"!!
冷靜下來！=Calm down!
……真的很對不起。\n讓你看到我失態的樣子。=...I'm really sorry. You had to see me fall apart.
竟然抱著比我還小的孩子哭……\n剛才真是另一種意義的死了。=Clinging at someone younger and crying like that... Now I want to die in a different way.
都說了不要死=I said no dying
這笑話可不好笑=That's not funny
我死也不會讓你死=I won't let you die
真是的，你這人……\n不，正因為你是這樣的人，我才會……=You really are...\nNo, because of you, I...
……雖然都已經說到這個地步了，\n但我還是想問，為什麼你會對我這麼上心？=...Even after hearing all this, \nwhy do you still care about me?
儘管有很多事情算是機緣巧合……\n可你應該沒有理由做到這個地步。=Even if circumstances piled up this way... \nThere was no reason for you to go this far.

而且，我也……可能，有同樣的想法。=And, I... probably, feel the same way too.

……謝謝。\n多虧了你，我心情總算平復下來了。=...Thank you. \nThanks to you, I'm starting to feel calmer.
雖然剛才說了很多不吉利的話，\n但我不會做出那麼衝動的事情的。=I know I said some scary stuff earlier,\nbut I'm not gonna do anything reckless now.

但這樣一來……\n感覺是為了我，佔用了奶奶的時間……=But this way... it feels like Grandma has to spend her time just for me...
因為不光要陪我去醫院，\n還要陪我做伸展運動……=Besides taking me to the hospital, she helped me stretch too...
我覺得奶奶可能都沒怎麼去眼科檢查。\n她眼睛變差可能也是這個原因……=I think Grandma probably hasn't been getting her regular eye checkups. That might be why her vision has gotten worse...

對……是這樣的。\n對不起，我……=Yes... you're right.\nSorry, I...
一旦開始想這些，就停不下來了呢……\n總是會想起很多不好的事。=Once I start dwelling on this, I can't stop... It's just one negative thought after another.
那時候也是這樣。那些負面評論，\n一直在我腦海裡……=It was the same back then. Those negative comments are always on my mind...
一切的一切都讓我害怕……說我唱得不好，\n讓我別唱了之類。雖然這些已經夠可怕了……=I'm terrified of everything... the criticisms, the "you can't sing", the "just stop". As if those weren't bad enough...
……之前，我們在這裡聊過吧。\n我看到有評論說，好像知道我家在哪。=...We've talked here before, right? I saw a comment that seemed to know my address.
要是家庭地址真的暴露了……\n那些討厭我的人，趁我在學校時找上門……=If my address is really leaked... those who hate me might show up at my home while I'm at school...
我擔心奶奶可能會受到傷害。=I'm afraid Grandma might get hurt.
雖然現在……我已經冷靜多了，\n也能比較理智地思考這些事。=I'm... more composed now. I can finally process this logically.
但那時候，我一直疑神疑鬼……比如，\n會不會學校裡的人也注意到那些評論了？=Back then, I was so paranoid... what if people at school saw those comments too?
一想到這些，\n我都不太敢去學校了……=Just thinking about it made me too scared to even go to school...
結果我就變得不敢出門，\n反而給奶奶添了更多麻煩。=In the end, I became too afraid to leave the house, just ended up causing more trouble for Grandma.
那現在呢？=What about now?
還害怕去學校嗎？=<size\=27>Still scared to go to school?</size>

討厭我的可能不只那1個人……\n說不定學校裡也還有。=Maybe it's not just that one person... \ncould be others at school too.
……不過，現在我好歹能去上學了。\n雖然坐輪椅行動不太方便。=...Still, I can go to school now. Even if getting around in a wheelchair isn't easy.
還有……我跳樓的事好像傳得挺開的。\n班上的同學都躲著我。=And... word about my suicide attempt seems to have spread. All my classmates avoid me.
可以說是……提心吊膽吧？\n只有發列印資料的時候才跟我說上幾句話。=I guess you could say... they're being overly cautious? The only words I get are when they pass me worksheets.
我理解他們的心情。如果我是他們，\n可能也不知道該怎麼和我相處。=I get how they feel. If I were them... I wouldn't know how to act around me either.
啊，但是……！=Ah, but...!
其實沒有我想像中那麼難受啦？=Is it actually not as painful as I imagined?
