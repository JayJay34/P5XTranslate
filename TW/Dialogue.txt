在世界各地，任何時代都存在著盜賊，\n但其中有一些義賊能夠得到民眾的支援。=Theives are in all places and times periods, but accounts of "chivalrous thieves" stealing for the good of the people also exist.
關於這些義賊的傳聞層出不窮，\n比如不傷害貧窮的人，分發盜來的財物……=There are various rumors about these chivalrous thieves, such as they don't target the poor and give away what they steal.
在其中，有一位活躍於13世紀的義大利義賊，\n{{B}}·迪·塔科，他是{{A}}喜歡的類型呢！=My favorite has to be Ghino di Tacco, the Italian chivalrous thief from the 13th century!
他從富人那裡奪取財物，卻會放過窮人，\n還有關於他無償照顧傷病者的說法。=He stole from the rich, but never the poor. There's even an anecdote about him providing care to the sick and injured for free.
他的這些舉動也贏得了民眾的支持，\n因此他被授予了「某個綽號」……=His conduct earned him the support of the people, and he was even given a nickname...
大家知道那個綽號嗎？提示是我……\n也就是說，是個非常適合{{A}}的綽號哦！=Does anyone know what it might be? I'll give you a hint... It perfectly describes yours truly!
r:"^那麼，與我眼神交匯的(.*)君，\n我希望你能猜出他被稱為什麼。$"="Our eyes have met, $1-kun. \nWhat was Ghino di Tacco's nickname?"
小偷=Burglar
紳士=Gentleman
怪人=Weirdo
非常正確！沒錯，就是「紳士」喲。\n多虧了{{B}}的提示，應該很簡單吧？{{A}}！=Correct! Yes, it was "gentleman." \nDid my hint make it too easy? Just kidding!
{{A}}、{{A}}？{{B}}給人的印象是這樣的嗎！？\n正確答案是「紳士」。看吧，和我一模一樣！=J-Just what kind of image do you have of me!? The correct answer is "gentleman." See, just like me!
能夠抓住民眾的心，被稱為紳士……\n看來他一定做了許多值得民眾讚美的事情呢。=To steal the heart's of the people and be called a gentleman thief... He must have been truly something to earn the such praise.
他本來是貴族出身，\n可能有他自己堅持的不可妥協的美德吧……=He was originally born into a noble family, so I suppose he had his own virtues that he wouldn't give up on...
儘管是山賊，他卻在幫助弱者或貧窮的人……\n真是個「紳士」呢！太帥氣了！！=A bandit who helps the weak and the poor... A true gentleman thief! Isn't he just the coolest!?
{{B}}要不要也成為受到學生愛戴的紳士呢！？\n{{A}}，開玩笑的啦！=Shouldn't teachers aim to be gentlemen who are adored by their students like that? Just kidding!
現在想要成為紳士，\n似乎還缺乏一點沉穩呢……=I feel as though they're still a bit lacking in composure to be called a gentleman now...
不過，想要變得更有魅力的慾望是好的。\n你也不能輸給別人哦？=But it's good to have the desire to be charming. Never back down and give it your all too, okay?
不過，想要變得更有魅力的慾望是好的。\n你也不能輸給別人哦！=But it's good to have the desire to be charming. Never back down and give it your all too, okay?

呀吼，今天開始我們要講枕草子啦。=Howdy, everyone! Today we'll be covering \n"The Pillow Book."
對{{A}}我來說，\n清少納言可是知性美人的代名詞！=Sei Shounagon... Talk about beauty and brains! Or at least I think so!
相傳清少納言與紫式部是競爭對手……=They often call her Lady Murasaki's rival...
但比較有說服力的考據說法是\n其實兩人並不相識。=But it's very likely that they'd never met.
兩人進宮做事的時期也差了4年，\n放在今天可就是初三和高三的區別啊？=Their times at the imperial court were off by four years. That's like you all being rivals with a bunch of middle schoolers!
這兩位關係不知是深是淺的文豪的聯動作品……=But, despite their limited relationship,\nthey did collaborate...
就是著名的百人一首！競技歌牌裡讀的那個！=In the "Hyakunin Isshu"! Yes, the poetry collection found now on karuta cards!
尤其是紫式部……\n啊對，不如我先考考同學們。=In it, Lady Murasaki... On second thought,\nI'll ask one of you.
r:"^(.*)同學，都和我對上眼神了，\n這題你來答吧。$"="$1-kun, I saw you first,\nso you answer this one."
在百人一首歌牌競技中，聽到後\n馬上就能分辨出相對應歌牌的叫做決字。=A "kimariji" in karuta is the number of recited syllables you need to identify a card.
那麼，在百人一首中，\n最短的決字是幾字決呢？請作答！咚！=So what's the fewest number of syllables that a kimariji can have in this game? Give me your best shot!
r:"^哇！居然答對了！\n莫非我小瞧了(.*)同學！？$"="Whoa! Ding ding ding! Unbelievable! \nI might've underestimated you, $1-kun!"
嗯……是不是有點難了？\n正確答案，是只有1個字！=Ah... Maybe that was a bit of a toughie. \nThe correct answer is one!
百人一首中共有7個1字決。\n紫式部所寫的歌就是其中之一。=There are seven cards with a kimariji of one.\nLady Murasaki's poem is among them.
只要記住那七個1字決歌詞的\n第一個發音「mu su me fu sa ho se」就好。=They're remembered by their first syllables...
但在不了解的人看來，\n說不定以為這是什麼暗號呢。=Just rememmber "mu, su, me, fu, sa, ho, and se." That's the trick!
雖然不是什麼非記不可的重點，\n但知道了今後說不定能提高歌牌勝率呢？=It's not like this will come up on your exams, but it could help you win your next game of karuta!
{{B}}是不是過於博學啦？\n{{A}}，可不能因此……迷上！我！唷！=I must seem pretty scholarly now, huh? {{A}}! Don't let this make me your favorite teacher, though, okay?
{{B}}……先把迷不迷上他這件事放一邊，\n但在{{A}}作戰時，這道理也是共通的。=Hoom... Putting aside any favoritism, such tricks could also be useful for our {{A}} battles.
硬實力固然重要，\n但關鍵是掌握到思考如何發揮實力的知識。=Brute force is important, but not as much as the Knowledge required to figure out how to steal something.

呀吼，今天開始，我們要來一起學習，\n日本文學史上的知名傑作：源氏物語。=Howdy! Today we'll be starting "The Tale of Genji," a true Japanese literature classic.
{{C}}我啊，會努力向大家傳達故事魅力的哦！\n{{B}}，我是不是有點用力過度啦，{{A}}。=I'll do my darnedest to make sure you all get why it's so amazing! And I'll try to not go overboard with my enthusiasm, hahaha.
話是這麼說……教科書選的桐壺的故事，\n實在提不起興趣啊。=But I will say the way Kiritsubo is described in the textbook doesn't get me very hype, if I'm honest...
提到源氏物語，那當然還是主角——=Speaking of which-
「光源氏」人見人愛的故事更知名、\n更有意思嘛～=Hikaru Genji's romantic escapades are so well known and interesting!
好，那就來個關於受歡迎的訣竅的問題\n考考大家呀！？=Maybe I should start with a quiz on the secret to his charm?
r:"^就選你了，(.*)同學。$"="So then... $1-kun!"
享譽天下的花花公子光源氏，\n最受當時女子們歡迎的是哪一點呢！=What did women of the time find so attractive about Hikaru Genji, the ultimate playboy?
財力=Wealth
品味=Taste
光彩照人的魅力=Charm
既然名叫光源氏，\n那肯定是氣質上的閃光點惹人喜愛對吧！？=Ah, did you say that because "hikaru" means "to shine"?
可惜並不是的，人們看上的是他的財力。=Sorry, the real answer was his wealth.
哦，不簡單呀。沒錯，答對啦！就是財力。=Ah, I see you're a careful reader.\nThat's right! It was his wealth.
以他的富有程度，甚至能造間豪宅，\n容下所有與他纏綿過的女子。=After all, he had enough money to have a mansion built so he could live there with all his romantic conquests.
現在聽起來，\n讓女子們共處一室非鬧出人命不可！=While the idea of a shared house between lovers may seem pretty wild...
但對那個時代的女子們來說，\n這也不失為一樁美事。=...it wasn't so bad for the time.
當時的女性幾乎沒有工作機會，\n日常生活必須要靠男子接濟……=There were barely any jobs for women then, so they would have needed a man to help them find a place to live...
在這個背景下，\n光源氏對哪怕只接觸過一次的情人……=Hikaru Genji wasn't someone who just threw his past lovers to the curb...
也都不離不棄，甚至給她造新房接濟生活。=He gave them not just a home, but a certain lifestyle.
在那時的女子們看來，\n這不就是個顧家好男人嘛？=He probably looked like a reliable guy to women at the time!
……不過這只是我的個人想法。=...That's my theory, at least.
光源氏光彩照人的部分，並非只有容貌，\n錢包也五顏六色……開玩笑啦！=Guess it wasn't just his good looks that shined, but the coins in his purse too... Just kidding!
嗯嗯，以當下的倫理觀來看，\n雖然令人難以接受。=Hoom... That is problematic by today's moral standards.
但對有糾葛的對象也不離不棄\n確實值得稱道。=But his sense of loyalty toward his companions is commendable.
博愛不也是我們的目標嗎？=Perhaps we ought to learn from his example.

好，來看第5行。肯穿著同款的運動制服……\n不行不行，實在太讓人在意了。=Line 5! Ken saw the matching uniforms, and... \nNo, wait a minute.
我好像一看到這樣的句子就會有一種……=I can't ignore this...
「頭會頭疼」呀、「危險很危險」啊\n之類的感覺。=Or "that's a dangerous threat." \nIt's like saying "my headache hurts!"
啊～雖然我知道這有點雞蛋裡挑骨頭，\n但在意不就是這樣的嘛。=It's technically redundant and incorrect. \nI just can't get over that.
r:"^好，(.*)。\n我的這份焦躁就由你來陪伴一下吧。$"="Okay, $1-kun. \nHelp me out with this mess."
我在意的是運動制服，uniform這個單詞\nform的意思是形狀，那uni是什麼意思？=What troubles me is the word "uniform." \n"Form" means shape, but what is uni-?
單一的=One
官方的=Official
獨特的=Unique
OK，答對了。\n單一的……也就是表達這之類意思的單詞呢。=Ok, you're correct. \nIt means "one" as in "single."
我大概能猜出你為什麼會這麼想，\n不過很遺憾，你答錯了，答案是單一的。=I can see why you guessed that, \nbut unfortunately, it means "one."
意思是一個形狀，也就是隊服都是一樣的。\n畢竟是隊服，肯定都是一樣的吧？="Uniform" literally means something that has one form. So of course they match! No need to say so.
……這麼吐槽的話，就是在吹毛求疵了吧。=...No one likes the grammar police, though.
應該因為我是當{{A}}的，\n所以總是會在意這些……=But I can't help it. I'm a teacher!
雖然在意細節並不是件壞事，\n但是說出口來就變成嘲諷啦～=Paying attention to details like that isn't bad. But it sounds a bit snobby when you point it out.
你們也要注意不要變成討厭的中年人哦？\n畢竟意外有很多自己都察覺不到的人呢。=So try not to be a smart aleck, okay?
你們也要注意不要變成討厭的中年人哦！\n畢竟意外有很多自己都察覺不到的人呢。=So try not to be a smart aleck, okay?
已經意識到自己「馬上就要變成這種人」的我\n說的話是不是很有說服力啊？=Because you probably make just as many mistakes without realizing.
那，繼續上課吧～=Now, back to class～
即使意識到了也改不了，\n就變成他那樣了……？=Awareness alone doesn't fix mistakes...
是因為自己想成為什麼樣的慾望\n是獏一般的存在嗎。=Perhaps one's many desires of who they want to become are to blame.
r:"^(.*)，為了不變成那樣，\n你要好好保持自己的慾望啊。$"="Hold your desires close, $1, \nor you'll end up like that."

在上次的長篇閱讀裡，\n很多同學搞不清楚數詞。=Many students get hung up on numbers when reading in English.
所以我再來說明一下，\n應該說是來講講數詞的訣竅吧。=Let me give you a little trick to reading them correctly.
在日語裡，不管增加多少個零，\n我們都知道單位會在哪裡發生變化。=We count numbers one way in Japanese. For us it makes perfect sense, and it's what our brains are used to.
但換到英語，\n很多時候完全弄不明白。=So it can be difficult to read big numbers when saying them out loud in a foreign language.
r:"^(.*)同學，\n你來回答一下。$"="Let's see you give it a shot, $1-kun."
Hundred million，用日語來說的話，\n是多少呢？=One "oku" in Japanese is a large amount. \nBut how much exactly is it?
1000萬=Ten million
１億=One hundred million
10億=One billion
突然被問到會搞錯也是難免呢。\n正確答案是1億。=I did say it was hard, to be fair. \nBut one oku is one hundred million.
嗯，學習很用功呢。\n回答正確，就是1億。=Well, aren't you good with numbers? \nYou're right. It's one hundred million.
讓大家產生混亂的原因在於，日語和英語中，\n讓計數單位發生變化的位數是不一樣的。=Large numbers are especially confusing because they're split up differently in Japanese and English.
在日語中，數量達到一萬時，會變為下一個\n單位，而英語中，是以千為計數單位。=In English, you can have up to one hundred "thousands." But in Japanese, "ten thousand" is its own unit.
也就是說，每3位數，計數單位發生一次變\n化……和在數字中添加逗號時的法則相同。=English numbers change every three zeros.\nThese are marked with commas.
1億的話，數字表示是100,000,000。=100,000,000 is one hundred million...
因為最前面是100，\n所以英文中用hundred來表示。=...because 100 comes before the first comma.
在數字中添加逗號是英語圈的通用表示方式，\n用英語來思考的話，會比較容易理解。=Makes sense, since writing numerals like this was invented in the English-speaking world.
這種知識對於應試來說沒什麼用處。=Might not help much on your exam.
但將來等你們要處理大額數字時，\n可以稍微回憶一下。=But keep it in mind for the future anyway.
數個數的方法竟然都如此不一樣……\n人類真的是很講究啊。=So many unique ways of counting... Human inventions like these are truly impressive.
到底是什麼慾望才會導致這種結果，\n試想一下似乎也很有趣。=It could be interesting to think about what desires caused these divergences.

……我先不在這裡具體點名了，\n最近有同學主動來提問。=I won't name names...
我還挺高興的，\n算是體會到了為人師的價值……？=...but I had one student who really made me happy to be a teacher.
但在問完之後，這位同學滿臉高興地\n說了一句，「{{A}}，您可真會多管閒事啊！」=They had the most sincere look on their face, but then told me, "You're such a busybody!"
……大概，他是想說是我很會照顧人吧。\n語言可真難啊。=I think they meant I work hard to help them. Finding the right words in a second language can be hard...
……哎，這種情況不僅限於日語，\n其實在英語裡也會時常發生。=Differences in nuance like this exist in every language, including both English and Japanese.
比如……fate和destiny之類。=Take "fate" and "destiny," for example.
雖然兩個詞語都是命運的意思，\n但給人的印象是不一樣的。=They are similar, but slightly different.
r:"^(.*)同學，你來回答下。\n憑直覺就行，直覺。$"="Right, $1-kun? \nLet's test your sense for nuance."
和destiny一詞相比，fate在語義上\n是更為積極呢，還是更為消極呢。是哪種？=Compared to "destiny," is "fate" more positive or negative of a word?
積極=Positive
消極=Negative
其實是一樣的=They're the same
有點跑偏了啊。\nfate在意思上更偏向消極。=I'm afraid you're wrong. \n"Fate" is actually more negative.
直覺挺准啊！\n如果不是靠直覺回答的話，GREAT。=Nice intuition. You have a knack for this I see!
沒錯，這個詞會用於消極語境。=As you said, it's often used in a bad sense.
這個詞原意為拉丁語中「神所說的話」。\n不可避免的命運，引申為與死亡相連。=It comes from the Latin for "thing spoken by the gods." It's used to mean an inescapable result, much like death.
因為神明都這麼說了，人類無論如何掙扎\n也沒用。所以會有消極的含義。=A god's word cannot be changed, no matter what. That's what makes it negative.
Destiny原意為「穩穩站立」……\n引申為「決定」。="Destiny" stems from a word meaning "make firm." Thus, it carries an air of decisiveness.
這個詞多用於依靠自我意志，\n有可能開創更美好未來的語境裡。=But through willpower, you can intervene and change things, so "destiny" is used to refer to the unknown.
哎，無論是什麼語言，詞彙都很重要哦。=Word choice is critical in every language.
那麼今天也努力好好上一節，\n能增加你們詞彙量的課吧。=That's why today we'll be focusing on boosting your vocabulary.
儘管意思相近，\n但給人的印象卻不盡相同。=There are plenty of words with similar meanings but different nuances.
的確，吾也能想到幾個這種例子……=I can think of quite a few of them, \nbut how about you all...?
不，等等。\n意思相似，但印象卻截然不同的東西……=But wait, what about words that also have the same nuance...?
那麼，「善哉紅豆年糕湯」和\n「紅豆年糕湯」……到底有什麼不同呢……？=How are "flammable" and "inflammable" different...?

好，這個ing是形容詞解釋名詞的作用，\n大家注意一下現在分詞修飾哦。=The -ing makes it function like an adjective here. This is called the present participle.
說起ing……我最近很在意，\n所以查了一下Wedding這個詞。=Speaking of -ing... I got curious and looked into the word "wedding" recently.
婚紗什麼的英語作為名詞經常聽說，\n但是作為動詞用的還是非常少見的。=You'll hear it in nouns like "wedding dress" all the time, but it's almost never used as a verb, like "I'm wedding my wife today."
要是求婚的話，\n大家一般都會聯想到用動詞marry的吧？=Instead, we use the verb "marry." \nLike in the cliché phrase used during a proposal.
然後我就查了一下，發現wed因為詞源問題，\n使用場合還是蠻受限的。=So, I looked up the etymology of "wed" and found it's because it was originally only used in limited situations.
r:"^好，那我來提問。(.*)，\n你來回答一下。憑直覺就行哦。$"="Let's see if you can figure out which ones.\nListen up, $1-kun, and make a guess."
你覺得wed這個詞的詞源來自什麼？\n稍微拋開結婚的事情考慮也許比較好哦。=What was the original meaning of "wed"? \nKeep in mind, it's not related to marriage.
愛情=Love
承諾=Promise
……我說你啊，這回答哪裡拋開結婚話題了？\n連我都有點開始擔心你了。=How isn't that related to marriage? As your teacher, I'm concerned about your listening skills.
啊……總之課後再單獨找你談談，\n答案竟然是賭博。沒錯，Gamble。=We can discuss that later, but for now... \nthe correct answer is "gamble."
哦，好敏銳。對於結婚你居然有這種想法……\n莫非你是個賭博高手？=Ah, very sharp. You must be an experienced gambler to make that connection.
先不開玩笑啦。\n恭喜你，答對了！=But enough jokes. Congrats! You're right!
有一種說法是wed的詞源是賭博的賭注。\n據說是從過去就存在的彩禮習俗而來的。="Wed" is derived from a word meaning "wager," and supposedly referred to the money to be spent on a bride.
雖然不知道是不是真的，但是蠻有說服力的。\n畢竟也有人說什麼結婚就是賭注啊，之類的。=I don't know if it's true, but I'd buy it. Some people do call marriage a gamble, after all.
……啊，那麼說的話也太沒有夢想了。\n大家就見仁見智吧。=Or maybe that's a little too cynical... \nLet's just say it depends on the person.
要吾說，能算是賭博的不止是婚姻，\n人生也是如此吧。=In my opinion, marriage isn't the only gamble. \nLife, for example, is all about taking risks.
畢竟在誰也不知道未來會發生什麼的情況下，\n要殉身於自己所堅信的慾望呢。=People sacrifice themselves for the desires they believe in, not knowing what awaits them.

這時，貝蒂對此十分期待……\n譯文就到這裡。你們要好好跟上進度啊。=In this case, this means "Betty was looking forward to it." The rest of the translation is up to you.
不過，慣用語如果只靠死記硬背的話，\n要用的話總是想不起來，真的很頭疼呢。=But don't think you can just sit and memorize every idiom. There are way too many to do that.
但說到底，英語也只是一種語言，\n每個詞句其實都有意義和背景。=Luckily, English phrases are composed of words, and words always have an etymology and meaning.
按這樣理解，即使遇到不認識的單詞，\n它也可以成為理解詞義的線索。=Learning how to decode those can give valuable insight when you come across a new word.
你們得記住哦。=Please remember that.
r:"^對了，(.*)同學。\n你來回答下。$"="Hm... Okay, $1-kun.\nSee if you can get this one."
abduct、only、never。在這三個單詞中，\n你覺得和「１」有關係的單詞是哪個？="Abduct." "Only." "Never." \nWhich word is derived from a number?
abduct=Abduct
only=Only
never=Never
可惜，答錯了。那又是另一種含義了。=Sorry, that's not it.
回答正確，沒錯。=Yes, that's correct.
one詞尾加上形容詞尾碼ly，\n這就變成了「僅此而已」的意思。=It comes from "one" plus -ly. \nAnd of course it means "one of a kind."
順便說一下，ab這個首碼有「離開」的意思。=The prefix ab- means "away."
引導至更遠的地方，\n所以這個詞的意思是「誘拐」。=Which helps identify its meaning of carrying away someone or something.
never的ne有否定的意思。\n「截至現在還沒有」，所以是「絕對沒有」。=The "ne-" part was an old form of "not." \nHence its meaning of not ever.
所有的單詞都是都有其意義的。\n這和漢字的偏旁、部首是一個道理。=Each part of an English word has meaning. The same as ideograms or the kanji we use in Japanese.
哎，雖然這種知識和大家的升學名次沒有直接關係……=It's not always that simple, of course...
但知道了也許哪天會派上用場，\n你們都記一記。=But the more you know, right?
英語單詞也和漢字一樣……？=English and Japanese look so different...
因為形狀完全不一樣，\n我可從來沒想到過這一層。=I never thought they'd function in similar ways.
嗯…即便是看起來毫無意義的習慣，\n也有其理由和背景。有趣。=Hoom. In other words, while a foreign custom may seem nonsensical to us, it still has its own purpose and history. How intriguing.

{{A}}……前陣子看了朋友推薦的\n熱血男子漢{{B}}傳記電影，真是神作啊。=Guess what? A friend recommended me a biopic on a man named Rob Roy. His display of altruism was truly amazing.
他為了挨餓的百姓們而買牛營生，\n卻遭到貴族惡人的誆騙……=He buys cattle to help starving people, \nonly for an evil aristocrat to swindle him...
朋友慘遭殺害，妻子也被搶走……=Kill his friend and kidnap his wife...
而先抑後揚的大逆轉劇情也隨之開幕！=But then the outlaw turns it all around!
一槍崩掉那假髮混蛋的瞬間可真是！=Oh, seeing him stand defiantly against that wigged jerk really had my heart racing!
……罷了，你們也不愛看老電影。\n怪我不該自己這麼起勁，抱歉啦。{{A}}。=...I see you kids find older movies boring. \nSorry if I got a bit too carried away. {{A}}.
既然難得提到{{A}}了……就跟大家\n分享一個與牛有關的數學小知識。=Oh, I know. Seeing as we're talking about Rob Roy... how about a math question involving cattle?
它叫阿基米德群牛問題。=It's known as Archimedes's cattle problem.
題中給出了不同牛的各種特徵，\n要求解答不同牛分別有多少隻。=It's all about how many cows you need.
r:"^(.*)，你來回答看看。\n別緊張，就當做做頭腦體操了。$"="Try answering this, $1-kun. \nJust think of it as a fun little brainteaser."
西元前２５０年左右提出的群牛問題，\n經過了多少年才得到了解答？=Archimedes's cattle problem was posed around 250 BC. How many years did it take to get solved?
２０年=20 years
２００年=200 years
２０００年=2,000 years
少了少了，正確答案是２０００年以上。=Nope, even more. It took over 2,000 years.
正確解答是１９６５年才出現的。=It was finally solved in 1965.
沒錯，就是２０００年以上。=Ah, that's right! It took over 2,000 years.
不過，這題是不是阿基米德出的都不一定。=But I guess it is a bit unclear when exactly it was posed by Archimedes, so it's not like it was this ever-unsolvable problem.
而且，也不是\n２０００多年來一直不斷有人嘗試解題啦。=Still, a problem that escaped being answered for that long... 
橫跨兩千年的未解難題……\n聽起來是不是挺浪漫的？=Doesn't it remind you of chasing some impossible dream?
世上就是有一種人，為了得到想要的答案\n而不斷戰鬥。為此投入多少時光都在所不惜。=Time just kept passing and passing, and yet, there were always people toiling to find the solution.
{{A}}的活法也與其有相似之處啊，\n太熱血了。=Kind of like how Rob Roy lived.
……等下班回家，我想想要不要再看一遍。=...Maybe I'll rewatch that movie when I get home.
為得到自己追尋的答案而持續奮戰嗎……=That feeling of striving to obtain the solution you desire...
哼哼，這班主任還挺懂的嘛。=Hoohoo... Katayama-sensei gets it.

啊，好累……有個學生得了區級研究獎。=So, one of the students in another class won a local research prize.
雖然不是多大的獎，但要做各種準備，\n來回折磨我啊……=I've been roped into helping them prepare a few things...
明明平日的工作量一點也沒少，\n竟然還安排我幫忙準備，{{A}}……=...But I was so pleased to see their hard work being rewarded, I cried as if it was my own award!
算了，得獎本身倒是個值得高興的事情。\n你們乾脆都去努力拿個諾貝爾獎吧。=So I hope you all invest yourselves in math just as much as they did. Enough to win a Nobel Prize!
啊……但是諾貝爾獎……\n我的這個課有點問題呢。=Heheh, only kidding... Oh, but this might make for a good question for the class.
r:"^雖然這屬於雜學，但還是想稍微提問一下。\n(.*)你來回答。$"="This isn't so much math-related as it is trivia, but I'll ask anyway. Try answering this, $1-kun."
在表彰各個領域的功績的諾貝爾獎中，\n你知道哪個領域不在其表彰範圍內嗎？=The Nobel Prize is awarded in a number of fields, but guess which field doesn't get one.
化學=Chemistry
數學=Mathematics
文學=Literature
很遺憾，獎項裡包括哦。\n答案是……竟然是數學。=Sorry, but there IS a prize for that field. \nThe answer is... math. Can you believe it?
對，沒錯！不知為何就是沒有啊！\n諾貝爾數學獎！=Yep, that's right!
對此有很多說法，被數學家搶走了戀人，\n所以諾貝爾憎恨數學……=There's no Nobel Prize in math for whatever reason!
這種說法比較常見。=One popular theory is that a mathematician stole Nobel's lover...
也許大家會覺得「怎麼可能這樣？」\n我反而覺得稍微能理解他的心情。=It sounds ridiculous, I agree. \nBut at the same time... I kinda get it.
因為，如果恨和尚就恨袈裟之類的，\n這不是普遍存在的現象嗎？=While it's important that we devote ourselves to our studies, it's only human to let our\nemotions get the better of us at times.
對了，即使沒有諾貝爾數學獎，\n也有世界級的菲爾茲獎，所以大家放心吧。=But don't worry. In terms of world famous awards for math, there's still the Fields Medal!
{{A}}，雖然也不知道這算哪門子放心。\n閒聊到此結束。大家翻開代數那一頁吧？=Then again, none of you look too worried... Anyway, enough chit-chat. Flip open to the chapter on algebra, please.
正因為是過於私人的理由，才顯得真實嗎。=The overly personal reason does make it seem far truer than a nicely manicured life story.
確實，這種理由比讀一遍一本正經的傳記，\n更讓人感興趣。=It seems all the more believable because he was true to his desires.
正因為忠實於慾望，才被相信的事情……\n這可謂是人類強大的根本啊。=I'd even wager that doing so is the basis of humanity's strength.

{{A}}……真受不了。幹我這行的，\n每年都會被說幾次同樣的話。={{A}}... I can't stand it. I hear it time and time again all year round as a teacher.
「學數學有什麼用」。="I'm not gonna use this math outside of school."
……我承認，平時的數學知識，只要\n夠算明白折後價，就能應付日常生活了。=And sure, you may only need arithmetic in daily life to figure out discounts and stuff...
但其實，許多人們在日常生活中享受的便利，\n都是由數學帶來的好不好？=But we have math to thank for even the most mundane little parts of our lives, you know!
時鐘、日曆、地圖，\n可都是數學計算的產物呀。=Clocks, calendars, maps... \nAll of it is thanks to math.
連歷史都是與數學有關的。=Math even has ties in historical events.
r:"^來，(.*)。你總能給我舉出個\n數學家影響歷史的事例吧！？$"="Hey, $1. Tell me, what was a time when math affected history?"
人類誕生=The birth of humanity
終結戰爭=The ending of a war
創造日語=<size\=22>The Japanese language's creation</size>
回答正確。沒錯，就是終結戰爭。\n不過也確實不是他一個人的功勞罷了。=That's right! The ending of a war. Don't get me wrong, though, someone didn't stop a war just with math.
不是……這只靠個人根本沒法實現吧。\n正確答案是終結戰爭啦。=I mean... How could one individual ever do that? But yes, the answer is ending of a war.
在戰爭中解讀敵軍暗號……\n數學家可是為此做出了巨大貢獻的。=I'm talking about decrypting German codes during the Second World War. Mathematicians played a huge role in that, you know.
暗號是由馬里安·雷耶夫斯基奠定破譯基礎，\n艾倫·圖靈實際解讀成功的。=Marian Rejewski laid the groundwork for it, \nand Alan Turing completed it, basically.
據說，沒有他們解讀暗號，\n戰爭還要多打３年，造成更多的傷亡。=It's said they shortened the war by three years and saved countless lives with their work.
圖靈同時也是現代電腦科學之父……\n等於是為如今的智慧手機技術也奠定了基礎。=Turing is also the father of modern computer science. You can thank him for your smartphones!
看，數學用處多大呀！就算真無用武之地，\n數字本身也是很美的。=See? Math does help you in life. Though it doesn't need to be useful to be beautiful.
受不了……看到那些大談數學無用論的傢伙，\n有時我是真忍不住想一拳揍下去……=Honestly, I really wish people would think twice before they say that math is useless or pointless.
再怎麼認真解釋數學的用處，\n也堵不住想討論數學有用沒有者的嘴……=If she doesn't want people talking about how it is or isn't useful, why does she bring it up?
看來人類確實是缺乏邏輯和統一性的生物。\n慾望的性質也是如此。=Humans can be such irrational and incoherent creatures. Though I suppose desire behaves in much the same way.

r:"^(.*)，醒著呢嗎？\n稍微來個大腦體操，回答一下吧。$"="$1-kun, are you with us? \nTime for a little mental workout."

好好好，謝謝同學們提交實驗報告～=Thanks for turning in your reports～
實驗失敗的小組也不要灰心。=And those of you who failed the experiment, keep your chins up!
失敗經歷會為你們累積更多經驗，\n證明你們可以更加進步！=I saw more examples that made me question how they failed. That's a sure sign of progress!
基於觀察結果進行推測，\n建立假設，展開實驗，考察實驗結果。=Make assumptions and hypotheses based on observations, verify them through experimentation...
這就是所謂的實證主義～=...and evaluate the results. \nThat's the scientific method～
千百年來，\n人類都是透過這個流程取得新發現的。=It's also how humanity arrives at new discoveries.
比如１８世紀的醫學家塞麥爾維斯！=Take Ignaz Semmelweis for example, an incredible 18th century doctor!
當年他可是透過兩個患者樓中差距驚人的\n死亡率，來找出解決辦法的傳奇人物。=He discovered the cause of a large discrepancy in mortality rates between two hospital wards.
r:"^雖然放在當代，這算是理所當然……\n好，(.*)同學，我來問問你！$"="And now that knowledge has pretty much become common sense. All right, $1-san. I choose you!"
由塞麥爾維斯發明，在當代醫學中廣泛應用\n的、控制死亡率的解決辦法是什麼？=What was Semmelweis's countermeasure that reduced patient mortality rates and is now common practice?
藥品重複利用=<size\=23>Using medicine in different ways</size>
洗手和消毒=<size\=24>Washing hands and disinfecting</size>
與病人搞好關係=Good bedside manner
嗯——不是的。正確答案是洗手和消毒。=Hmm, unfortunately not. The answer was washing hands and general disinfecting.
這題有點難度，你不必太消沉～\n{{A}}我第一次知道時也很吃驚啦。=Bit of a curveball, huh? Don't sweat it. It threw me for a loop the first time I heard it too.
這你都知道！沒錯，就是洗手和消毒。=Well, I've got to hand it to you there! \nThat's right, hand-washing and disinfectant.
當年人們還相信致病的原因是\n氣溫或者體液的失衡。=Back then, by trying to maintain a balanced temperature and bodily fluids to prevent illness, he discovered disinfecting!
根本沒有細菌這個概念。=There was no such concept as bacteria.
在那個時代，這一發現是真～的太先進了！\n……先進到那時的人們無法接受的程度。=Now is that a cutting-edge discovery or what! Too much so, actually—no one believed him.
塞麥爾維斯雖然發現了這個對策，\n但沒能證明為什麼消毒會有這種效果。=Ignaz Semmelweis came up with the method, \nbut couldn't prove disinfectant was effective.
所以他的發現雖很偉大，\n卻不受人認可備遭排擠。=Without his great discovery recognized...
這也讓他精神消沉自暴自棄，\n最後撒手人寰……=...he succumed to a mental breakdown, \neventually dying of a bacterial infection...
{{A}}我很能理解他的感受。\n世上確實是有難以證明的正確之事……=I identify with the guy, really, I do. Some things are right, even if you can't prove it...
也就是說，自我的慾望遭到了他人的否定吧。\n真是個引人深思的故事。=Having that which you desire rejected, hoom? A scenario that gives much food for thought, to be sure.
但如今，他的發現已成為了世上的常識。\n他若泉下有知，會作何感想呢？=How would that man feel to see a world where his discovery has become common knowledge?

所以給礦物分類時的指標，\n是用有色或者無色來區分的哦～=...This means that when minerals are classified, they are done so based on whether or not they have color～
說起礦物的分類……立刻能想到的是硬度吧？\n叫做「莫氏硬度」的尺度很有名吧。=What's another property we might use to classify minerals? Hardness. The Mohs scale is the most well-known measure for this.
把能代表礦物不易受損程度的１０個等級，\n用於調查挖掘出的礦物……=They're rated on a scale from one to ten for their scratch resistance. It's a useful scale to reference when excavating ore...
r:"^(.*)，作為身邊的科學我來問問看吧？\n(.*)同學，你來回答一下～$"="$1, I know! Let's bring this topic a bit closer to home. $2-san, you take this one."
人體有比莫氏硬度７的鐵還要硬的部分，\n那是哪裡呢～?=Which part of the human body is harder than iron and registers seven on the Mohs scale?
恆齒=Adult teeth
肋骨=The ribs
頭骨=The skull
叮咚叮咚，非常正確！\n對，就是恆齒的琺瑯質～=Ding ding ding, correctamundo! \nIt's the enamel on your teeth～
嗯……很遺憾！\n答案是恒牙的琺瑯質。=Aaand... Bzzt, wrong! The answer is the enamel on adult teeth.
骨頭只有４～５的硬度，\n也就是說跟鐵或者玻璃差不多硬呢～=Our bones come in at around four or five on the scale, making them about as tough as iron or glass.
不過，莫氏硬度是衡量不易受傷程度的標準，\n這和不容易壞又是兩碼事呢。=Though the Mohs scale only denotes resistance to being scratched, not breaking.
而且，牙齒是一個很受負荷的地方。\n聽說磨牙的負荷和體重一樣呢！=Besides, our teeth take a ton of stress. We grind them with the same force as our body weight!
{{A}}我有個朋友，還因為咬了口巧克力派，\n就缺了一塊牙呢。=One of my friends chipped a tooth on chocolate cake once.
肯定是牙齒累壞了吧。=His teeth were in bad shape.
雖說牙齒很硬，但也不要過於自信，\n要珍惜牙齒～=Teeth are tough, but you have to take good care of them～
……{{A}}？剛才在講什麼來著？\n好了繼續上課～=...I've gone on a bit of a tangent. \nLet's get back to the lesson.
不容易受傷和不容易壞是兩碼事……嗎。\n簡直就像在說人心一般啊。=Hard to scratch doesn't mean hard to break... Sounds like the human spirit, if you ask me.
誰都會因為意想不到的事情而灰心喪氣。\n作為探究慾望的人，要銘記在心呢。=Anyone can suffer unexpected heartbreak. Those who study desire should bear this in mind.

好好聽講～\n所以說呢地球是一天轉一圈的～=Right, so the earth makes a full revolution around the sun once a year, yes?
這雖然對現在的人來說是理所當然的事……=Everybody knows this now, but presenting the theory was no walk in the park at first.
但當初發表地球在移動這種學說的時候，\n可是很不容易的哦。=Before that, everyone thought things revolved\naround Earth... 
畢竟在那之前，天動說是理所當然的呢。\n新學說應該說是天翻地覆的感覺呢。=...so I guess you could say they had their world turned upside down!
r:"^雖然是世界史的話題，但作為科學也很重要……\n(.*)同學，你來回答一下吧。$"="This topic is fit for both world history and science. Now, riddle me this, $1-san."
地動說對於某個領域來說，被認為是個……\n嗯，致命的問題……你覺得是在哪個領域？=Heliocentric theory is a massive problem for a certain field of study. Care to guess which?
文學=Literature
宗教=Religion
家政學=Home economics
嗯……這個領域，{{A}}我不太專業呢……\n雖然不敢斷言，但不至於致命吧？=Hmm, that's outside of my field of expertise, but I don't think it'd cause a big problem there.
答案啊，是宗教。=I was looking for "religion."
在當時的西方文化中，宗教是很大的權威，\n所以地動說成了大問題。=Religion held great authority in old Western culture.
沒錯，就是宗教。在當時的西方文化中，\n宗教是非常大的權威，所以成了大問題呢！=Exactly, religion. This put a big damper on religion's sway over Western culture!
當時，\n人們認為宇宙的中心理所當然的是人類。=Back then, it was just accepted as fact that we were at the center of the universe.
所以由於地動說否定了這個常識，\n成了很多人難以接受的說法。=The idea of everything revolving around the sun was a hard pill for many to swallow.
不過啊，一直相信的事情，\n與真相是看似相同實則不同的兩碼事呢……=Still, what you believe and what is true isn't always the same thing...
希望大家不要被傳統的常識所束縛，\n能夠成為誠實探究眼前現象的人呢。=I hope all of you will come to assess things with your own eyes, not just fall back on bias.
雖然配合好周圍的人也很重要，\n{{A}}我覺得追尋真相也很棒呢！=It's important to fit in with your peers, \nbut I think the pursuit of truth is way cooler!
自己相信的事和真相，看似相同，實則不同。\n……這句話相當耐人尋味啊。=What you believe isn't the same as what is true... Poignant words worth remembering.
這對於不迎合周圍的人，\n追求眼前的真實的吾等來說，切不可忘記啊。=One must always pursue the truth that lies ahead, not ingratiate oneself to one's peers.

大家聽好～就像這樣以「適者生存」的方式，\n生物的性狀發生了變化～=So, we believe the survival of the fittest idea explains how life changes form and nature.
其實至今還都在討論各種各樣的說法，\n比如運者生存……=Various theories continue to be tested...
也就是說，幸運的個體存活了下來。\n也有這種說法呢。=Heck, some even posit it's more of a "survival of the luckiest."
但實際上，不需要的器官的確有退化的傾向，\n{{A}}我也覺得環境是很大的影響因素呢。=I'd argue, however, that organs which are actually unnecessary tend to degenerate, and the environment plays a major factor.
生活在深海的魚不需要感知光線，\n所以逐漸失明了……=You've heard about deep-sea fish, right?
之類的都是很有名的說法吧？=They don't need to sense light, \nso they've become blind.
就像這樣，我們的身體也因為「用不著」，\n有些部位可能會消失哦？=Even humans have a body part that could disappear because we don't need it anymore.
就像這樣，我們的身體也因為「用不著」，\n有些部位可能會消失哦！=Even humans have a body part that could disappear because we don't need it anymore.
r:"^(.*)，是不是很有趣？\n好，那我來考考(.*)同學吧。$"="$1, I bet that got your gears turning. \nAll right, I'll ask you, $2-san."
有可能從人體退化消失的部位，\n你覺得是哪裡呢？=Which part of the human body could possibly degenerate and, eventually, disappear?
牙齒=Teeth
眼睫毛=Eyelashes
小腳趾=Pinky toes
很遺憾～這個部位還是有用的呢。\n正確答案是，小腳趾！=Sorry, but you kind of still need those. \nThe answer is our pinky toes!
答對了～！沒錯，就是小腳趾。=Cooorrect～! The answer is our pinky toes.
實際上，\n大家是不是也覺得平時用不太到它呢？=Don't you feel like you don't use yours much?
人類走路時最重要的是大腳趾的踢出，\n據說小腳趾幾乎是不會受力的。=Humans kick off of their big toe to walk,\nputting almost no weight on their pinky toe.
腳趾的退化並不是什麼稀罕事哦。\n比如，馬兒們的蹄子不是只有一個腳趾嗎？=Losing toes is not all that rare in the animal kingdom. After all, horses have single hoofs, don't they?
那是中指進化的結果。\n是適合快速奔跑的形態呢。=That's the result of an evolved middle toe.\nA shape adapted to a life of sprinting.
說不定，\n人類也會因為腳趾減少而提高跑步速度呢。=Humans could shed toes to speed up, too.
{{A}}，這麼一想，有點期待未來呢！={{A}}, now wouldn't that be a funny future to look forward to!
哦哦！原來人類現在的形態並非是最適合的，\n而是在更遠的未來嗎！=Hoohoo, the human form still has room for improvement, from the sound of it!
如果慾望甚至能改變種子的形態或存在方式，\n那麼未來的人可能會變成意想不到的樣子呢。=If desire alters the shape of a species, \nwho knows what form future humans might take.

接下來～今天也是快樂的理科學習時間～=Another day, another chance to enjoy science～!
今天我們主要來學習聲音的性質！\n首先從複習開始吧～=Today we're discussing the nature of sound.
空氣分子不斷震動傳出聲波，\n當聲波傳到人的耳膜時，就會被感知為聲音。=Waves vibrate through air particles, which vibrate your eardrums and register as sound.
也就是說，能感知到細微的震動，\n正是耳朵的長處。=This ability to detect fine vibrations is what makes the ear so special.
感覺有點不可思議對吧。=Curious, isn't it?
啊，說起耳朵靈敏的生物就是……貓頭鷹！\n它們的耳朵十分特別……有人知道嗎？=Say, that reminds me of a hoot of a question! Anyone know what's special about owl ears?
r:"^好，今天就決定選(.*)同學了！\n來來來，試著回答一下吧。$"="Right, let's see what $1-san has to say! \nGo on, don't be shy, now."
為了能夠更好的狩獵，\n貓頭鷹的耳朵裡有什麼特別的機關呢？=What's so special about owl earholess that helps them with hunting?
耳孔在前面=They face forward
左右耳孔位置不平行=<size\=27>They're positioned unevenly</size>
耳孔很大=They're big
嗯嗯，思考得很深入呢。=Uh-huh, I can see you've thought this through.
但如果目的限定在狩獵的話……\n不太對呢。=But we're talking about hunting here, so...
答案是左右耳孔位置不平行喔～\n我們不是剛剛講了聲波震動嘛？=Their earholes are positioned unevenly! Think back to what we said about vibrations.
沒錯！答案就是左右耳孔位置不平行！\n有在好好思考呢，厲害啦～=Right on the money! Amazing! \nYou really thought this through, didn't you?
耳朵會透過到達左右耳的時間差，\n來判斷聲音的方向。=Their ears can determine a sound's source through horizontal discrepancies...
在此基礎上再加上上下之分，\n便能辨別聲音的高度啦。=...And height through vertical discrepancies.
貓頭鷹會在深夜狩獵，不僅僅靠視覺，\n它還能透過聽覺來判斷高低落差。=Since they're nocturnal hunters, they can use both sight and sound to determine differences in elevation.
它的耳朵在臉部正面，\n所以能聽到的範圍比較窄。=Their forward-facing ears restrict range...
不過貓頭鷹能輕鬆轉頭，完全沒影響！=...But they can whip their heads around no problem to compensate!
嗯哼，生物的構造都特別合理對吧。\n但是偶爾也會讓人大吃一驚哦。=Heheh, the logic of the animal kingdom is something else. Still, it gets a bit spooky from time to time.
比如，看貓頭鷹的耳朵時，\n可以直接看到貓頭鷹的眼球內側。很厲害吧！=Like, did you know you can see the back of an owl's eyeball through their ear hole? Freaky!
r:"^……喂，(.*)，幫我確認下，\n不會吾的身體也是這樣吧……$"="...Hey, $1. Take a look. \nI want to see if my body's the same way."
不，自己的謎底還是自己來揭開吧！\n探究的對象居然在吾自己身上。=Wait, one should confirm one's own mysteries for oneself! Though, I never thought I'd be the subject of my own research.

哎……之前在教職員會議上被罵慘了。\n{{A}}我好沮喪哦。=Yikes, I got chewed out at the staff meeting. I'm a sad specimen of a science scholar.
我總被埋怨說不會看場合說話……=They say I'm thick as a brick. But there's a lot to take in in social situations!
但每個人的感情都千差萬別，\n不同場合規矩也不一樣……太難了。=Each individual's varying emotions, complicated rules of etiquette... It's difficult!
在我老家的歷史名人中，\n有一位叫{{A}}。=There was this local female celebrity, you know, {{A}}. She was a head shrine maiden that traveled the country.
相傳此人是雲遊全國的巫女之首……\n但真實身份似乎是位女忍者。=But rumor has it she was a kunoichi all along.
遍訪全國也是為了收集情報，\n感覺還挺真實的。=She convinced women all over Japan to gather intel for her.
女生往往都擅長交流，\n還見多識廣。=Women can be quite persuasive, you see.
我也想學習一下……=I could learn a thing or two from them...
不過不過，在現代社會裡比起人，\n還是要靠網路不是嘛？=But hey, we've got the internet in the modern age, right?
全世界都已經被光纖連到一起啦！=Fiber-optic cables keep the whole world connected!
r:"^(.*)同學，正好我們對上眼神了。\n那就讓你來思考這個問題。$"="$1-san, I saw you first, so join me for a little thought experiment."
都說網路線將全世界連成了一座地球村，\n可你知道具體是透過什麼連起來的嗎？=Fiber-optic cables may connect us with people around the globe, but do you have any idea how that was done?
海底=Under the ocean
大陸=Over land
心靈感應=Through telepathy
對對，沒錯。\n畢竟連接全世界的最大障礙就是大海了。=Yes, that's exactly it. The sea's always been a major obstacle when connecting the world.
嗯——要是真能實現就好了……\n但目前來說還是有點難度吧？=Well, it'd be interesting if that was true, but it'd be pretty difficult, don't you think?
正確答案是海底。=They ran the cables along the sea floor.
不過……光纖也是由人製造出來連在一起的，\n而且說到底網路要怎麼用完全取決於人……=Even though we're all connected thanks to them, those connections are only as good as the people who use the internet...
{{B}}，{{A}}我也想當忍者……\n可能的話最好把自己整個人都藏起來算了……=I'd love to be a ninja or something. Wouldn't it be so cool to blend into the shadows...?
哎喲，光聽我一個人發牢騷了。\n抱歉，我們來打開教科書……=Whoops. There I go, babbling again. \nSorry, let's jump into the textbooks, shall we?
{{A}}，這{{B}}看起來可真憔悴。=Goodness, how exhausting.
明明這跟學生無關，但也挺麻煩的。=Not exactly a topic to explore with your students, now was that?
但像這樣被外因所左右所困擾，\n可能這才是活得特別像人類呢。=Still, it is very human of him to be pushed so off-topic by unrelated factors.

……所以，現在的日本已經確立了基本人權，\n市民的生活也得到了保障。=...As a result, fundamental human rights were established in modern Japan, and citizens' lives were guaranteed.
「自由權」和「平等權」，保障了言論自由，\n並且禁止歧視，這就是憲法的內容……=In particular, civil liberties and equal rights in our Constitution guarantee freedom of speech and prohibit discrimination...
你們現在認為理所當然的權利，\n在某些時代和國家曾是不存在的，也是事實。=In reality, there were times and countries where the rights you all take for granted did not exist.
17世紀左右……在歐洲有了自由主義的思想，\n但人權問題仍然存在。=Take 17th century Europe, for example. Even though liberal ideas had taken root, there were still problems with human rights.
因身份或者性別而產生的歧視非常普遍，\n甚至在法庭上也無法獲得公平的裁決。=Cases of class-based discrimination, unequal rights for women, and inequitable court rulings were prevalent.
不過，有人間接地與這種不平等抗爭……\n{{A}}！所有人看起來都很困啊。=However, there was one who indirectly resisted this inequality... Tch! You all look like you're falling asleep.
r:"^喂，(.*)！\n你看起來精神不錯，回答一下吧。$"="Hey, $1! You seem to be wide awake. \nTry answering this one."
17世紀，創作了以『復仇』為題材的畫作，\n被譽為巴羅克時期最偉大的女性畫家是誰？=Which 17th century artist created paintings with a revenge theme, and is regarded as the greatest female painter of the Baroque?
米開朗基羅=Michelangelo
多那太羅=Donatello
真蒂萊希=Gentileschi
{{A}}……意外的博學呢。沒錯，答案就是\n阿特蜜希雅·真蒂萊希。=Tch... You're unexpectedly encyclopedic. \nYes, the answer is Artemisia Gentileschi.
答錯了。根本就不符合性別。\n正確答案是阿特蜜希雅·真蒂萊希。=Wrong. For starters, the gender doesn't even match. The correct answer is Artemisia Gentileschi.
她曾遭遇不公正的審判，\n並以自己的遭遇為題材創作了作品……=Gentileschi was unfairly tried in court and released a work based on her own experience...
她的作品充滿強烈的表達力，引起廣泛關注，\n憑藉高超的繪畫技巧逐漸獲得了認可。=Her works were powerful and appealed to public opinion, and she gradually gained mass recognition for her artistic skill.
雖然這些作品無法徹底消除所有的歧視……\n但無疑為眾多女性帶來了勇氣。=It's not as though her works completely eliminated discrimination of course, but they may have given courage to many women.
正是這些偉人的間接活動和對不平等的抗議，\n人權得以逐步建立……=Indirect actions of great figures like Gentileschi empowered everyday people to push for the establishment of human rights...
你們都快要睡著了，看來需要一些喝斥。\n喂，醒醒！繼續上課了！=Looks like you sleepy kids need a wake-up call! Eyes open, people! Class is still in session!
儘管處於不利地位，也為不平等而持續抗爭，\n這才得以跨越時空，昇華為權利嗎……=Even in an unfair situation, people kept fighting against inequality, and their efforts were eventually rewarded...
無論境遇如何，都不能拋棄慾望選擇放棄，\n這也是一種教訓。我們要以此為鑑。=No matter the circumstances, never abandon your desires. A good lesson. We, too, should strive to follow this example.

那麼，今天我們來講稅收制度。=All right, today we're talking about taxes.
關於這個制度，\n福澤諭吉曾舉過一個很精妙的例子。=To quote Yukichi Fukuzawa on the subject...
制定法令來懲惡揚善，\n說白了就是政府所經營的「生意」。="A government enacts laws to control the bad and protect the good. This means that laws are a government's trade."
沒有比「生意」更具資本主義色彩的字眼了。\n百姓等於是用稅金來向政府換購安全。=The "trade" he refers to is a capitalist one.\nCitizens purchase their safety via taxes.
如果做不成這生意，社會會成什麼樣子呢……\n我們可以從18世紀的法國中找到答案。=If this trade is obstructed, well then...\nLet's take a look at 18th-century France.
因不公平的稅政橫行，\n法國百姓連日用品都難以買到。=Unregulated tax collectors had left the common folk unable to afford even the bare necessities.
r:"^這也導致走私等犯罪行為在當地頻頻發生。\n喂，(.*)！$"="People turned to the black market to survive.\nAll right, $1!"
給我從當時的走私商裡說出一個名人來。\n只要學過些法國史，這個問題很簡單吧。=Which of these three was a famous smuggler? Let's see if your French history is up to par.
路易十六=Louis Auguste
路易·菲力普一世=Louis Philippe
路易士·{{A}}=Louis {{A}}
哼……還真是沒認真學習。\n怎麼有一國之君會支持走私的。=Hah! You've got a lot of catchin' up to do. \nYou think the royal family was out smuggling?
正確答案是路易士·{{A}}。\n這個用排除法都選得出來吧。=The correct answer is Louis {{A}}. \nProcess of elimination could tell you as much!
{{A}}……答對了。\n說的就是路易士·{{B}}。=Tch... You're right. \nThe correct answer is Louis {{B}}.
他雖然是罪犯，\n但既然政府保不了百姓周全……=Perhaps when a state fails its people, they no longer have an obligation to obey its laws.
那他身為百姓也沒有守法的義務……\n嗯，理是這個理。=Then as one of the people, \nhe also had no duty to abide by the law...
但政府是不會因此法外開恩的。\n當然，{{A}}最終也被處死了。=Which is not to say that France forgave criminals like {{A}}. No, he was executed.
行了，話題回到日本。\n我國的稅收制度是這樣的……=Now let's bring our discussion back to Japan. \nThe system of taxation in our country is...
吾可不認為被處刑是理所當然。=To me, it seems terribly unfortunate.
為他人而追求慾望卻落得如此下場，\n也太不公了。=For the story of a man like that to end in an execution.
不過……也許他本人也沒覺得有多不幸呢？\n既然選擇了隨心所欲，那也算求仁得仁了。=But perhaps Mandrin himself would have said it was worth it, to live true to his desires...

子不語怪力亂神……\n該句出自孔子的『論語』。=In the "Analects," it's said that Confucius didn't talk on extraordinary things, feats of strength, disorder...
意思就是，人不該妄談曖昧不定、\n詭異無端的事。=...and spiritual beings. In short, Confucius thought it best to not discuss things we don't properly understand.
但另一方面，孔子又是為易學……\n也就是為占卜學做出傑出貢獻的聖人之一……=But Confucius was also supposedly one of the sages who contributed to the creation of I Ching divinat—
看來還有人在一臉迷糊地聽我講課，\n懂不懂尊重……=None of this is making it into your skulls, I see. You kids are trying me today...
r:"^喂，說你呢！(.*)！$"="You there! $1!"
提出子不語怪力亂神的孔子，卻鑽研並奠定了\n占卜學的基礎，這兩點之間是矛盾的嗎？=Confucius said not to speak of the unknown, \nbut studied divination. Is this contradictory?
矛盾=Contradictory
不矛盾=Not contradictory
你看看，根本就沒搞懂這個問題。\n從現在開始，給我提起精神聽課。=I knew this would surpass your understanding.\nNow listen up, kiddies.
正確答案是，不矛盾。\n我來解釋一下為什麼。=There is no contradiction. I'll explain why.
{{A}}……想不到你也明白。\n沒錯，兩者之間並不矛盾。=Tch... So you already knew. \nIndeed, there is no contradiction.
身處當代的我們，\n當然會認為占卜是不切實際的。=Today, divination is seen as mystical nonsense...
但在中國古代，那是一門正經的學問。=But in ancient China, it was a serious field.
十里不同風，百里不同俗。\n不同時代有不同的常識。=Different strokes for different folks.\nCultural standards vary with the era.
今時令人不忍卒視的殘暴行為，\n在當年說不定是項娛樂呢。=The delights of the past might be horrific today.
就比如……英法兩國的公開處刑。\n在日本江戶時代，也有娛樂大眾的一面。=Consider public executions in England and France. Even people in Edo Japan apparently held similar spectacles.
……嗯，這個例子舉得不太妥當。\n但我感覺這個教室裡也有不少人愛聽這個。=That might be a bad example, though. I imagine most of you would enjoy public executions too.
以處刑為樂，作為興趣來講未免太過惡劣……\n畢竟對生命的處決，等同於對慾望的處決。=When one is condemned to death, so too is all one's desire. Who could ever find joy in that?
r:"^我們(.*)可要志存高遠才行。\n知道了嗎，(.*)。$"="We the {{A}} must always act with purpose. You understand, $2?"

{{A}}……不懂社會艱辛的人真是太多了。\n盡是些想不勞而獲、遊戲人生的蠢貨。=You kids have no idea how tough it gets out in the real world. Money doesn't come easy!
我有個前好友，常常將「現在就該多做投資」\n這種蠢話掛在嘴邊。=A former acquaintance of mine thinks if you just start investing, you can make it.
我看他是什麼也不懂。=What a moron.
都給我記住了。\n成人社會沒你們想得那麼好混。=Never forget: society is vicious.
跟錢掛鉤的事，\n就更是難上加難。=Especially when money's involved!
就比如……對，埋藏金。\n總有些渴望一夜暴富的白癡們愛惦記這個。=Take, for example, the storybook way to get rich quick: buried treasure.
r:"^喂，(.*)。\n你要是挖到了埋藏金，會怎麼處理？$"="Eyes up front, $1. What d'you think would happen if you unearthed some buried treasure?"
能全都歸自己=I'd get to keep it all
只能拿一部分=I'd only get part of it
會被全額沒收=It would all be forfeit
{{A}}，想得也太極端了。\n正確答案是，你要和這塊土地的所有者平分。={{A}}, don't think in extremes, kid. In reality, it'd be split between you and the landowner.
{{A}}……算你聰明。\n沒錯，錢要和這塊土地的所有者平分。=Tch, look who's clever today. \nThat's right, you'd split it with the landowner.
就算錢是你自己揮汗如雨挖出來的，到時\n與你素不相識的土地所有者還是會找你平分。=Even if you dig it up with your own two hands, some guy you've never met still gets a share.
不過，想挖埋藏金，\n事先必須征得土地所有者同意。=You would've needed permission from the landowner to dig there in the first place.
對半分也沒什麼難接受的。=So perhaps it's fair.
要是從自家土地裡挖出來，\n錢倒能都歸自己……=From the owner's perspective, it's instant profit...
但你也不想想，\n挖掘費用得花多少呢？=...but they still have to pay the digger.
世上哪有什麼輕輕鬆鬆賺大錢的美事。\n你們出社會混之前，可要牢牢記住這點。=There's no easy money out there, not even in silly fantasy scenarios. Remember that, kids!
該死……\n那小子當初還跟我說什麼穩賺不賠呢。=And yet... I know my former acquaintance will always come out on top.
就知道滿嘴說大話……\n混帳東西。=They always know just what to say... Argh...
{{A}}，真是枯竭的慾望啊。\n只在乎自己得失的私利私慾可真是夢幻一場。=Alas, such withered desire... How fleeting desire directed at oneself can be...
不過跟我們也沒關係。\n讓他儘管憤懣埋怨他人就是了。=Not that it's any of our business, I suppose. No matter how much he may resent someone else.

「天不造人上之人，亦不造人下之人。」\n這是『勸學篇』中有名的一節。="Heaven does not create one man above or below another man." So said Yukichi Fukuzawa in his "An Encouragement of Learning."
雖然只有這句話被大家熟知，\n但它其實是有下文的。=It's often quoted alone like that, \nbut there's more to it.
……現實中，每個人都有差異和高低之分。\n努力學習是為了彌補這種不平等的一種方式。=Fukuzawa actually goes on to say distinctions do exist...
在資本主義社會，\n學到的知識可以轉化為金錢。=And to overcome these inequalities, we must educate ourselves. Under capitalism, the educated will profit.
這也是一種偏實用性的學問……\n概要差不多是這樣的。=Learn practical skills and how to make money.\nThat's the gist of it.
這本文集闡述了如何面對資本主義。=Learn that, and you'll succeed in a capitalist world, Fukuzawa said.
r:"^……(.*)，你們有認真聽課嗎？\n喂！那邊的！(.*)！$"="$1... Are you brats even listening to me!? \nYou there, $2!"
你來回答一下,在『勸學篇』中，\n是如何闡述為什麼要做學問的？=In "An Encouragement of Learning," why does Fukuzawa tell us to pursue education?
為了變聰明=To get smarter
為了賺錢=To make money
為了遵守約定=To keep our promises
……原來你有聽課啊，{{A}}。=So you were listening... {{A}}.
沒錯，『勸學篇』所鼓勵的，\n正是注重實踐的知識，稱之為實學。=Exactly right. "An Encouragement of Learning "advocates for us to understand how to make money—practical education!"
你果然沒聽課啊！\n真是的，所以學生真是不可信。=I knew you weren't listening! Can't even count on students to pay attention in class anymore...
『勸學篇』中鼓勵的，\n正是注重實踐的知識，稱之為實學。="An Encouragement of Learning" advocates for practical education like understanding how to make money.
這可是常識啊，常識。=It's common sense!
好了，那我繼續講。\n你們別走神，小心我一個個點名提問。=Now, on to the next section. You'd all better pay attention, or you'll each be getting a pop quiz!
與賺錢有關的學問是「實學」嗎？\n原來如此，確實很有道理。=So learning how to profit monetarily is called "practical education"? Reasonable enough.
如果吾等也有與怪盜業有關的學問的話，\n或許也可以稱之為「實學」呢。=Perhaps we could consider studies that relate to phantom thievery "practical education" too!

那麼，今天來講犬儒學派的哲學家第歐根尼，\n他衣衫襤褸露宿街頭的故事很有名。=The philosopher Diogenes the Cynic famously dressed in rags and lived on the city streets.
這是因為他不注重物質上的快樂……{{A}}。\n網上有一篇很無聊的報導，我跟你們講講。=All out of disdain for material pleasure... Tch. Oh, and in case the internet misinformed you:
據說房間像垃圾堆一樣的人，\n還有陷入自我麻痺狀態的……嗯……=Yes, there's a mental disorder known as Diogenes syndrome...
這一類的精神病人們，\n被稱為「第歐根尼綜合症」。=...That has symptoms of garbage-hoarding and self-neglect.
脫離社會、儀容不整的樣子，\n表面上或許和第歐根尼相似。=But, while social withdrawal and lack of care for one's appearance can somewhat resemble Diogenes...
但終究只是表面。\n第歐根尼所追求的目標，是完全不同的。=...This is a purely superficial resemblance. Diogenes's teachings were nothing like that.
他提倡的是「從慾望中解放出來」……\n也就是說，擁有不動搖的心，自給自足。=Diogenes argued that we should free ourselves of desire and find happiness within ourselves.
r:"^這個話題跟你們無緣，也許你們不會理解……\n(.*)！你來回答一下。$"="That's probably not the least bit relatable for you bambinos, though... Try this one on for size, $1!"
第歐根尼為了從慾望中解放出來，\n看重的是什麼?=What did Diogenes think we should do to free ourselves from desire?
辯論=Debate
鍛煉=Exercise
{{A}}，完全不對。你竟然給我隨便回答。\n正確答案是精神和肉體的訓練……是鍛煉。=Hah, not even close. Just guessing? The answer is exercise to train the body and mind.
{{A}}……你怎麼會知道，可惡。\n對，精神和肉體的訓練……也就是鍛煉。=Tch, how the heck did you know that? Yes, it was exercise to train the body and mind.
健全的精神源於健全的身體。\n嗯，差不多就是這麼回事。=A healthy mind will dwell in a healthy body. \nOr at least that's the general idea.
因為表面相似，所以就馬上歸為一類，\n同化……這是你們這一代的特徵吧。=But your generation so loves to categorize things based on their superficial appearances...
真是的，\n真厭惡這個無聊的世界。=I truly hate this ridiculous world sometimes.
……嗯，如果被統一分類、同一化，\n確實令人不快。這堂課還真值得學習。=...Hoom, it is indeed unpleasant to be lumped into a group and generalized about like that!
慾望的形式因人而異，\n吾等也必須不被定論所束縛才是啊。=Human desire comes in many shapes, \nso we had best not make assumptions.

好了好了，今天我們來學習一下四大文明。	\n首先從整體印象開始吧。=Today we'll be going over four cradles of civilization of the so-called "Old World." Let's start off with the basics.
美索不達米亞、印度河、尼羅河、黃河。\n大家要聯繫地圖上的地形記住哦。=Here we have Mesopotamian, Indus Valley, Nile Valley and Yellow River civilizations. Try to associate them with their topography.
……話雖如此，其中也有只要知道「名字」	\n就可以立刻記住地形的文明哦。=...There are times when words alone are enough to figure out where on the map a civilization was.
r:"^那麼，從我今天早上吃的菜的數量來考慮……\n(.*)同學，你來回答一下。$"="Based on how many corn flakes were in my cereal this morning... $1-san, why don't you try to answer?"
名字就可以代表地形的文明是指哪個呢?=Which of the following civilization names reflects what the area around it looked like?
美索不達米亞文明=Mesopotamia
印度河文明=Indus Valley
尼羅河文明=Nile Valley
沒錯，你還真知道呢。\n正確答案就是美索不達米亞文明。=That's right. Great job. \nThe correct answer is Mesopotamia.
的確，河的名字直截了當，\n只需要記住河所在的地方就立刻能知道呢。=Well, that does have the name of the river in it, so as long as you know where that is...
但是答錯了。\t\n正確答案是美索不達米亞文明。=But that wasn't what I was looking for.\nMesopotamia is the correct answer.
其他三個文明是以河流命名的文明，	\n但美索不達米亞文明不一樣吧?=The other three are named after their neighboring rivers, but that's not the case with Mesopotamia.
其他三個文明是以河流命名的文明，\n但美索不達米亞文明不一樣吧?=The other three are named after their neighboring rivers, but that's not the case with Mesopotamia.
在希臘語中，美索指的是「間」，\n不達米亞是「河」。=The meso- part means "between" and \n-potamia means "river."
也就是「兩河之間」的意思。=Together, they translate to \n"the land between two rivers."
因為是在底格里斯河和幼發拉底河之間發展\n起來的文明，所以被稱為美索·不達米亞。=It got that name because it was located between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers.
你們看，像這樣只是知道一個「單詞」，\n就可以成為記住其他事情的線索了吧。=See, what did I tell you? Learning a few words probably made it a bit easier to remember the other names too, right?
年輕人總是追求效率什麼的，\n其實看似無關的知識也有起大作用的時候。=You youngsters are always looking for shortcuts, but seemingly irrelevant info can prove its worth at times.
年輕人總是追求效率什麼的，	\n其實看似無關的知識也有起大作用的時候。=You youngsters are always looking for shortcuts, but seemingly irrelevant info can prove its worth at times.
為了增加自己的知識線索，\n拜託你們上課要好好聽講哦。=I'll do my best to give you all more hints to level up your knowledge, so make sure to pay attention in class, okay?
原來如此，從乍一看毫無關係的事情開始，\n尋找潛入的線索。=I see... Having a knack for finding infiltration clues from seemingly unrelated things.
這與吾等怪盜的手法也相通呢。=It's similar to phantom thievery.
{{A}}……所謂學問與怪盜，\n說不定有意外親近的關係呢。=Hoohoo... I never realized education and phantom thievery had so much in common.

好了好了，\n這就是諾曼地登陸的開端。=All right, class... That about does it for the start of the Norman Conquest.
對英法兩國來說都是很重要的事件，\n請大家記住。=It was a major event for the UK and France, \nso be sure to keep it in your memory banks.
這兩個國家的關係啊，是非常密切的。\n甚至連我們也受到了影響呢。=The relationship between those two countries goes very deep. We're still affected by it, even here in Japan after all.
r:"^我看看……從今天的出勤率來考慮，\n(.*)同學，你來回答一下。$"="Let's see, looking at who's in class today... $1-san, why don't you try to answer?"
牛肉之所以被稱為「beef」\n你覺得它來源於哪個國家的語言？=We call the meat of a cow "beef," \nbut where does that word come from?
英國=England
法國=France
美國=America
是啊，怎麼說這也是個英語單詞呢。\n但是答錯了。正確答案是法國。=You'd think so, right? I mean, it is English, after all. But that's incorrect. It's France.
沒錯，答案是法國。\n「beef」一詞其實是法語。=That's right. It's France. \n"Beef" actuall comes from French.
隔著大海只有34公里，\n英法之間語言和文化的混雜意外的多呢。=England and France are only about 21 miles apart, so they've shared quite a bit of language and culture with each other.
30公里大概是從東京站到橫濱站的距離吧。\n是吧？是不是就像鄰居一樣？=For reference, it's about 18 miles from Tokyo to Yokohama. So two countries really are neighbors.
因為歐洲國家之間的距離都很近，\n所以文化的混雜也多有發生。=Because European nations are so close to each other, there are lots of examples of their cultures mixing like this.
如果能掌握好地理位置上的關係，\n歷史事件也會更容易整理一些吧。=Grasping the relationships of the countries on the map makes it a bit easier to understand historical events.
現代史上要記住國家之間的關係是很困難的，\n從現在開始準備的話，考試也就可以安心了。=Modern history is all about political relationships, so the sooner you learn them, the easier your future exams will be.
確實，距離上只是從橫濱到東京，\n但是語言卻不同……這聽起來還真奇妙。=It does sound strange to say that places as close as Yokohama and Tokyo speak different languages.
但反過來也可以說「語言與距離無關」呢。\n{{A}}……你也趁這個機會學學外語怎麼樣？=But I've also heard distance has no relation\nto languages. Hoohoo... Maybe you should take this occasion to learn another language.

好了，今天講大航海時代。歐洲世界可謂是\n經過這一過程，擴大了很多版圖。=All right, class. Today we'll be going over the Age of Discovery, a time of great expansion for European society...
到達新大陸的哥倫布，開拓印度航線的\n達·伽馬，以及環遊世界的麥哲倫。=...when Columbus arrived in the New World, Vasco da Gama pioneered a route to India, and Magellan circumnavigated the globe.
關於這次稱得上輕率的冒險的動機，\n麥哲倫說「最開始是為了辛香料」。=Spices were the reason Magellan gave when asked what motivated his reckless journey.
r:"^我想想……從剛才站在電線上的小鳥數量看，\n(.*)同學。你試著回答一下。$"="Based on the number of birds I saw outside on the telephone lines earlier... why don't you try to answer, $1-san?"
為什麼麥哲倫在環遊世界的時候，\n是以辛香料為動機的？=Why did spices play a major role in Magellan's expedition around the world?
因為料理會變得更美味=They could improve cooking
因為可以成為船的動力=They could power ships
因為可以賺錢=<size\=30>They could make money</size>
是啊，要是那樣就好了……\n完全答錯了。答案是貿易。因為可以賺到錢。=Sure, it'd be nice if that was true... but it's completely wrong. Money is the answer.
沒錯，透過貿易可以獲得高收益。\n這正是開拓航線的原動力。=That's right. Huge profits to be had from trade were the driving force for sea route development.
當我們談論那些開創新事物的人時，\n人們常說他們的目的是夢想或浪漫。=When someone tries something new, we often say it was to achieve their dream or satisfy their sense of adventure.
但是，創新首先要有錢才行。\n沒有錢的話，什麼也做不了。=But the real motivating factor is money.\nNothing can be done without it.
錢可以填飽肚子，可以找到住處，\n但夢想和浪漫不能滿足這些吧？=Money buys you food and housing, but what do dreams and adventurous spirit get you?
雖然是個缺乏夢想的話題……\n但實際上就是這樣的。=It's kind of sad, but it's the truth.
即使在大航海的冒險時代也一樣。=It was the same for the explorers in the Age of Discovery.
……夢想和浪漫是填不飽肚子的嗎？\n但也有光靠金錢無法滿足的東西。=They couldn't fill their stomachs with dreams and adventure. That said, there are also things money can't buy.
對吾來說，找到一條兩者兼顧的道路，\n希望有這樣強烈的慾望才好啊。=Personally, I'd prefer a desire so strong that it would give me the means to be satisfied in both ways.

好好，就這樣秦始皇出於戰爭的目的，\n而建造了「萬里長城」……=So, Emperor Qin Shi Huang is said to have built the original Great Wall to protect the people against invaders...
經過後續數代王朝的反復修繕、遷建，\n秦長城最終才變成了今天的樣子。=His wall was repaired and relocated during several later dynasties before it took shape as the Great Wall as we know it today.
現存的大多是明長城。\n據說位置也比秦長城向南延伸了非常多=Most of the surviving sections are from the Ming Dynasty and located further south than\nin the Qin Dynasty.
現存的大多是明長城。\n據說位置也比秦長城向南延伸了非常多。=Most of the surviving sections are from the Ming Dynasty and located further south than\nin the Qin Dynasty.
那麼……作為世界遺產聞名的長城，\n大家知道它的實際長度是多少嗎？=In Chinese, the Great Wall is known as "the 10,000 li-long wall." Does anyone know how long this world heritage site really is?
r:"^我看看……以現在的秒針位置來看……\n(.*)同學，請回答。$"="Oh, would you look at the time. \n$1-san, it's your time to shine."
萬里長城，真的有「萬里」嗎？=A li is also known as the Chinese mile, but would that make the Great Wall 10,000 miles long?
根據時代不同=It depends
的確，這種時候真想斷言呢。	\n但是，事實並非如此。=I understand wanting to give a clear-cut answer. But there isn't one this time.
沒錯。\n如何定義它是個重要的問題。=Precisely. What is considered one "li" depends on where and when you are in history.
雖然在日本，1里等於3.9公里。\n但中國秦代的1里……長約400公尺。=In present-day Japan, one li is about 2.44 miles, but in Qin China, one li was a little over a quarter of a mile.
相差很大吧？而且長城的長度根據\n是否算上了高山和低谷，也會發生變化。=Quite the difference, right? The distance also changes depending on whether or not you include the mountains and valleys.
在2012年，它被確定為21196公里。\n如果用里來考慮，長城足足有1.2萬里。=In 2012, the Great Wall was measured at a length of approximately 13,170 miles... That equals a whopping 53,000 Chinese li.
這麼一想，果然不能稱之為萬里……\n也就是說這件事無法用是黑還是白來斷言。=Which means it's not the "10,000 li-long wall" after all. So, in short, there isn't really a clear-cut answer on this one.
{{A}}，這麼出題有點狡猾呢。\n這種題不會出現在考試中的，就別埋怨我啦。={{A}}! A very tricky question, indeed. \nDon't worry, though. It won't be on the exam.
……原來如此，根據觀者的立場和知識，\n是否正確也會發生變化嗎？=I see. Whether it's correct or not depends on the viewer's outlook and knowledge.
這的確是個狡猾的問題，\n不過也確實學到了知識，就原諒她吧。=That was certainly a duplicitous problem, but I'll let it slide for the knowledge it provided.

安靜安靜，那我們……今天來從古希臘講起。\n這個歷史階段，要記的相關重點有很多。=All right, class. Today we'll be moving onto Ancient Greece. There's really a lot to learn about and from this period in history.
畢竟古希臘為西方文化留下了深遠的影響。	\n而且全是些時至今日也舉足輕重的影響。=It had a huge impact on Western culture. \nMuch of it still remains relevant to this day.
比如大家在數學課上學到的畢氏定理。	\n該定理就是古希臘學者畢達哥拉斯發現的。=For instance, the Pythagorean theorem in math. It was discovered by the ancient Greek Pythagoras.
除此之外還有許多……我想想。=There are other examples as well, \nbut let's see if any of you know some.
r:"^結合今天的濕度與學號點名……\n(.*)同學。$"="Using today's humidity and your student numbers, let's ask... $1-san."
憂鬱（Melancholy）一詞的本意，其實是指\n人體某一器官的分泌液，你覺得是什麼器官？=The word "melancholy" historically referred to a secretion... Which organ did that secretion come from?
大腦=The cerebrum
胃=The stomach
肝臟=The liver
有道理，提到與憂鬱有關的器官，	\n你會想到這個答案，也是情有可原。=Well, yes, that is one of the organs associated most with feelings of great sadness.
可惜回答錯誤。正確答案是肝臟。	\n準確來說，是肝臟所分泌的膽汁。=But you're a bit off the mark. The answer is the liver. To be precise, melancholy is the bile secreted from there.
沒錯，答案是肝臟。	\n準確來說，是肝臟所分泌的膽汁。=That's right. It's the liver. To be precise, melancholy is the bile secreted from there.
這個詞源於四體液說……=Melancholy was originally used in humorism...
這個學說認為，\n體液均衡會影響人體健康與個人氣質。=A medical theory claiming unbalanced humors affect health and temperament.
而憂鬱的起因在於黑膽汁分泌過剩，	\n黑色即melan，膽汁即choly。=Melancholy is an excess of black bile... \nMelan- means "black," and -choly means "bile."
在七宗罪的前身——八樞要罪中，\n憂鬱可是赫然在列的。=Sadness can be a precursor to the seven deadly sins.
所以人們可能也曾對黑膽汁諱莫如深。=So black bile was not looked upon favorably.
各位接受的是當代知識教育，	\n這個學說在你們聽來一定很荒唐吧。=Knowing what we know now, \nthis theory must sound like a joke, right?
但是，在19世紀病理解剖學誕生之前，	\n人們是一直支持該學說的。=But this theory was supported until the birth of morbid anatomy in the 19th century.
在我們認知中稀鬆平常的常識……=The basis for what we consider common sense has...
放在歷史長河中，\n可都是剛發現沒多久的新鮮論調。=Historically speaking, only been discovered relatively recently.
……原來如此，有道理。=Hoom... That has a point.
也就是說今時今日的常識，\n在未來也可能被新的發現所改寫。=Current common knowledge could easily be shelved by new discoveries.
哼哼，也不知新發現會促成何種慾望。\n真想親眼見證一番。=Hoohoo, what desires would lead to such discoveries? I'd like to see for myself someday.

安靜安靜，那麼……今天來講古羅馬。	\n提到羅馬，我們總會想起一句名言。=All right, class... Today we'll be heading to ancient Rome. There's a famous expression about Rome.
條條大路通羅馬。	\n彼時當地的交通網都是以羅馬為中心的。=It goes "all roads lead to Rome." It refers to the road network in and around the area.
最終不只羅馬，連法國、英國、甚至非洲\n都被納入其交通網絡之中，十分驚人。=But these roads don't just lead to Rome. They extended all the way to France, England, and even Africa.
而且這些道路不僅僅只是能走到就行。	\n為了更便於使用，人們下了不少功夫。=Measures were taken to make transit on them easier. However, these roads were more than mere connections.
我看看，\n那就結合今天的氣溫與學號來點名吧……=Let's see... Based on today's high and your student numbers...
下列材料中，哪一樣沒有被用於鋪設羅馬街\n道？給你個提示……這材料並不耐久。=What material was not used for Roman roads? Here's a hint... It doesn't last long.
木材=Wood
岩石=Rock
水泥=Cement
沒錯，他們並沒有選用木材。	\n木頭經久是會腐朽的嘛。=That's right. They never used wood. \nThe reason is because it rots quickly.
嗯，會這麼想也不奇怪。\n我很理解你的心情。=Yes, you'd be inclined to think that. I understand exactly where you're coming from.
但回答錯誤。沒有被選用的是木材。	\n木頭經久是會腐朽的嘛。=But I'm afraid that's not right. They never used wood. The reason is because it rots quickly.
人們用水泥與大小不均的岩石，\n鋪疊了擁有四層構造的道路。=They increased the roads' stability...
這不僅能提高路面的穩定性……=By using four layers of cement and stones of various sizes...
同時還考慮到積雨問題，\n將道路中央稍稍墊高，=To prevent flooding...
甚至在兩側鋪設了排水溝。=The center was elevated and drainage ditches were added to both sides.
道路的耐用度極高，\n據說在時隔2000年的今天……=That these roads are still in use after 2000 years is a testament to their durability...
義大利的部分地區仍在使用當年的路段。=Some parts of Italy still use them.
看來羅馬帝國也是深知，若想統治廣袤國土，\n國家的基礎設施建設是十分重要的。=The Roman Empire knew how important infrastructure was to controlling their expansive territory.
{{B}}我雖然姓{{A}}，但最喜歡的\n還是平坦的道路， 因為走著不會累呀。=Although my name, {{A}}, may give off the image of valleys and mountains, but I'm honestly not one for hiking.
那個年代就已經用水泥鋪路了？\n施工水準比起現代也毫不遜色啊！！=Hoom! So, they really used cement back then? They were as sophisticated as people are today!
一定是羅馬人的慾望驅使他們成此偉業。\n果然，慾望會促使人進化……=Could the Romans' desires have spurred them to be so? Desires truly drive people to improve...

仔細一看，你還是挺有氣質的嘛。=On closer inspection, \nyou've got a pretty solid look.
你是誰？=Who are you?
什麼東西！？=What!?

Choice 1
……嗯，意識還很清醒。=...Hmm, still fully conscious.
Choice 2
這也算是正常反應吧。=That's a natural reaction.

逐漸產生「求知慾」，是個好兆頭。\n{{A}}，這才值得吾親自來見你。=You're developing a "desire for knowledge", a good sign indeed. {{A}}, this alone makes my visit worthwhile.
r:"^吾知道你的名字，\n是(.*)對吧？$"="I know your name.\nIt's $1, right?"
叫吾{{A}}就好。\n記得發音要充滿敬意啊。=You may call me {{A}}, ensure you say it with the reverence it deserves.
令人在意的事情太多了……=Too many to care about...
嗯……\n你不叫吾的……名字嗎。=Hmm...\nWill you not speak my name?
奇怪。按人類的標準來說，\n吾剛才的自我介紹應該是完美的啊……=Strange. By human standards, my introduction should've been flawless...
……算，算了。\n你現在想必很困惑吧。=...Never mind. \nYou're still confused, I take it.
但是現在時間有限。\n吾就單刀直入地說了。=But time is limited. \nI'll explain this plainly.
這裡不是你所熟悉的現實世界……\n而是另一個空間，「{{A}}」。=This is not the real world you know... but another dimension, "{{A}}".
人類的集體無意識……簡而言之，\n指的是「大眾的心靈世界」，這樣能理解嗎？=The collective unconscious of humanity... In short, think of it as "the mental world of the masses", does that resonate?
在如今的現實世界中，\n各種各樣的「慾望」正在逐漸消失……=In the real world now, all sorts of "desires" are withering away...
這個世界一副看起來隨時要崩潰的樣子，\n也是因為這個原因。=This world ominously appears to verge on collapse, and that's precisely why.
慾望喪失……？=Loss of desires...?
為什麼會這樣……=Why is this happening...
……你現在懷有的「求知慾」也是如此……=...The same goes for that "desire for knowledge" you're feeling right now...
如果它們全都在不知不覺中，\n被人給「盜取」了呢？=What if they're all being "stolen" right under our noses?
……信不信由你。=...Believe it or not.
但是，你的慾望同樣也被「盜取」了。\n從現在開始，就由吾來引導你擺脫困境……=But your desires have been stolen as well. From now on, I'll guide you out of this mess...
……似乎被發現了。\n吾等換個地方再說。=...Looks like we've been spotted. Let's find somewhere else to talk.
首先要做的是離開這裡。\n之後就邊走邊說吧。=First things first, let's get out of here. We can talk as we go.
就算你這麼說……=Even if you say so...
被發現了是指？=Being spotted?
好了，快跟上。\n現在把吾當成同伴就好。=Alright, hurry up. For now, just treat me a teammate.
雖然還不太明白……但感覺非走不可了。=Although I still don't quite understand... I feel like I have to leave.

之前也說過了，在現實世界中，\n人們的「慾望」正在被盜取。=Like I said before, in the real world, people's "desires" are being stolen.
你沒有感覺到嗎？=Don't you feel it?
有些人覺得「這也沒辦法吧」就放棄了，\n違背自身想法，所以導致意志漸漸消失。=Some people think, "It can't be helped" and just give up. They go against their own beliefs, losing their will.
雖然提到慾望這個詞，容易有負面的印象，\n但它也是「生存的原動力」。=The word "desire" might carry a negative connotation, but it's also the very force that "drives us to live".
如果選擇放棄，或者慾望被誰給盜取……\n人類究竟會變成什麼樣子……=If you choose to give up, or if someone steals your desires... What will become of humanity...?
你應該也親眼看到了吧？\n喪失最後一絲希望的人，會做出什麼事。=You've seen it for yourself, haven't you?\n What people do when they lose their last shred of hope.
……當然，\n這並不是說世界馬上就會終結。=...Of course, that doesn't mean the world is going to end right away.
但這一狀況，確實在一步步腐蝕著人類，\n將世界推向末日。=But this situation is slowly eating away at humanity, dragging the world closer to ruin.
而「慾望被盜取」的原因是……=And the reason "desires are being stolen" is...
{{A}}，果然還是要來礙事……={{A}}, of course, they had to show up\nand ruin things...
他們是「陰影」，簡單來說就是敵人，\n是來取吾等性命的。=They are "Shadows". Basically, they are enemies, here to kill us.
這些傢伙沒有善惡之分，\n只會遵循慾望攻擊人類。=These guys don't care about good or evil, they just act on their desires and attack humans.
的確有違和感……感覺就像是，\n失去了心中重要的「一些東西」。=I can feel the sense of dissonance... It feels like losing "something" that is important.
想起了一些事情……=Remembered something...
總覺得發生過……=<size\=23>Feels like this happened before...</size>
這些傢伙是？=Who are these guys?
但是，它們還沒有呈現出本來的樣子。\n這是因為受到了現實中「某人」的強烈影響。=But they haven't shown their true forms yet. That's because they're heavily influenced by "someone" in the real world.
車站周圍的慾望會陷入枯竭，\n難道也是因為它們……？=Is the lack of desires around the station... because of them...?
莫非……=Could it be...
不會吧……=No way...
{{A}}，這些陰影……={{A}}, these Shadows...
正是人類慾望被盜取的原因之一！=That's one of the reasons people's desires are being stolen!
總之，你快逃吧！=Anyway, you run away!

「無慾」有時會導致你放棄自己=A lack of desire can lead to losing sight of yourself...
欺騙自己 選擇忘卻="The incident was fake". "Forget it".

現在 再問你一次=Once again, let me ask you.
繼續作為「被盜取」的一方 放棄未來 甚至捨棄「生命」=Continue being "stolen" from, giving up on your future and even your "life".
這就是你的選擇嗎=Is that a good choice?

這就對了 我就是想聽到這樣的選擇=That's right... That's the choice I wanted to hear!
難道=No way.

{{A}}……與之前相比，\n完全變成另一個人了，不錯。={{A}}... You're like a completely different person now, not bad.
這是迎擊的姿態。\n為了殺掉吾等，它們要來真的了。=That's an attacking stance. \nThey really intend to kill us.
如果你不想死，\n那就用你手中的武器……=If you don't want to die,\nthen use the weapon in your hand...
斬碎敵人！=And slice them into pieces!

Choice 1
沒錯，\n就是你剛才展現出來的那股力量。=Exactly, I'm talking about that power you just displayed.
Choice 2
如果你的力量有名字的話，那這就是了。=If your power has a name, then this is it.
{{A}}指的是「另一個自己」……\n當人類選擇直面自身真正慾望時，即會顯現。={{A}} is the "other self"... It is revealed when one faces their own true desires.
在這個慾望被榨取的世界中，\n每個人都很難找到自我……=In this world where desires are constantly being drained, it's hard for anyone to even find themselves...
{{A}}，果然吾沒有看走眼，\n你也許會成為這個世界的希望。={{A}}, indeed, my judgment was not mistaken, you may yet become the hope of this world.
你再也不是「被盜取慾望」的一方了。=You are no longer on the side that's "being stolen".
趕緊走吧。=Let's hurry.
這裡還是<color\=#ff0000>{{A}}</color>。\n隨時都會遭到陰影的襲擊。=This is still <color\=#ff0000>{{A}}</color>. A place where Shadows could attack at any moment.
陰影究竟是？=What are Shadows?
吾知道你還有很多疑問……\n但眼下離開這裡是首要的。=I know you have many questions... but escaping is our top priority right now.
吾若死於此地，\n也就無法回答你的問題了。=If I die here, \nI won't be able to answer your question.

Choice 2
{{A}}，讓吾按順序說！\n不要那麼急性子。={{A}}, let me explain it step by step! Don't be so impatient.
首先，{{A}}中的服裝之所以會變化，\n是由於本人擁有強烈的「慾望意志」。=First, in the {{A}}, the transformation of one's garments symbolizes their formidable "will and desires".
再者，當吾等被陰影認知為敵人時，\n便會換上的心之鎧甲……你可以這樣理解。=When the Shadows mark us as enemies, we clad ourselves in the armor of the heart... You may see it thus.
……嗯，吾也不是什麼都知道。\n也有人說這彰顯的是反叛的精神。=...Hm, I don't know everything myself. Some even say it's an embodiment of the spirit of rebellion.
現實世界和{{A}}中的服裝不同，\n就是因為以上理由……=The reason our forms differ between reality and the {{A}}... is as I've described.

……對了，今天讓我們在{{B}}集合，\n那應該是有工作的事要說吧，{{A}}？=So, {{A}}, are we here because you have something to tell us?
嗯，想跟大家討論下一個目標的事項，\n不過吾目前還沒有頭緒……=Yes. It's about our next target. Or rather, it will be once we've found them...
那首先要做的，\n就是找到下一個{{B}}和{{A}}吧。=Well, the first thing we have to do is figure out who the next {{A}} is, right?
像{{A}}那樣的壞蛋……\n應該還有５個對吧。=There're still five more scumbags like {{A}} out there.
在此吾有個提議，\n前些日子，吾等已奪取{{A}}……=Speaking of which, we should be able to use the Treasure we secured from him to aid our search.
那麼，\n吾等應該也能進入新的{{A}}區域了。=It should allow us entrance to a new area of {{A}}.
意思是下一個目標也在那裡嗎，\n那等今天放學就趕緊去看看吧。=And that's where our next target's Palace will be? Good enough for me. Let's go right after school today.
嗯， 一旦準備就緒，\n就召集大家吧，隊長。=Right. Call everyone together when you're ready to head out, Leader.

……新{{A}}？這還沒到新學期吧？=New teacher? In the middle of the school year?
嗯，我聽{{A}}說的，\n好像……還不算是普通的{{B}}？=Yeah. {{A}} told me. \nApparently he's not a regular teacher.
不是普通的{{A}}？那是什麼意思？=Not a regular teacher? What does that mean?
我也不清楚，據說並不是來教課的……\n是什麼來著……=I'm not really sure, but I don't think he's going to be teaching classes.

抱歉，午休時間召集各位{{B}}過來，\n我是<color\=#ff0000>{{A}}</color>。=Sorry to interrupt your lunch, teachers.\nI'm <color\=#ff0000>{{A}}</color>.
是這樣，從今天開始，這位……=This is Akashi-sensei.
{{A}}，將來我校就任。=He'll be working here starting today.
我是<color\=#ff0000>{{A}}</color>，各位還{{B}}。=I am <color\=#ff0000>{{A}}</color>, \nI look forward to working with you all.
我是<color\=#ff0000>{{B}}</color>，各位還{{A}}。=I am <color\=#ff0000>{{A}}</color>, \nI look forward to working with you all.
{{A}}，\n是校理事會安排的教育顧問。={{A}} is an educational consultant sent by the school board.
哦，教育顧問……？=Educational consultant...?
是的，這個頭銜可能聽起來很陌生，\n所以請允許我先簡單地說明一下。=Yes. It's probably an unfamiliar term, \nso allow me to give a brief explanation.
我想各位應該也有所了解，\n近來，教師過勞已成為了社會問題。=As I'm sure you all know, the overworking of teachers has become a major issue in recent years.
除了上課，{{A}}還要負責不少事務性工作，\n或是兼顧社團顧問等等，休息時間難以保證。=Between their classroom responsibilities, administrative tasks, and club advising, they don't get enough time off.
另外，還要應對校內各種問題、家長投訴……\n很多{{A}}在精神方面想必已是疲累不堪。=Then there are problems on campus and parental complaints. It all takes a heavy mental toll.
確實～事實如此！閱卷之類的事還要帶回家，\n大叔我啊，真的快累死了～！=You said it! Do you know how often I have to take work home with me? I could drop dead any minute!
忙也就算了……\n應對家長的電話才讓人感到窒息……=I gave up and accepted the fact that I'll always be busy at this job, but dealing with parent calls is a serious pain.
看來各位都感同身受。=I see you all have all have some problems you're dealing with.
實際上，近年來教師的離職率越來越高，\n有志成為教師的人數也逐年降低。=Many teachers are leaving the profession these days, and few are lining up to replace them.
因此，理事會旨在事態日趨嚴重之前，\n派我前來協調、解決這一問題。=The school board sent me to help address these problems at the source.
哦哦～！=Oh!
從今天起，我會在校內進行實地考察，\n找出工作的冗餘內容，仔細查明問題所在……=From today on, I'll be working to identify problems like unnecessary work and eliminating them.
致力於創造一個……\n使{{A}}得以專注於學生教育的環境。=The goal is to create an environment where instructors can focus on teaching their students.
是所謂的「工作方式改革」吧。=So you'll be instituting work reforms?
靠這玩意要是能讓工作變輕鬆一些，\n那倒也不賴……=If I thought it'd actually make my life easier, I'd be all for it.
我會在明天全體師生出席的晨會上，\n以臨時教育顧問的身份介紹{{A}}。={{A}} will be introduced to the\nstudents tomorrow as a temporary educational advisor.
謝謝，我也想聽聽校內學生們的意見。=Thank you very much. I'm looking forward to hearing what the students have to say.
另外，各位{{A}}在教室上課期間，\n我可能會前來叨擾，這一點還請諒解。=And please be aware that I may need to visit your classrooms during your lessons.
如果這樣能為我們的工作減負，\n我們絕對歡迎啊，對吧？{{A}}。=If it means making less work for us, then you're more than welcome. Right, {{A}}?
是的，這樣的話，\n也能有更多的時間和學生溝通……=Yes. If it means being able to focus more of our attention on the students...
等一下，{{A}}，就算有時間，\n也不能在放學後「擅自家訪」之類的哦？=I hope you're not thinking of making more unauthorized home visits, {{A}}.
等一下，{{A}}，就算有時間，\n也不能在放學後「擅自家訪」之類的哦！=I hope you're not thinking of making more unauthorized home visits, {{A}}.
昨天可是有家長投訴呢，\n說「班主任沒打招呼突然就來家訪了！」……=We received a complaint from a parent yesterday saying their child's homeroom teacher just showed up at their doorstep!
……那個學生，最近經常曠課，\n擅自早退的情況也越來越多。=That student has excessive absences and frequently leaves school early.
我跟學生家長打過很多次電話，\n但都聯繫不上，所以就直接去見他們了。=I called the parents several times, but they didn't answer, so I went to speak with them.
為什麼你要跑到人家家裡去，\n這會讓人為難的吧！=You went to their house for that!? Do you not see how inappropriate that is!?
……學生需要家長和{{A}}雙方的共同關注。=Students need to be looked after at home and at school.
而且，單說不接班主任電話這一點，\n說明家長在這方面很可能存在一些問題。=If a parent consistently ignores calls from their child's teacher, it can be indicative of problems at home.
如果學生無法專注學業是家庭原因導致，\n我們當{{A}}的怎麼可以放任不管……！=If his homelife is the cause of his issues at school, then it's up to us teachers to intervene!
好了好了，請停一下，\n先說到這裡吧，這位{{A}}……=All right, all right. That's enough...
……你用的、那個是什麼？=What is that?
啊，失禮，這是智慧眼鏡，\n可以認為是手機的眼鏡版。=Oh, my apologies. These are smart glasses. Basically a smartphone for your eyes.
我剛才，\n只是在確認事先拿到的各位的資料。=I was just using them to check the roster I was given.
好吧……=I... see...
{{A}}，過於干涉學生的家庭，\n可是ＮＧ的哦，這是違規行為呢。=You can't go to parent's homes, {{A}}. It's against regulations.
什麼意思！？=What!?
尤其是擅自家訪的問題，此前已有不少學生，\n出現迫於家訪的壓力而拒絕上學的案例。=Especially impromptu visits. Putting pressure on families can create more resistance toward attending school.
即便確有必要，也應有學校心理諮詢師隨行，\n以幫扶小組的形式來處理問題。=If needed, the school counselor and other qualified professionals should deal with the situation.
就是因為不想讓事態發展到那個地步，\n所以才要先跟學生家長面對面溝通吧……！=I want to resolve things before they become that dire. That's why I need to meet with the parents!
哎呀……\n這可真像是昭和時代的老派教育方式阿。=Sigh... \nThat's not how things are done anymore.
當下這個時代，{{A}}只要去到學生家裡，\n這就表明不是個小問題。=Just having a teacher come to your house is a big deal these days.
再就是，如果太關注一個學生，\n你不認為這樣是對其他學生的忽視嗎？=If you pay too much attention to one student, \nyou'll end up neglecting the others, won't you?
可是，那個學生需要大人的說明，\n他要是連在自己家都沒有容身之處的話……=But children need adults to look out for them. If he doesn't feel safe at home...
不管怎麼樣，\n我不能放任不管！=I can't just leave him to fend for himself!
好了好了，真是的！說來說去又繞回來了，\n總之，就按{{A}}剛才說的那樣！=All right already! We're going in circles here. \n{{A}} agrees with me!
從今以後，不准擅自進行家訪！\n在校外不准你見學生！明白了嗎！？=From now on, no unsolicited home visits! Avoid meeting students outside of school, period! Are we clear!?
其他{{A}}也都注意一下，\n就這樣，請各位回去工作吧，散會。=That goes for the rest of you too. \nNow get back to work, everyone.
那我也先告辭了，\n今後還{{B}}，{{A}}。=I'll be off now. I'm looking forward to working with you, {{A}}.
{{A}}……跟情報顯示的那樣，\n是個很適合當做「誘餌」的女性啊……={{A}}... My intel was right. \nShe'll make for perfect fodder.
有必要聯繫一下那個人了，\n就說一切順利吧。=I should let them know. \nHopefully everything goes to plan.

同學們請安靜一下，\n有件事想通知大家，關於明天……=Everyone, be quiet. \nI have an announcement about tomorrow...
社團活動，懶得去啊……=Club's got me so burnt out.
哎呀，今天去不去卡拉OK？=Hey, wanna go to karaoke today?
好了，大家先安靜下來，\n我現在是有重要事情要說明哦？=Settle down. I said I have something to announce.
好了，大家先安靜下來，\n我現在是有重要事情要說明哦！=Settle down. I said I have something to announce.
都說了給我安靜一點！=I said pipe down, didn't I!?
……明天早上的晨會，\n全體師生都要到場，注意別遲到。=There will be a school-wide morning assembly tomorrow, so don't be late.
今天就到這裡，\n大家回去路上注意安全。=Well, that's it for today. \nEveryone, get home safe and sound.
好嚇人……=Yikes...
她想要幹嘛啊……=The hell was that?
……{{A}}心情不太好嗎。=Seems like {{A}}'s in a bad mood.
嚇我一跳=That's surprising
也怪不得她生氣=You can't blame her
嗯啊，雖然大家一直說話是不對，\n但突然這麼一吼真的會被嚇到。=Well, I feel bad everyone was being so noisy, but it was kinda startling the way she blew up like that.
也是，大家都不聽{{A}}說什麼，\n還一直安靜不下來。=Well, yeah. Nobody listened to her.
{{A}}她啊，有時候會變得很可怕對吧？\n搞不好……她是哪裡有毛病啊？={{A}}'s kinda scary, huh? \nMaybe she's got anger issues.
犯病的{{B}}什麼的太嚇人了吧。\n搞不好是{{A}}啊。=You don't wanna mess with a hot-head teacher like that. What a {{A}}.
對對對！{{B}}就是{{A}}吧！=You're right! {{B}}'s a total {{A}}!
{{A}}一走，你們就說她壞話？=You wait till {{A}} leaves the room to start bad-mouthing behind her back?
……勸你們少幹這種丟人的事。=Don't be so pathetic.
喲，今天去不去？{{A}}。=What're we doin' today? {{A}}?
{{A}}，你剛才還一副不好惹的樣子……=Uh, we just gonna blaze past your spectacular entrance?
……我只是看不慣他們那樣，\n有意見就當面說。=That cowardly crap just pisses me off. If you're gonna talk shit, say it to the person's face.
那，怎麼說？要是能去下一個區域了，\n我們就去看看。=So, what do you think? I say if we can get to the next area, let's give it a go.

----------
Chapter 3 Mementos New Area
----------
鑒於吾等目前已經得手了{{A}}，\n下一個區域……第3區域，應該也能進去了。=Now that we have {{A}}, we should be able to enter the next area.
總之先去到第２區域的最深處吧，\n走吧，WONDER。=First we should head to the furthest edge of the second area. Let's go, Wonder.
哇，打開了！=Whoa! It opened!
確認到新的區域，開始更新導航情報。=A new area has been confirmed.\nUpdating guidance information.
{{B}}……喂，剛才說話的，\n是{{A}}嗎？=Wait. Did the {{A}} just talk?
嗯嗯，只要有新的能去的地方，\n導航應該就會更新資料。=Oh, yeah. Apparently it keeps track of when we discover new places too.
啊～好厲害，就是有點嚇人……=Ah... That's cool and all, but isn't it kinda creepy?
在沒有訊號的{{A}}居然還能啟動，\n這個手機應用到底是什麼來頭……=The hell's with this app anyway? There's no reception in the {{A}}, but it works just fine.
……這麼一說確實啊？\n之前沒想太多就直接用了，真挺神奇的。=Oh. True. I didn't really think about it before, but that's super weird.
而且不知不覺就出現在手機裡了，\n不管怎麼刪都刪不掉……=It just appeared on my phone one day and kept coming back every time I deleted it.
CATTLE知道些什麼嗎？\n關於這個手機應用。=Do you know something about it, Cattle?
唔，吾也搞不明白怎麼回事，\n或許找回記憶後能知道答案……=No, I only know as much as you do. It could be part of the memories I lost.
目前吾已知的是，只有擁有強烈慾望的人，\n才能使用{{A}}……僅此而已。=Only those with strong desires can use the {{A}}. That's the extent of my knowledge on the subject.
那就是說，\n我們對它完全不了解吧……=So basically, we know nothing.
CATTLE都不明白的話，\n總覺得突然有點害怕起來了………=It's kinda freaky that even Cattle doesn't understand it.
還有這個圖示，感覺有點噁心啊，\n這個是……蛇？=And look at this creepy icon! \nWhat is that, a snake?
唔，要說這種圓環狀的蛇形圖案，\n其中「銜尾蛇」很有名呢。=Hoom. The looped snake motif reminds me of an ouroboros.
銜尾蛇？=Ouroboros?
是指吞食自己的尾巴，\n從而形成圓環的一種蛇。=A snake biting its own tail to form a circle.
起始和終結合而為一，不會結束的永恆……\n常用來象徵完整無缺的意義。=It devours itself and is reborn in an eternal loop. \nIt symbolizes the cyclical nature of the universe.
……但是這隻蛇，\n並沒有咬自己尾巴啊？=But this snake isn't biting its tail.
哦？啊，還真是。=Hoo? Ah, I suppose you're right.
那這隻並不是銜尾蛇，\n而只是個蛇怪嗎？=So it's not an ouroboros, \nbut just a regular snake monster?
似乎有深層含義=<size\=24>It may have a deeper meaning</size>
難道畫錯了？=<size\=30>Did they draw it wrong?</size>
搞不懂……=I don't get it
深層含義……指的是？=What kinda deeper meaning?
啊，原來你也不知道啊……=You don't even know, do you?
感覺不太可能吧……{{A}}，說到底，\n這真的是「人」做出來的東西嗎……？=I don't think that's it... Hang on a sec, are we assuming a person made this?
哎呀，說不定只是我們想多了，\n可能根本沒什麼含義吧。=Maybe we're just overthinking, \nand it doesn't really mean anything.
唔，不過說不定就沒什麼特殊含義，\n想來想去可能也是在浪費時間。=Me neither. It probably doesn't mean anything. No reason to overthink it.
不管怎麼說，多虧有它，\n才能給{{A}}那種人{{B}}。=But that doesn't change the fact that this app helped change {{A}}'s heart.
對，{{A}}的事情也是，\n真的要感謝{{B}}啊。=Yeah, {{A}}'s too. \nThanks for that, {{B}}.
那不糾結這個問題啦，\n快點找到下一個{{A}}，給他改心吧！=Anyway, now we've gotta find the next {{A}} and change their heart ASAP!
沒錯，吾這就來聽聽，\n這個區域內各種意識發出的心聲吧。=That is correct. Let's start by listening to the collective unconscious of this area.
唔……？=Hm?
找到了？=Did you find it?
不，沒找到。\n不過……某種強大的氣息正在接近……！=It's not that. Something with a powerful aura is coming this way!
是敵人，大家注意！=It's an enemy! Be on your guard!
{{A}}！？這個是什麼啊……！={{A}}!? What is that!?
喂喂，\n這一看就不好惹啊……！=This thing looks crazy strong!
{{A}}，\n這一看就不好惹啊……！=This thing looks crazy strong!
這傢伙是……！=I know this guy!
該不會是那時候的！？=<size\=26>Is this the one from before!?</size>
沒錯，吾也記得，\n可是那時候明明已經打倒這傢伙了……！=Ah, I recognize this one too. \nBut I was sure we defeated it back then.
搞不懂你們在說什麼啊，\n它要來了！=I don't know what you're talkin' about, but it's attacking!

這到底是什麼東西，\n跟普通的陰影也不一樣……=What was that? It seemed different from a normal Shadow.
吾和WONDER，\n曾經同剛才的那個陰影交過手。=Wonder and I have fought that Shadow before.
那是第一次進入{{A}}時……\n這個陰影當時已經被吾等擊潰了。=The day Wonder first entered {{A}}, \nwe fought and defeated it.
啊……你是說原本被打倒了的陰影，\n又出現了？=Um... So a Shadow we thought was defeated reappeared again?
嗯，而且剛才交手時對方似乎變強了……\n看來其身上慾望的力量也有所提升。=Yes, and it was even stronger than before... like the power of its desire had grown.
這究竟是怎麼回事……\n莫非對方是能夠無限重生的陰影嗎？=What could this mean... Is this Shadow being constantly reborn here without end?
可以不斷剝奪著人們的慾望嗎……？=A Shadow of that strength, robbing people of their desires would mean...
不對……如果存在那種陰影，\n那現實世界理應早就陷入混沌之中……=No, it can't be. If that were the case, the\nworld would have already fallen into chaos.
我還是沒太懂……\n所以那算是什麼陰影啊？=I don't really get what all that means, \nbut what kind of Shadow was it?
抱歉，吾也還沒有弄清楚，\n但能肯定的是，那種存在今後要多加警惕。=Sorry, I'm not sure either. But it's something we need to be wary of going forward.
好了，不能讓那種傢伙影響工作，\n吾再重新尋找一下{{A}}的氣息吧。=Well, interruption aside, we should continue looking for signs of the {{A}}.
唔……不行，\n完全聽不到任何有關下一個{{A}}的聲音……=Hm... No good. I can't hear anything about the next {{A}}...
難不成下一個{{B}}，也是{{A}}那樣、\n是那種「躲起來偷偷做壞事」的類型 ？=Does that mean the next {{B}} is hiding their evil deeds like {{A}} did?
有這個可能，\n但也可能是個惡行尚未被曝光之人。=Perhaps. Or it could be a villain who's yet to catch the public's attention.
這類人如果沒有更多情報，\n單靠聽取心聲是很難找到的……=Such people are hard to find by listening to the voices from their Palace alone. We need more intel.
情報嗎……在{{A}}怎麼才能找得到？=How're we supposed to gather info in the {{A}}?
不是在{{A}}找=We won't
在現實世界找就行=<size\=27>We'll search the real world</size>
嗯，看來要先在現實世界中確認一下，\n有沒有出現什麼問題之類的。=Oh right, I guess we'll have to look for problems going on in the real world and go from there.
……啊！怪不得，我在當怪盜之前，\n記得你們就在打聽{{A}}的事。=Oh! Like how you guys investigated {{A}} before I became a Phantom Thief.
嗯，吾提議先回現實世界，\n經歷了剛才的戰鬥吾等也精疲力盡了。=Yes, well, I suggest we return to reality. \nI'm sure we're all exhausted from the battle.
繼續探索{{A}}也未嘗不可，\n這就交給隊長判斷了。=Of course, you may continue searching, but I'll leave that decision up to our leader.

Hit-and-run Rider Intro

有毛病啊！不想活了是吧！=Watch it, moron! Ya coulda killed me!
呸……什麼人啊，想幹嘛呀！=Damn... What's that guy's problem!?
剛才那個，在{{A}}看到過哦，\n是{{B}}啊，{{B}}。=He was featured on {{A}}.\nHe's a {{B}}.
我記得是叫「{{A}}」之類的。=I think he's called the "{{A}},"\nor something like that.
{{A}}？\n什麼玩意啊，真會給人添亂。={{A}}? Ugh, what a pain.
{{B}}，怎麼到處都是{{A}}，\n這日子活的也太難了啊……=Agh, it's hard livin' in a world with so many {{A}}s.

Chapter 3 Velvet Room 1
----------
{{A}}……抱歉今晚也讓你過來，\n首先要給予你稱讚。={{A}}... I am grateful for your presence tonight. Now first, a word of praise.
繼「{{B}}」後，又壓制「{{C}}」的{{A}}，\n你的慾望再次贏得了勝利。=The strength of your desire has outdone the {{A}}s of {{B}} and {{C}}.
請允許我為您鼓掌。=It may be presumptuous of me, \nbut please accept this round of applause.
慾望強烈到足以引導當下的世界……=You, with desire powerful enough to guide such a world away from ruin...
只有他們被賦予的力量……　\n看來已經用得很熟練了。=It seems you are using the power bestowed upon you effectively.
被賦予的力量？=What power?
你是說{{A}}？=You mean {{A}}?
{{B}}所指的是，\n您正在使用的潛入{{A}}的力量。=My master refers to the power you use to infiltrate other worlds.
嗯，賦予你的力量……就是{{A}}。=Yes, the power granted to you... That of the Metaverse Navigator.
根據使用者的意志，它既可以是鑰匙，\n用來躲過即將到來的{{A}}……=It may become the key to averting the coming catastrophe.
抑或是，可能帶來{{A}}的元兇。=Or it may be the source that brings destruction forth.
鑰匙？=The key to salvation?
元兇？=The source of ruin?
{{A}}，擁有這份力量之人……={{A}}, in other words...
「並不只有你們而已」……\n就是這樣。=You are not the only possessors of this power.
除了我們還有其他人？=There are others?
究竟是誰？=Who do you mean?
{{A}}……我們不過是你旅途中的守望者，\n所以，無法為你指明答案。=Alas, we are merely observers of your journey. \nTherefore, we cannot give you the answers.
歸根結底，\n結局需要由你自己去選擇。=Ultimately, the outcome must be chosen by you and you alone.
當你徹底解開謎團，\n你的慾望也會更進一步吧……=Surely the action you take to uncover the truth will bring your desire to new heights.
今晚就先到這裡。=That is all for this evening.
做個好夢……\n期待再次與你相見。=Sweet dreams... \nI look forward to our next meeting.

Chapter 3 Part 1 Day 2
----------
啊，你是……{{A}}的朋友吧！=Oh, you...! You're {{A}}'s friend!
{{A}}，我打算恢復營業，\n正要把這歇業的通知給撕下來呢。=I'm thinkin' a startin' up shop again. \nJust takin' down the closed notice.
您身體沒事了嗎？=Is your health okay?
{{A}}，謝謝。={{A}}, thanks.
身體好多了，雖然還沒有完全恢復……=Well, I can't say I'm back to a hundred percent yet.
但是最近啊，在床上躺著的時候，\n腦子裡常常會浮現出客人們的表情呢。=But lately, even when I lie down to rest,\nall I can think about is my customers.
我應該是太想看到他們吃了我的拉麵以後，\n那個滿足開心的表情了吧。=I just can't wait to see the smiles on their faces when they eat my ramen.
{{B}}身上能感受到充盈的{{C}}望,\n這應該是吾等將{{A}}後的影響所致……=I can sense {{B}} overflowing with hope. Of course this is a result of us changing Miyazawa's heart...
但想必，\n也跟{{A}}新區域的開放有所關聯。=But unlocking the new area of {{A}} may have also had an effect.
我於是就想，既然都躺不住了，\n那能做的就是爬起來開店了吧？=So, if I can't sleep peacefully, I've just gotta open the shop back up, right?
{{A}}，不過兼職的人也都走了，\n我這店營業起來也不太穩定吧……=Well, all my part-timers quit, so I'll still be out of operation for a while, but...
啊！你是住在這附近嗎？\n要不要來我這打工啊？=Wait! You live around here, right?\nWant a job?
想來=I'd love one
喔，真的啊？那可太感謝了！=Oh, really?\nThanks, kid!
要打工的話，隨時來店裡找我就好。=Well, come by again when ya feel like workin'.
嗯，當然不是讓你立刻就決定，\n感興趣的話和我說一聲吧。=Sure. Ya don't gotta decide right away.\nJust think about it if you're interested.
如果想來打工，\n隨時都可以來店裡找我。=Come by whenever ya feel like workin' part-time.
啊，再聊下去你上學就要遲到了。=Ah boy, I'm gonna make ya late for school.
今天可能還會下雨呢，\n得趕緊著點了，我這邊就不耽誤了。=Looks like it might rain, so ya oughta hurry. See ya when I see ya.
這天色，看來是要下一場雨了……\n你帶傘了嗎？=It does look like rain...\nDo you have an umbrella?
沒帶=No, I don't
也沒時間回去拿了……=<size\=26>There's no time to get one...</size>
唔，好吧……\n不過也沒時間回去拿了。=Hm, I see. We don't have time to go back for one either, do we?
只好祈禱在下雨之前走到學校了。=I suppose we'll just have to head to school and hope we arrive before the rain starts.
是啊，那就放棄回去拿傘吧。=No umbrella for us then.
去學校吧……=I should get to school...

下雨了呢=Rain, huh...
偏偏這時候沒帶傘呢=It always rains the one time I don't bring an umbrella.

謝謝{{A}}，幸虧遇見你了啊～！=Thank you, {{A}}.\nYou're a lifesaver!
我只是正好路過。=I just happened to be passing by.
坐車上學嗎？=<size\=28>You have your own driver?</size>
有錢人啊……=You sure are rich...
我平時也是乘電車上學的，\n今天因為要處理一些著急的資料才破例。=I usually take the train, but today I had to finish working on some documents before school.
資料……？啊，確實，\n高峰期的電車裡可沒辦法做事～=Documents? I guess that would be hard on the train with the morning rush and all.
……嗯，剩下的等到校再做也來得及了。=Yes. But I think I can finish the rest once we arrive.
我們應該見過幾次了，\n但還是第一次這樣和你說話呢。=I've seen you at school, but this is the first time we've really spoken.
你跟{{A}}是同班嗎？=You're in the same class as {{A}}, \naren't you?
啊，對，我們是一個班的……=Ah, yes, that's right.
我的名字不值一提……=<size\=25>My name's not worth knowing</size>
r:"^(.*)同學，(.*)。\n我是(.*)。$"="It's nice to meet you, $1-kun.\nMy name is $3."
{{A}}，怎麼客套起來了！？=Uh, what!?
r:"^哎呀……\n他是(.*)同學啦，(.*)。$"="Ummm... His name is $1-kun, \n$2."
{{C}}，真是個有趣的人，\n{{B}}，我是{{A}}。={{C}}, how interesting. It's nice to meet you. My name is {{A}}.
……快要到學校了，\n你們檢查一下，別把東西落在車上了。=We're about to arrive. Check to make sure you don't forget anything in the car.
下次見。=Goodbye then.
謝謝啦，{{A}}！=Thank you so much, {{A}}!
早上能遇到{{A}}，真是太走運了。=Lucky {{A}} picked us up!
唔，本來做好當落湯雞的準備了……\n沒想到還能如此從容的抵達。=Quite. We expected to get drenched, but had a comfortable little journey instead.
車裡也很寬敞，\n論舒適度可謂與吾的車不相上下哇。=And the vehicle itself was no less spacious nor less comfortable than my car form.
{{B}}，比起{{A}}的車，\n{{C}}家的車座感覺更高級吧～？={{B}}, I think {{C}}'s car seats got yours beat in the luxury department, {{A}}.
豈有此理！？=Excuse me!?
{{A}}可是大小姐，\n是{{B}}的社長{{C}}哦。={{A}} is super rich. She's the daughter of {{B}}'s president.
對，是賣梅乾這類醃製品的企業。\n還拍了電視廣告呢……你們沒看到過嗎？=Yeah, the company that sells umeboshi and pickled goods. Their ads are on TV all the time. You guys haven't heard of it?
還有梅子汁啊，梅子糖啊……\n反正他們家的商品種類特別多。=They sell tons of plum products like juice and candy too.
我以前每次訓練完，\n就總是喝{{A}}家的梅子汁呢～={{A}} always gave us that juice to drink after practice～
訓練？=Practice?
你們以前就認識？=<size\=21>You've known each other that long?</size>
是啊，以前還在少年棒球隊的時候。=Yeah, little league practice.
那時候訓練用的地方，\n還是借用{{A}}名下的場地呢。=The baseball field we used to practice on belongs to {{A}}.
嗯，你還記得，\n我以前打過少年棒球嗎？=Yeah. You know how I used to play in little league?
那時候用的練習場，\n就是借用{{A}}名下的場地哦。=The field we used to practice on was {{A}}'s.
{{A}}她呀，因為年齡和我差不多，\n那時候常來給我加油，我們關係就好起來啦。={{A}} and I are close in age, so she used to come cheer us on at games and we became friends.
不過……\n我也好久沒跟{{A}}放鬆地聊聊天了。=But it's been a long time since we've really had a chance to talk.
升入高中以後，\n{{B}}總是在忙{{A}}的工作……=Since starting high school, she's been busy with disciplinary committee duties.
{{A}}？怎麼感覺大家都往一個方向……={{A}}? What's everyone gathering for?
……{{A}}，啊～！今天全校要開晨會吧？=Oh crap! Isn't there a school-wide assembly this morning?
吾記得，\n昨天班主任{{A}}應該提到過……=I remember your homeroom teacher saying something to that effect yesterday.
完了！\n進體育館遲到的話所有人都看得見啊！=Crap! We're gonna stick out like sore thumbs if we get to the gym late!
來不及回教室了！\n我們直接去體育館！=We don't have time to stop by the classroom! Let's head straight to the gym!
全校晨會是在體育館哦，\n快點快點！=The assembly's in the gym.\nCome on, we gotta hurry!

Meet Akashi

接下來，有請到任我校的新{{B}}上臺發言。\n{{A}}，拜託您了。=Next, please welcome the newest member of our school's teaching staff, {{A}}.
各位同學，初次見面！\n我是「臨時教育顧問」，{{A}}。=Hello, everyone! My name is {{A}}. I will be acting as an educational advisor in a temporary capacity.
聽起來，這個職位應該有些令人費解吧，\n簡而言之呢……=I know this title may be a little difficult for you to understand...
我是抱著讓{{A}}變得更好這一目的來到這裡，\n所謂教育顧問，就是這樣的工作。=But essentially, I am an educational consultant brought here to improve {{A}}.
……教育顧問？=...Educational consultant?
那是什麼～=The heck kinda job is that?
在校內調查極待改進的事項，回饋理事會，\n並提出改善請求，各位同學可以這樣理解。=My job is to look for ways to improve this school and work with the school board to make those changes happen.
由於各位{{A}}目前工作繁忙，\n所以我才被派來負責專職調查。=Your other teachers are so busy with their own responsibilities that I was brought in to work full-time on this effort.
今後，大家可能會常在校內各處見到我，\n或者在課堂上看到我出現……=So from tomorrow onward, you may see me around the school, observing classes and such...
但請大家放心，我絕對不是可疑人物，\n還請不要提防哦<sprite\=1 tint\=1>=But don't be alarmed. \nI promise it's all on the up and up!
……啊，不好不好，\n這麼一說……反倒讓人覺得可疑了？{{A}}。=Then again, I suppose putting it that way makes me seem more suspicious! {{A}}!
無精打采的女學生=Listless Female Student
開心的女學生=Happy Female Student
有些輕浮的男學生=Frivolous Male Student
{{A}}，這個{{B}}還蠻奇怪的～={{A}}, what a weirdo.
感覺他挺好說話的，而且還挺帥……=He seems easy to talk to.\nPlus he's kinda hot.
那能不能把自動販賣機的飲料，\n都設置成免費的啊，{{A}}！=Make the vending machines free, {{A}}!
嗯嗯，不錯的建議！但能不能免費，\n取決於和理事會溝通的結果哦……=Great idea! That being said, I'll have to negotiate with the school board first.
大家的意見對我來說都很寶貴！\n請各位不要拘謹、隨時和我溝通哦！=But I'm open to all of your opinions! \nPlease feel free to get in touch with me!
太假了吧……\n最後肯定什麼都不會變吧。=Pfff, yeah sure. \nLike anything will actually change anyway.
{{A}}～這樣就挺好了嘛，\n午休的時候一起去找他聊天吧～=Whoa, for real?\nLet's go talk to him during lunch.
{{A}}上次跟我說的，\n就是指{{B}}吧。=I guess {{B}} must be the teacher {{A}} was talking about.
教育顧問……雖然還是沒聽明白，\n不過感覺是個有趣的{{A}}呢。=I don't really get what an consultant does, but he seems like an interesting guy.
唔，如果這樣能喚起學生們的慾望，\n倒不失為一樁美事。=Well, if it stirs up hope in the students,\nthen all the better.
謝謝{{A}}的發言，\n那麼，今天的晨會就到此結束。=Thank you very much, {{A}}.\nThat concludes the morning assembly.

{{B}}，給你介紹一下，\n這位是{{C}}，{{A}}。={{B}}, let me introduce you to the {{C}}, {{A}}.
{{B}}，{{A}}。={{B}}, {{A}}.
{{A}}……\n啊，是{{B}}的社長{{C}}吧。={{A}}... Ah yes, heiress to the {{B}} company.
這跟您剛才戴的眼鏡不一樣呢，\n是……智能眼鏡嗎？=Those are different from the glasses you were wearing before. Are those smart glasses?
啊，失禮了。=Ah, yes.
這次就任前，對於擔任校內骨幹的學生資料，\n我一併存入眼鏡裡了，畢竟這也是我的工作。=My apologies. I uploaded all of the students' information into these in preparation for the job.
{{A}}兼社長{{B}}，\n成績優秀，在學校裡也頗受歡迎。=You are the {{A}}, daughter of a CEO, have excellent grades, and are very popular among your peers
……見笑了。=I'm nothing special...
哎呀～不愧是{{A}}，\n連事前調查都做的如此完美！=Wow. That's {{A}} for you.\nHis prep work is second to none!
你說的對，{{A}}真的非常優秀，\n一定能幫{{B}}分憂的。=I agree that {{A}} is quite the talent. \nShe'll surely be a great help to you.
像校內介紹和必要的資料什麼的，\n不必客氣，儘管吩咐{{A}}就好！=Feel free to get her to give you directions around the school or prepare any materials you may need!
……主任，對學生用「吩咐」這個詞，\n是不是不太合規呢？=Sir... Isn't it a violation of compliance to order students around?
哎呀……！你看我這嘴，\n這、你就當沒聽見吧，{{A}}……=Oh! Um... You didn't hear that... {{A}}.
啊對了，{{A}}你拜託我的辦公室，\n用這間{{B}}就可以了。=As for the private room you requested, \nplease use the {{B}}.
多謝，雖然教師辦公室那邊，\n您給我早就安排好了工位……=Thank you very much. I know you've also prepared me a desk in the Faculty Room, but...
但考慮到顧問工作的特殊性，個別資料，\n不方便當著其他{{A}}面處理，感謝您的理解。=Some of the documents I'll be working with aren't meant to be seen by other teachers, so that will be a big help.
應該的應該的，這個房間請隨意使用吧！\n啊，{{A}}……資料給{{B}}。=Of course. Please use the space freely!\n{{A}}, the documents?
好的。=Yes.
{{A}}，這是你之前說想要的資料，\n還請確認一下。={{A}}, these are the materials you requested in advance. Please have a look.
哦哦……！=Oho!
我還準備了電子版的資料，\n會一併發送到{{A}}的電腦上。=I've also prepared them in digital form, \nso I'll send the files to your computer.
好的，太感謝了！\n細節部分我會用電子版確認的。=Thank you very much! I'll be sure to use that data to get the specifics I need.
哎呀，不過這可真是……\n要準備這麼多資料，應該費了不少功夫吧。=But wow, it must have been quite the task to prepare all of this.
{{B}}，我不是說過了嘛？\n{{A}}可是很優秀的！={{B}}, I told you, didn't I?\n{{A}} does outstanding work!
關於這個，{{A}}……=But, sir...
雖然這話我說不合適，畢竟是我拜託製作的，\n但這麼多工作真的能夠交給學生獨自承擔嗎？=I know I'm the one who requested the documents, but this workload hardly seems reasonable for a single student.
另外，從保密的角度來看，\n這些資料交給學生處理也略有不妥。=Having students handle such sensitive documents is also an issue.
啊，這個事啊，{{C}}……怎麼說呢，\n{{B}}，{{A}}在這方面……非常優秀！=Ah— Uh— {{C}}...\nWell, she excels at keeping secrets too!
與其他同學不同，她對我提出的要求，\n都考慮得很周全，做的很不錯……=Unlike the other students, she understands what needs to be done and acts accordingly.
這樣呀？但也不能讓人家太辛苦了哦？=Is that right? You really shouldn't push her too hard, you know.
這樣呀？但也不能讓人家太辛苦了哦！=Is that right? You really shouldn't push her too hard, you know.
那肯定！這個，{{A}}啊，\n她將來有繼承家業的打算……=Wouldn't dream of it! But she will have to inherit her family's business someday...
這類事務性的工作對她來說，\n可以看作是鍛煉嘛，對吧，{{A}}！？=...and this kind of clerical work will prepare her for that. Isn't that right, {{A}}!?
……是的，\n父親也鼓勵我多協助{{A}}們的工作。=...Yes. My father has encouraged me to help the teachers with whatever they need.
原來如此……\n看來是真的很「優秀」啊。=I see...\nOutstanding indeed...
今後那就在放學時間辛苦你幫忙了，\n拜託你了，{{A}}。=In that case, I may ask for your help after school on occasion, so I look forward to working with you, {{A}}.
好的，{{B}}，{{A}}。=Of course, {{A}}.

……需要大家注意的就是這些，\n啊，還有一件事……=That's all the announcements for today.\nOh, one more thing.
雖然今天的晨會上已經說明過了，\n是關於……那位{{A}}。=Regarding {{A}} from the assembly this morning...
他提到「今後會常在校內見到他」，\n「請大家不要拘謹隨時溝通」之類的話……=I know he mentioned he'll be around campus starting tomorrow, and encouraged you all to come speak with him, but...
{{A}}……大家適當注意分寸和禮貌就好，\n那……我這邊也算是說過了。=Well... Just be careful not to be rude to him, okay? That's all.
你不覺得……\n{{A}}，今天有點不對勁嗎？=Does it seem like {{A}} is acting strange?
唔，吾從她剛才的話裡能察覺到，\n她對那個叫{{A}}的有什麼意見。=Well, it certainly sounds like she has a bit of disdain for this {{A}} fellow.
但那個{{A}}才剛來吧？\n唔，是不是發生過什麼事啊……=But he only just got here. \nYou think something happened between them?
還有，就是顧問什麼的，\n到底是幹嘛的呀？=Also, what exactly does a consultant even do?
教育改革？=Educational reform?
改善環境？=<size\=22>Improving the school environment?</size>
要是增加考試什麼的絕對不要啊～\n不過減少一定大受歡迎。=I'd hate to have more tests.\nBut I'd definitely welcome less!
他在晨會上，應該說的是……\n要創造出更有利於大家學習環境之類的話。=He did say something about making learning easier at the assembly.
啊～對，\n還有個男生說想要販賣機變免費呢。=Oh, and some boys asked for free vending machines too.
啊～他在晨會上是說過類似的話，\n還有個男生說想要販賣機免費用呢。=Oh yeah, I heard those boys at the assembly asking for free vending machines.
{{A}}～～你不在意嗎？　\n他在晨會上可是說了歡迎大家提要求呢……=Oh, you don't? He said this morning that he's open to requests from students...
啊，能不能拜託他把食堂的菜單……\n做得更豪華一些啊？=Maybe we can ask for a fancier cafeteria menu?
還有還有，想要增加小賣部的麵包種類！\n比如甜的麵包再多一些就好啦～=Oh! And they should sell more baked goods!\nI'd looove some sweet pastries～
雖說有慾望是好事，\n但{{A}}未免也太偏向於食慾了吧……=There's nothing wrong with having desires,\nbut an overactive appetite is another issue...

Lighter Girls

喲，要去吃午飯？=Hey! Headin' to lunch?
我早上在便利商店發現好幾種稀有口味的泡麵，要不要一起去{{A}}吃？=I found some interesting cup noodles at the convenience store this mornin'. Wanna go to the hideout and try 'em?
超級增量蒜香味……？=Extreme Garlic...?
辛辣哈瓦那辣椒味……？=<size\=30>Super Spicy Habanero...?</size>
刺不刺激？\n不管什麼口味都要嘗下才對嘛！=They're really goin' all out on the flavors, don't ya think? Gotta try everythin' at least once, right!?
雖然有點不安……\n但也很想吃吃看……=I'm kind of nervous, but I think I want to try them...
好！我們再買點飲料就去天臺。=All right! Let's grab some drinks and head to the roof.
接下來～\n我們挑戰的是～「不試試怎麼知道」系列～！=Hey guys～!\nWe're here with a taste testing video～!
在學校的自動販賣機上～\n試著買走全部種類的飲料～！耶～！=We're gonna buy every drink our school vending machine sells and try all of them～! Yaaay～!
她們在幹嘛？\n堵在販賣機那兒……很影響別人使用啊。=What the hell?\nThey're blocking the vending machine.
她們在幹嘛？\n堵在販賣機那裡……很影響別人使用啊。=What the hell?\nThey're blocking the vending machine.
她們從剛才起就一直在那拍影片……=Those two have been recording themselves over there for a while now...
難道她們不覺得給人添麻煩了嗎？\n誰去叫一下{{A}}啊……=Can't they tell they're in the way?\nSomebody should get a teacher.
我說啊，這個系列錢是花了不少，\n但感覺沒有什麼衝擊力啊？=Hey, don't you think this idea's kind of boring considering the cost?
{{A}}～～都開始拍了你才說這些～\n那我們還能拍什麼啊？=Ugh, don't say that after we've started recording. \nWhat's your idea then?
那個怎麼樣～昨天{{A}}上更新的，\n就{{B}}幹的那個～=I got it～ Let's do what that {{B}} on {{A}} yesterday did～
你要學{{A}}嗎？\n{{B}}，好厲害！你就是{{A}}吧～！=You wanna imitate a {{A}}? {{B}}, that's wild! Are you a {{A}} too!?
用這個噴霧～還有打火機～\n表演個噴射火焰吧！！=I'll use this spray and a lighter to make a flamethrower!
這兩個人腦子有問題嗎！\n得阻止她們才行！=They're outta their minds!\nI gotta stop them!
你們在幹什麼！！=What do you think you're doing!?
好疼！=Ow!
喂，好疼啊！你幹嘛呀！=What's wrong with you!?\nThat frickin' hurt!
這個問題該我問你才對，\n你們知道自己剛才在做什麼嗎？=You took the words right out of my mouth. Do you have any idea how much danger you almost put yourselves in just now?
啊～？\n我們只是拍影片啊～？=Excuse me? We were just shooting a video.
剛我可都拍下來了哦，\n{{A}}打人的畫面！=And I got you on camera hitting a student!
把{{B}}的影片發給{{A}}吧！\n說不定會爆火啊！=Let's post about this {{B}} on {{A}}! I bet it'll go viral!
把暴力{{B}}的影片發給{{A}}吧！\n說不定會爆火啊！=Let's post about this Violent Teacher on {{A}}! I bet it'll go viral!
喂，你們夠了啊！\n{{A}}只是在制止你們愚蠢的行為而已！=Hey, that's enough! {{A}} was just trying to stop you dumbasses from setting yourselves on fire!
好疼啊！你幹什麼啊！你、你誰啊？=Owww! What're you doing!?\nWho even are you?
{{A}}又來了個暴力男生？\n你別碰女孩子啊～=A violent boy?\nHow dare you lay hands on a girl!?
啊？你拍什麼拍啊！=What? Hey! Turn that camera off!
{{A}}冷靜一下，先放開她。={{A}}, calm down.\nLet go of her hand.
……唔，對不起……=Oh, sorry...
還有你們，別再拍了。=Stop recording at once, you two.
{{A}}，喂！開什麼玩笑啊，還我啊！=Ah, hey! What the hell!? Give that back!
你的手機也交出來。=Hand over your phone too.
啊～？你是因為自己被拍了，\n所以想掩蓋事實吧～？你這就是{{A}}嘛！=Hah? Are you covering this up because we caught you on camera? You really are a {{A}}!
蠻橫教師！蠻橫教師！=Violent Teacher! Violent Teacher over here!
……唔，你們適可而止……！=That's enough alre—!
安靜點！！=Quiet!!
聽說這裡有同學鬧得太過了，\n所以我過來看看。=I heard some students were causing trouble.
這究竟是什麼情況？=What exactly is going on here?
{{A}}對我們使用暴力呢～！={{A}} assaulted me!
她還沒收了我們的手機！=I got it all on video!
胡說八道！\n是因為你們先掏出打火機的……！=That's not what happened! You two started it when you whipped out a lighter!
哎呀～你怎麼凶人啊～！=Eep! Don't yell at me!
……好了，請把事情經過說明一下。=Please, just tell me what happened.
師生之間的爭吵……嗎。\n身為顧問，我也想聽聽到底怎麼回事。=A dispute between a teacher and student? As a consultant, I'd like to hear what's going on.
{{B}}請向我說明一下吧，我會負責。\n學生那邊，就交給{{A}}了。=I will speak to {{B}}.\nYou speak to the students, {{A}}.
等一下，這兩個學生，\n她們剛才是想幹危險的事啊？=Hold on. These students were engaged in incredibly dangerous behavior.
不能就這樣放任不管，如果要帶走我，\n那就讓其他{{A}}來處理。=We can't just leave them be. If you're going to pull me aside, at least call for another teacher to deal with them.
不不，這裡就交給{{A}}吧，\n畢竟學生的事由學生解決是最好的。=No, the {{A}} can handle it. \nStudents should take care of other students.
你在說什麼！\n指導學生……這是{{A}}的工作！=Don't be ridiculous!\nIt's the teacher's job to guide the students!
我並沒有亂說哦？\n改變這種陳舊的想法正是我的工作。=I'm not being ridiculous. It's my job to uproot old ways of thinking like that.
我並沒有亂說哦！\n改變這種陳舊的想法正是我的工作。=I'm not being ridiculous. It's my job to uproot old ways of thinking like that.
……您不必擔心，{{A}}，\n就由我來聽取學生這邊的情況吧。=Don't worry, {{A}}. I'll be here to listen to what the students have to say.
而且，這也是我作為{{A}}的職責。=It's one of my jobs as a {{A}}.
手機還給學生吧，當下的社會環境，\n沒收私人物品是會引發問題的哦？=Return this to them. Confiscating personal effects is a big problem in today's climate.
手機還給學生吧，當下的社會環境，\n沒收私人物品是會引發問題的哦！=Return this to them. Confiscating personal effects is a big problem in today's climate.
影片裡還拍到了其他學生！\n不刪掉的話不能還給她們！=They were recording other students! I can't return it until the videos are deleted!
說什麼啊你！？\n刪影片的話我可饒不了你！？=What!? No way you're deleting our videos! Screw that!
……她們可能會宣稱是{{A}}刪除了證據，\n掩蓋了事實哦。=If a teacher were to delete a video, \nthere would be allegations of a cover-up.
這裡就由我這個局外人來確認吧，\n如果有問題就刪掉，這樣可以嗎？=How about I, as a third party, check it? If there truly is a problem, then I'll delete it.
{{B}}～！？\n連{{A}}都這麼說，真是過分阿～！=Huh!? How could you, {{A}}～!
我不會看其他影片的，而且如今這個環境，\n我也不推薦利用有爭議的影片賺播放率呢。=I'll only watch the one video. Also, I don't recommend using controversy to go viral in this day and age.
有空的話，\n我很樂意教你們些更好的影片製作方法呢。=When I have more time,\nI'll teach you how to make better videos.
{{B}}？{{A}}，你也會做影片啊～？=Seriously? You know how to make videos?
嗯，我好歹也算個顧問，\n對什麼樣的影片能受歡迎還是很了解的。=Yes. I'm a consultant. I know exactly what kinds of videos will boost your numbers.
哇，這才是成熟從容的成年人嘛～！=Whoa, Akashi-sensei's so chill!
聊的差不多了吧？\n你們兩位，跟我去{{A}}吧。=Is that all then? You two, please follow me to the {{A}}.
{{A}}，待會{{B}}大人也會叫我過去吧……=Does that mean that I'm gonna have to talk to Disciplinary Committee-sama too?
你回去吧，我會跟{{A}}打聲招呼的，\n再不吃中飯，午休就要結束了哦。=Alright. I'll talk to {{A}} for you. \nEat your lunch before the break ends.
那，{{A}}就跟我來吧。=Okay, {{A}}. \nWith me, please.
……好的。=All right...
{{A}}！\n{{B}}你沒做錯……我們都看到了！={{A}}! It wasn't your fault...\nWe saw everything!

喲，午休時候的事……\n{{A}}沒有做錯，你覺得呢？=Hey, you don't think {{A}}'s in the wrong, do you?
我覺得沒做錯=She's in the right
暴力是不對的=Violence solves nothing
對吧？要是不管那兩個人，\n肯定有人會被燒傷的。=Right? Someone could've been seriously burned if she hadn't gotten involved.
就算{{A}}沒來，\n我也會打掉那個人手裡的打火機。=And if she hadn't smacked the lighter outta that girl's hand, you better believe I woulda.
道理是這樣……\n可能就不應該打她的手吧……=That's true... Maybe she coulda handled it better than she did...
可要是沒人管的話，\n早就有人受傷了啊？=But somebody could've been seriously burned if she hadn't gotten involved.
就算{{A}}沒來，\n我也會打掉那人手裡的打火機。=And if she hadn't smacked the lighter outta that girl's hand, you better believe I woulda.
雖然你說的在理……但如果那時候，\n當場打女生手的人是你的話，問題就更大了。=I understand your point, but it would have been an even bigger problem if you had attacked another student.
不是，怎麼就……！=It wouldn't have come to that...!
……唔，這麼說……\n{{A}}又救了我一次。=I guess {{A}} saved my ass once again.

Chapter 3 Part 1 Day 3

這個肯定是{{A}}吧？=That's definitely {{A}}, right?
昨天好像有女生被打了？=I heard she hit some girl yesterday.
r:"^(.*)，快看這個！$"="$1, look at this!"
好像是{{A}}的網站……=It's the website for {{A}}...
{{B}}她……\n被人當成{{A}}發到網上去了！={{B}} was posted as a {{A}}!
你看，這個影片！=Look at this video!
這是，昨天午休時候的……？\n似乎是經過編輯後的片段。=Is this from yesterday's lunch break? \nIt looks quite heavily edited.
雖然臉上打了馬賽克，\n名字也化名成了「K{{A}}」……=They blurred her face and wrote her name as K-{{A}}...
但只要是我們學校的學生，\n一看就知道這是{{A}}啊。=But any of the students here would immediately know that it's {{A}}.
到底是誰上傳了影片呢……=Who would've posted something like this?

這是怎麼回事！？=What is the meaning of this!?
還偏偏是{{B}}被當成{{A}}發到了網上……\n真是前所未聞的醜聞！=A teacher, of all people, labeled a {{A}}!? This is an unprecedented scandal!
{{A}}你也是！\n不是讓學生把影片刪掉了嗎！？=And you, {{A}}! I thought you had the students delete the videos!
是的，刪當然是刪掉了，\n不過……=Yes, of course I did.\nHowever...
或許是有其他學生拍下來放到網上的，\n畢竟當時的情況比較混亂。=Other students may have been recording too. It did cause quite a stir.
哎呀，真是的！=Agh! I've had it up to here!
{{A}}，你聽好了！\n今後除上課之外，你不要再接觸學生了！=Listen up, {{A}}! No contact with students outside of class from now on!
不能跟學生接觸，不能跟學生談話，\n禁止沒收學生的私人物品！懂了嗎！？=Don't touch them! Don't talk to them! \nDon't take their things! Are we clear!?
什麼……\n你是叫我不要去管學生的危險行為嗎？=Unbelievable... So you want me to just turn a blind eye to dangerous behavior?
遇到那種事，你就找其他{{C}}或者{{B}}！\n再不然你叫{{A}}來處理好了！=Call for {{B}} or another teacher if that happens! Or get {{A}} to help!
{{A}}……雖然是{{B}}，\n但她還是個學生啊？={{A}}!? Disciplinary Committee aside, \nshe's just a student!
你的意思是要教師依賴學生嗎？=Are you suggesting teachers should rely on students to do their jobs for them?
她比你可靠譜多了！=That student is more reliable than you are!
其實，我聽說接受{{A}}訓誡的學生，\n都老老實實地寫了檢討書呢。=In fact, the female students {{A}} reprimanded both turned in formal letters of apology.
但不包括，\n那位你擅自放他離開的男學生哦？=A far cry from the boy you sent back to class without a word of warning.
但不包括，\n那位你擅自放他離開的男學生哦！=A far cry from the boy you sent back to class without a word of warning.
……唔。=Ngh...
{{B}}～總之你今天先回去吧，{{A}}。={{B}}～ At any rate, \nI want you to go home for the day.
{{A}}……我還有課，還有班會要開，\n不能留著這些工作不管……=What? But I have to teach my classes and conduct homeroom. I can't just abandon my duties.
你的課就改自習吧，\n班會的話找其他{{A}}替你就好了吧？=Your classes will be study hall periods. And another teacher can sub in for your homeroom.
反正今天的課是上不成了，\n估計你只會被學生圍住問這問那而已。=You wouldn't be able to conduct classes anyway. You'd just get bombarded with questions.
唔……我明白了，\n給您……添麻煩了……=Okay... I understand.\nSorry to have caused such trouble.
可不是嘛！=Trouble? Try total nuisance!
其他{{A}}也都注意一下！\n少管學生的閒事！=This goes for the rest of you too!\nDon't interfere with students unnecessarily!
如果有什麼需要，\n就找{{B}}或者{{A}}！明白沒有！？=If something happens, turn to {{B}} or {{A}}! Are we clear!?

{{B}}～怎麼是{{A}}啊？=Huh? What's {{A}} doing here?
{{A}}呢～？=Where's {{A}}?
啊，是我來還真是抱歉啊！\n{{A}}她……那個……啊！=Oh! Sorry to surprise everyone!\n{{A}} is um... Ummm...
{{A}}她突然身體不適！\n就先回家了，今天班會就由我代她主持……！=Sick! She wasn't feeling good and went home early! Anyway, I'll be filling in for her today!
突然就身體不適了啊，好假啊～=Sick, huh? Yeah right!
是不是因為上了{{A}}，\n所以被開除了啊～？=Did she get fired since she was on {{A}}?
沒，沒沒，她可沒被開開開除哦？\n只是讓她先回去……=She hasn't been f-f-fired!\nShe was just sent home is all...
沒，沒沒，她可沒被開開開除哦！\n只是讓她先回去……=She hasn't been f-f-fired!\nShe was just sent home is all...

{{A}}……！那個，有幾個通知！\n等我跟各位同學說明一下就放學，可以吧？=Gah! Um! It's time for announcements! I'm just gonna make them, and then we're done here, okay?
{{A}}……她還好嗎。\n{{B}}們那邊該不會出了什麼問題吧……？=I hope {{A}}'s okay. Do you think the other teachers are giving her trouble over what happened?
很擔心她=I'm worried
{{B}}她肯定很震驚吧，\n自己竟然被人拍下來發到{{A}}上了……=I still can't believe she was called out on {{A}}...
無論實際情況如何，\n既然被放上了那個網站……=Whatever the circumstances, the fact that video was posted to Divine Justice means...
那就說明你們的班主任{{B}}，\n她「成為了{{A}}」吧？=...your homeroom teacher has been declared a {{A}}.
不會不會，還不能算{{A}}，\n{{B}}只是被人投稿了一次而已！=No, no, no! She can't be declared a {{A}} from just one post!
雖然引起了討論，\n但{{A}}還沒來下官方認定啦……=Sure people are talking about it, but she hasn't been officially condemned by {{A}}...
……不過一旦出現在{{A}}上，\n大眾都會認為那個人就是{{B}}吧。=...But those reported on by {{A}} are known as {{B}}s to the public.
無論是{{A}}，還是{{B}}……\n至今為止一直都是這樣吧？=It was the same with {{A}} and {{B}}... Hasn't it always been that way?
你……{{C}}，\n跟{{A}}和{{B}}那種人才不一樣！=Hey! Don't you dare lump her in with those two!
……當然，這個影片，\n也有可能會被其他眾多話題所淹沒。=Of course there's a good chance this will get lost in the sea of other posts.
不過……如果她的名字以{{A}}的身份，\n繼續留在網上，仍舊有可能成為{{B}}……=However, if she continues to be known as a {{A}}, the possibility of her becoming a {{B}}...
有這個可能……？=...can't be ruled out
我覺得不可能=...is still nonexistent
r:"^(.*)？\n連(.*)也……這麼想嗎？$"="What? You agree with him, $2?"
就，就是！我也覺得不可能！=R-Right!? That would never happen!
如剛才所說，\n吾想說的是這種可能是存在的。=As I said before, it's only a possibility.
也許{{A}}說得沒錯……\n可{{B}}怎麼想也不可能嘛……=I know you could be right,\nbut I really don't wanna believe it.

頭好疼……好煩……=My head is killing me... I'm so pissed...
……我為什麼會成{{A}}了……！=Why am I being called a {{A}}!?
啊……為什麼，為什麼我會這麼……=Agh... Damn it all!\nWhy is this happening to me!?
這麼惱火啊……！=I'm so pissed off!

你也來買午飯嗎？=Are you here buying lunch too?
{{A}}，難得我們湊一塊，一起吃飯吧？\n可以去天臺什麼的……=Oh! Why don't we eat lunch together today? We could go to the rooftop and...
今天也一樣哦～！\n依舊是～「不試試怎麼知道」系列～！=Hey guys～! \nWelcome to another taste testing video～!
{{A}}？這是幹嘛呀？={{A}}?\nWhat's going on?
那應該是……=Huh...?
今天的目標是～拿下所有口味的麵包～！\n而且還會有評測奉上哦～！=We're gonna buy every kind of bread in the store and review them all～!
{{B}}，怎麼又是她們……\n之前就是這兩個人跟{{A}}起衝突吧……=Oh god, it's them again... They're the two that had that fight with {{A}}...
喂，你們倆幹什麼啊，\n這讓別人怎麼買東西啊！=Hey! Get outta the way! \nNobody else can buy a damn thing!
{{A}}，好可怕呀～！\n別吼人家啦～=Oh nooo, you're scaring me! \nPlease stop yelling, okaaay?
不然我會把你也拍上來發到網上哦～！\n{{A}}！=Or I'll take a video of this and throw you under the bus too! Gahaha!
這兩個人，什麼意思啊……！\n我去跟她們理論！=What's wrong with those two!? I'm gonna give them a piece of my mind!
{{A}}，冷靜點！就是她們兩個，\n害的{{C}}被傳成{{B}}的……！=Don't, {{A}}! Those two are why {{C}}'s getting the {{B}} treatment...!
啊……？那我更不能放過她們了！=Seriously...? \nAll the more reason to call them out!
誰去把{{A}}叫來啊，\n得有人能來管管他們啊。=Someone get {{A}}. \nSomething has to be done about them.
已經有人去叫嘍！=Someone's already on it!
為什麼要叫{{A}}來……？=Why {{A}}...?
不應該叫{{A}}嗎？=Why not a teacher?
你還不知道呀？最近只要有麻煩事，\n大家都是直接找{{A}}的。=You haven't heard? Recently, everyone asks for {{A}} when there's a dispute.
大家都說{{A}}那邊靠不住什麼的……=Because the teachers are unreliable...
啊，怎麼會這樣？=Huh? What do you mean?
因為就算有人惹出什麼麻煩，\n{{A}}們也不會認真去管。=Even when students are acting out, \nthe teachers won't reprimand them.
只要拿出手機，告訴{{A}}在錄影，\n{{A}}們立刻就什麼也不說了……=If someone points a phone at them and says they're recording, the teachers run off.
所以{{A}}就要代替{{B}}解決問題……？\n這太過分了……！=So what, they're having {{A}} do their jobs for them...? That's ridiculous...!
{{A}}，這邊～在這邊！=Over here, {{A}}! Over here!
怎麼又是你們……\n上次的檢討是白寫了嗎？=You two again... Was that written apology you submitted nothing but lies?
我們又沒有做什麼壞事～\n只是來小賣部買東西而已啊～=We didn't do anything～ \nWe're just here to buy lunch～
這不是已經影響到其他人了嗎？\n你們兩個過來一下。=You're inconveniencing the other students.\nCome over here for a moment.
{{A}}～就不能等我們拍完影片再說啊～？=Huh? Can't it wait until after we're done recording～?
你們不可以為難{{A}}哦。=You two shouldn't cause {{A}} any more trouble.
哎呀，是{{A}}～\n{{B}}你也來買午飯嗎～？=Oh, hey, {{A}}～ \nAre you here to buy lunch too～?
我是來勸阻你們的，\n上次不是說過這種炒作話題的影片過時了嗎？=I came here to stop you. I warned you about sharing inflammatory videos, didn't I?
才不是那一類啦～我們在做美食測評呀～=What's so inflammatory about food reviews?
這樣吧，看來我有必要再教一次，\n關於如何讓影片爆火的秘訣……=All right, all right. I suppose I'll just have to give you another lecture on viral videos, then.
真的呀～？\n那我們一起去{{A}}吃午飯吧，{{B}}～！=For real～? I guess we'll be having lunch with you in the {{A}}, Akashi-sensei～!
後面就交給我來處理吧，\n你快午休吧。=I'll deal with these two, \nso please take a break.
唔，謝謝……=Sorry to burden you...
別客氣，改善同學們的校園生活環境，\n這本就是我該做的。=It's not a burden at all. It's my job to make school life better for all of the students.
喔～一下就解決問題了，\n{{A}}原來這麼可靠啊。=Wow, {{A}} handled that really well.\nGuess he's pretty reliable, huh?
{{A}}，你沒事吧？=Are you all right, {{A}}?
r:"^啊，是(.*)和(.*)啊，\n還有……(.*)同學。$"="Oh, $1, $2. \nAnd $3-kun too."
你們的午飯時間也被耽誤了吧？\n真是不走運啊。=Did they interrupt your shopping as well? \nI'm sorry for the trouble.
我們倒是無所謂啦……=Don't worry about us...
{{A}}，難道現在是一有問題，\n就讓你出馬，真是這樣嗎？=But, {{A}}, is it true that you're being called in to settle arguments?
嗯……最近的確，\n來找{{A}}的人還挺多的。=Well... It's true that the committee has been called upon a lot more lately.
你在這裡啊，{{A}}！=There you are, {{A}}!
聽說又有學生鬧事？\n是{{A}}來解決的嗎？=Was there another problem with students? I heard that {{A}} took care of it for you.
當然也辛苦{{A}}，\n不過……=I appreciate you following up as well.\nHowever...
要是能不麻煩{{A}}出面，\n我們對你的評價也一定會更高的。=If you could avoid burdening him with your responsibilities, we in the faculty would probably have a higher opinion of you.
……評價？=...Excuse me!?
可是，這種問題……為什麼要算在{{A}}頭上，\n解決問題的人應該是{{B}}才對吧。=Instead of Riko-senpai, shouldn't the faculty be dealing with these problems in the first place?
啊……這，這個嘛。=Oh... Uh, about that...
啊，這是{{A}}訂下的方針哦。\n學生問題學生解決……這是工作方式改革啦。=It's a work reform from {{A}}. The idea is that students should manage other students.
培養學生的自主性，將{{A}}從雜務中解放，\n從而專注於教育本身……=It fosters student autonomy and frees up instructors to focus on teaching...
……那是什麼意思，\n聽起來就是逃避問題的藉口吧……！=The heck!? Sounds more like an excuse to avoid responsibility!
{{A}}，別說了。=Stop, {{A}}.
嗯，{{A}}，\n您找我是有什麼事嗎？={{A}}, was there something you needed my help with?
啊，嗯，是的，\n想讓你幫忙把資料再整理成電子版。=Oh, yes, yes there is. I'd like you to digitize some more materials for me.
我已經把{{A}}的郵件轉發給你了，\n詳細要求你就看郵件吧，我先忙去了。=I forwarded you the email from {{A}}. The details are in there.
{{B}}，什麼啊！？\n他是把自己的事推給{{A}}做了吧！？=What the—!? Did I seriously just see that man pawn off his work onto you!?
我們去理論=Let's make a complaint
……沒關係，只要做好這些工作，\n{{A}}也會給到我應有的評價。=It's fine. If I just keep my head down and do my job, the {{A}} will have a higher opinion of me.
他只是個膚淺又容易被操縱的人。\n只會考慮明哲保身，如何讓自己輕鬆……=He's simple and easy to deal with. He'll do anything to make life easier for himself.
只要這類人將我視為可以利用的棋子，\n他們就不會突然背叛我。=If you make someone like him think you're a useful pawn, he won't turn on you.
背、背叛……=Turn on you...?
在這個前提下，{{A}}還算是能信得過，\n但他有點可疑，我還沒摸透他的真實想法……=In that respect, maybe we can trust {{A}} too. Even though he's shadier than those glasses and just as hard to read.
但他應該是個只要不傷及自身利益、\n就不會輕易與他人斷絕合作關係的類型。=He's not the type to abandon someone unless they're getting in his way.
啊、等等，{{A}}你在說什麼啊，\n又是背叛又是斷絕關係的……=What are you talking about, {{A}}?\nAbandonment, betrayal...
不會有人那樣對待{{A}}的！=No one would do something like that to you, {{A}}!
愛情，友情，僅靠這種情感所維持的關係，\n不覺得令人害怕嗎？=Don't you feel uneasy when relationships are based solely on feelings or friendship?
不考慮利害關係就來套近乎的人，\n我是無法去信任的。=Personally, I don't trust people who try to get close to me without knowing what they stand to gain from it.
那、這麼說……可是……=Really? But...
就算什麼好處都沒，我也最喜歡{{A}}！=I like you, {{A}}! \nEven if there's nothing in it for me!
嗯！我也是，{{A}}！=Yeah! Me too, {{A}}!
還有，剛才{{A}}推給你的工作，\n我也來幫忙！=I know! I can help with the work the {{A}} gave you!
我就是純粹想幫{{A}}！\n才不要什麼回報！=And just because I want to help you! \nI don't want anything in return!
{{A}}和{{B}}……一直沒變呢。={{A}}, {{B}}... \nYou two never change, huh?
謝謝你們，不過我不需要幫忙，\n自己的工作量我還是心裡有數的。=Thank you, but I don't need any help. \nI can manage on my own.
你們不是來買午飯的嗎？\n再不快去就吃不上了哦。=You came to buy lunch, didn't you? \nHurry up before they run out.
總覺得，{{A}}好像變了……？\n以前的她不會那樣說話的……=Does she seem different? She never used to say stuff like that before.
嗯……是碰到了什麼事嗎，{{A}}……=Yeah... What happened to her?

今天怎麼說？去不去{{A}}？=What are we doing today? \nGoing to the {{A}}?
雖然下一個{{A}}還不知道在哪啦。=We still haven't found the next {{A}}.
當時{{A}}……\n你們是用他的全名找到的吧……？=With {{A}}, you said you found it by listening for his full name, right?
嗯，只要知道{{A}}現實中的真名，\n吾便能相對容易地在{{B}}聽到心聲。=Yes. It's easier to find Palace rulers through the collective unconscious if I know their full names.
{{A}}和{{B}}做的事都算社會話題了吧，\n現實世界現在還有這種人嗎……=But there aren't many people causing an uproar in the real world on the same level as {{A}} and {{B}}.
那不如換一個角度來看吧。=We should consider changing our approach, then.
{{B}}和{{C}}，兩人的共同之處，\n在於他們都是「{{A}}」，對吧？=Think of what {{B}} and {{C}} had in common. They were both {{A}}s.
{{A}}是叫匿名{{B}}……{{C}}叫惡意評論家？\n唔，他們兩個都是有官方認定的。=And they were officially condemned by Magatsukami. {{A}} as the {{B}}, and {{C}} a corrupt food critic.
嗯，因為是壞人所以才能有{{C}}，\n那{{A}}是{{B}}，的確也說得過去……=Well, I guess since {{C}}s pop up around bad guys, assuming the next ruler could be another {{A}} isn't much of a reach.
意思是，現在{{A}}上熱度高的{{B}}……\n就是下一個{{C}}的備選？=Does that mean one of the {{B}}s trending on {{A}} right now could be our guy?
嗯……騎車不守規矩的「{{A}}」……\n這別說是名字，連長什麼樣子都不知道呢。=Hmmm... A reckless cyclist known as the {{A}}... No one knows their name or face.
還有這個……「K高中的{{A}}Ｋ」……=And then there's K-sensei, the {{A}} of K Academy...
……{{B}}，這個沒問題！肯定成不了{{A}}！\n再看看其他人吧……=Let's skip that one! Who else...
不，不能說沒問題，\n{{B}}也已經是{{A}}了。=No, we can't take her off the suspect list yet. {{B}} is a {{A}}.
怎麼會……？=Hah...?
{{A}}你在說什麼啊……！{{B}}她只是……\n被一些自私任性的人拍了影片上傳而已！=What're you talkin' about, {{A}}!? {{B}}'s only up there because of those selfish dumbasses!
話雖如此，吾也只是就事論事。=That may be the case, but I'm simply stating the facts of the matter.
實際上{{C}}已經被{{A}}選了出來，\n也被大眾認知為了{{B}}。={{C}} appeared on {{A}} and became known to the public as a {{B}}.
那、那又不能說明什麼……！=Fine, maybe that happened, but still...!
上次你也這麼說過吧，{{A}}……=You mentioned that the other day, too, {{A}}.
……退一萬步說，\n就算{{B}}被當成{{A}}了。=Well, I guess she is being treated like a {{A}}.
但這不能說明就有{{B}}吧？{{C}}她……\n不可能會是{{A}}那樣的壞人……！？=But that doesn't mean she has a {{B}}, right? She's not like those other two...!
唔！等等，{{A}}，有人來了。=Ah! Wait, {{A}}. Someone's coming.
{{A}}，耽誤一點時間可以嗎？\n你們兩個也一起。={{A}}, can I speak with you?\nYou two as well.
是關於這個影片的事……=It's about this video...
這個影片……\n是{{A}}那個{{B}}的預告……？={{A}}'s {{B}} announcement...?
啊！{{A}}不是把頻道都刪了嗎，\n那些影片應該也沒有了才對啊……=What!? I thought he deleted the channel. All his videos should be gone...
……那個頻道人氣還是很高的，\n應該是被轉載過不少吧。=He was a famous streamer, \nso it got reposted all over the place.
r:"^我跟(.*)和(.*)之前談過一次……\n這個事還沒有和(.*)確認過。$"="I talked about it with $1-kun and $2-san before, but I didn't check with you yet, $3."
這個被指名參加對決的男生……\n雖然看不到臉，但，是你吧……{{A}}？=The boy named as the opponent... His face is hidden, but it's you, isn't it, {{A}}?
{{A}}，啊……不是、那個其實……！=Uh, no! That's um— That's not...!
那天，我記得你們3個下午都蹺課了，\n而且是一起返回學校的。=That day, all three of you skipped afternoon classes and came back to school together.
那時候你們是去了{{A}}那裡……\n我說的沒錯吧？=You paid {{A}} a visit, didn't you?
{{A}}你誤會了=You're mistaken
是去吃漢堡了……=<size\=28>We went out for burgers...</size>
r:"^喂，你，(.*)！噓～～$"="The hell—!? $1! Shhh!"
嗯，謝謝你老實回答我。=Thank you for answering honestly.
漢堡？\n這個理由……未免太牽強了。=Burgers? Likely story.
我不是在責備你們，放心，\n而且我也不打算告訴其他{{A}}，只是……=Don't worry, you're not in trouble. \nAnd I won't tell the other teachers.
在那之後……{{A}}就引退了，\n他原本是很有影響力的藝人吧？={{A}}'s retirement caused a real stir since he was a fairly powerful celebrity up till then.
如果你們和那種人發生了衝突，\n我希望當時你們能和我商量一下……嗯。=And if you were involved in a dispute with someone like that, well, I wish you would have come to me for help.
作為大人……不，應該是作為你們的{{A}}，\n我也想盡一點力幫助你們。=Because as an adult... Or really, as your teacher, I want to help you all in any way I can.
另外，你們3個最近總是在一起，\n如果只是關係好，那倒沒什麼問題……=You three are together a lot lately. If that's just because you're friends and all, that's great, but...
就怕，\n你們是不是又遇到了什麼麻煩了？=I'm worried that you might still have some problem you're dealing with.
為什麼你會知道……！=How did you—
啊，不是，{{A}}……什麼麻煩也沒有！=Ah, uh, nope! We're uhhh, all good! Right as rain!
你那個表情，是被我……說中了嗎？\n{{B}}，畢竟{{A}}是個不會撒謊的孩子。=You're a terrible liar, {{A}}. {{B}}. Your face says it all.
如果你們有困難，希望能告訴我……\n千萬不要獨自去做什麼危險的事。=If you're in trouble, I want you to talk to me. Don't do anything dangerous on your own.
……對，對不起！\n就算是{{A}}……我也不能說！=I'm sorry! This is something we just... can't tell you!
我們的確遇到了問題……\n但是，不想把{{A}}……牽扯進來……=It's not that there isn't a problem, but... \nI just don't wanna get you involved...
理由也好、藉口也好……我們都不能說。=I can't tell you that either.
不過……我們肯定沒問題的！\n我們一定會找出解決辦法的！=But... We're totally fine! \nWe'll get through this one way or another!
希望{{A}}相信我們=Have faith in us
相信我們吧=Trust us
嗯，{{A}}不用為我們操心的！=Yeah, there's no need for you to worry yourself sick over us!
……我就那麼不值得相信嗎……？=Am I really that unreliable...?
這樣不太合適哦～？{{A}}不是告訴過你，\n課外時間禁止與學生接觸嗎。=This is no good. The {{A}} already told you, fraternizing with students outside of class is prohibited.
{{A}}，禁止……=What do you mean prohibited...?
{{A}}現在……應該說是「網紅」了吧？\n可不能影響學生哦。=Right now you're persona non grata. We can't have you making the students uneasy.
{{A}}，沒關係的……=It's okay, {{A}}...
不好意思，我這就回辦公室。=Please forgive me. \nI'll return to the faculty office at once.
你們……如果真遇上困難……=When the three of you are really struggling...
一定要找大人幫忙……\n……不找我找別人也行……=Please ask an adult for help. \nEven if it's someone other than me.
我只是想和你們說這些。\n我先走了……=That's all I wanted to say. \nAnyway... Excuse me.
真不容易啊，同學們。=That must have been quite trying for you all.
……{{A}}，\n她只是擔心我們想幫忙而已。={{A}} was worried about us and came to give us some advice.
哦？如果你們需要建議，\n作為教育顧問的我，可以幫忙哦？=Oh? If you need advice, maybe I can help. I am an educational consultant after all.
r:"^2年C班，(.*)同學，(.*),\n2年D班，(.*)。$"="$1-kun and $2 from 2C, \nand $3 from 2D."
為什麼，知道我們的名字……=How do you know our names...?
我的這個智慧眼鏡，很方便吧？\n還可以和學生名冊進行人臉比對呢。=Neat, isn't it? These smart glasses allow me to match faces against the student register.
總之，如果你們有任何問題或改進建議，\n歡迎隨時找我哦，告辭。=Anyways, I'm always open to listening to problems or taking suggestions for school improvements.
感覺……這個{{A}}，\n一開始以為是好{{B}}，現在覺得有點嚇人啊。=I thought he was a good teacher at first, but {{A}}'s kinda creepy, huh?
哼，反正我不喜歡他。=Can't say I've ever been a fan.
真是的，終於可以繼續作戰會議了。\n剛才說到一半就被迫中斷了……=Thank goodness. We can finally resume our strategic meeting. So, as I was saying...
吾打算，\n用「{{A}}」的名字來找一下{{B}}。=I think I'd like to try searching for a {{B}} with the name {{A}}.
喂！？為什麼還要說這個啊！=What!? Would you drop it already!?
冷靜一點，\n這也是能夠證明{{A}}並非{{B}}的方法。=No need for such ire. We could end up proving that she has no Palace.
把想到的名字，一個個進行篩選，\n眼下也只有這個方法了吧？=We'll simply try each name we can think of and eliminate suspects one by one. That's our only option at the moment.
{{B}}……怎麼試都是浪費時間，不過，\n如果{{A}}覺得這麼做心裡踏實，我沒意見。=Tch... Seems like a waste of time to me. But if it'll lift your suspicion, then whatever floats your boat, {{A}}.
那就決定了，\n吾等儘快去{{A}}吧，隊長。=Then it's settled. Let's go to the {{A}} as soon as we can, Leader.

----------
Chapter 3 Part 1 Metaverse Start
----------
反正也找不到。=I still don't think you're gonna find anything.
哎呀，就是為了證明{{C}}她不是{{B}}，\n所以我們才來{{A}}的嘛，SOY。=That's exactly why we came here to make sure, Soy.
知道了啦……=Sure, but still...
……找到了。=...Found it.
用{{A}}的名字，\n吾感知到了{{B}}的氣息，不會有錯。=I've detected a {{B}} with the name {{A}}. There's no doubt about it.
肯定搞錯了，不可能的！=No way! You're wrong!
片、{{A}}真的是，{{B}}……嗎……？=Is {{A}} really a {{B}}...?
怎麼可能！\n一定是別人的{{A}}吧，CATTLE！？=No freakin' way! Are you sure it's not someone else, Cattle!?
不，{{B}}內的意識，\n對{{A}}的名字發生了反應，不會有錯。=No, the name {{A}} is definitely causing voices in {{B}} to react.
不過……氣氛有點奇怪。\n似乎混入了類似雜音……干擾訊號的東西……=But there's something strange about them... It's like there's noise making the voices jumbled up...
{{A}}那時候，並沒有這種感覺。={{A}} was nothing like this.
那這算什麼，怎麼回事……\n為什麼{{B}}會有{{A}}……=Are you kidding me? \nHow could this happen...?
朝{{A}}出發吧=<size\=29>Let's head for the {{A}}</size>
親眼確認一下吧=<size\=24>We have to see it for ourselves</size>
嗯……也沒別的選擇了，\n既然找到了，那就去看看。=Yeah... Now that we found the place, \nwe have to check it out.
……雖然有點對不住CATTLE，\n但在親眼看到之前，我不會信的。=Sorry, Cattle, but I won't believe this till I see it with my own two eyes.
走吧，WONDER！=Let's go, Wonder!
趁著吾還沒有跟丟這個氣息，\n眼下先查明下一個{{A}}的位置。=We need to pinpoint the location of the next {{A}} before I lose the trail.
喂，這邊……=Whoa, is this...?
嗯……跟{{A}}和{{B}}的情況一樣，\n{{D}}的存在有別於{{C}}的其他區域。=Yes. Just like with {{A}} and {{B}},\nthis {{D}} exists outside of {{C}}.
這裡真的是{{A}}……嗎？=Is this really {{A}}...?
只能進去看看了，走吧，WONDER。=We won't know without a proper investigation. Let's go, Wonder.

----------
Chapter 3 Part 1 Palace Start
----------
這就是，{{A}}……嗎？=So this is... {{A}}?
這是什麼地方？好像不是……學校。=What kind of facility is this? \nPretty sure it's not a school.
似乎能看到遠處，\n那有一個巨大的建築物……=It looks like there's some kind of large structure in the distance...
想要到達那裡的話，\n得想辦法解決路障的問題。=But that barricade is blocking our path.
找找能潛入的地方吧，WONDER。=Let's find another way in, Wonder.
唔……你們聽到了水聲嗎？=Hoo... Do you hear water?
你這麼一說，真的有……\n感覺是……河流，瀑布之類的？=Yeah, I do... It's like the sound of a river or a waterfall, right?
到底這是什麼地方啊，\n這個建築是什麼……=What the hell is this place...?
似乎還可以繼續前進，去看看吧。=It seems we can still go further into the building. Let's have a look.
……好厲害……！=Whoa...!
這個{{A}}……！\n原來是「水壩」啊……！=Oh damn...! It's a dam...!
有水聲是因為這個啊=<size\=27>That's why we heard water</size>
好大啊……=It's really big...
……可是，為什麼是水壩呢？\n是{{A}}記憶中的地方嗎？=But why a dam? Is this a memorable place for her or something?
透過對水壩的探索，\n吾等自會了解這個認知從何而來。=We may learn why in the course of investigation.
吾等應該可以從那邊進去？\n去看看吧，WONDER。=Perhaps we can enter from over there? Let's go, Wonder.

道路被完全封鎖了……\n只能另尋他路了。=It seems there's no way past... \nLet us search for another way.
總覺得我們像非法入侵一樣……=This kinda feels like trespassing...
這裡又不是現實世界。別放心上啦。=We're not in the real world. \nDon't let it worry you.
真的要從這裡進入嗎……\n感覺會弄得全身又濕又髒的……=Do we really have to go in this way? \nIt looks all wet and gross...
雖然吾能理解你的心情，\n但似乎也別無選擇了。=I understand your concern, but there is no other way.
只能祈禱別有污水突然沖出來了……=We can only hope that no sewage is discharged...
我們進來了呢。\n趕緊找到出口吧。=Well, we're in. Let's just hurry and find a way out of here.
我說，你們不覺得奇怪嗎？\n這裡完全沒在排水啊。=Hey, isn't that a bit weird? \nLooks like it's not drainin' at all.
唔……的確有些在意，不過吾等也得以\n順利進來了。暫且不去追究了吧。=Hoom... That is unusual, but it's because of that that we were able to get in. We should consider it serendipitous.
這扇門……要如何打開才好呢？\n似乎沒有看到這扇門的開關啊……=There's the door... But how do we get it open? I see nothing resembling a lever or switch...
你們看，旁邊好像有個裝置呢。\n我們試試看？=There's some sort of device next to it. Should we see what it does?
哦……居然打開了！？=Whoa! It opened!
原來如此……看來只要使用這個裝置，\n就可以打開門呢。=I see... So we can use that device to operate doors, it would seem.
這個裝置似乎是靠電池運作的。\n也就是說，這扇門需要能量才能打開。=The device appears to be battery-powered, which would indicate it requires energy to activate.
能量啊……\n有種很麻煩的預感啊。=Energy, huh... \nGot a bad feelin' about this.
這個房間是幹什麼的啊……？=What is this...?
大家，快來看這個。=Hey, look at this.
這個畫面……\n似乎顯示著水壩的狀況？=This screen... It looks like it displays the current condition of the dam?
唔……這像是\n大壩的控制室。=Hoom... In short, I suppose this could be considered the dam's control room.
「水位異常」、「發電功率過高」……\n狀況看起來不容樂觀啊。="Dam Water Level Abnormal", "Power Over Capacity"... Things do not seem to be going well.
發電功率過高……？\n那為什麼門卻打不開啊？=Power over capacity? Then why couldn't we get the door open?
是線路損壞了？=Faulty circuits?
的確很奇怪=It does seem strange
吾也沒有頭緒呢。\n看來唯有繼續深入調查了。=I'm not sure what it could be, but it's worth investigating.

這條路好像走到頭了。\n附近有沒有其他路線呢？=It's a dead end. Could there be another path nearby?
上面是不是有陰影……？=Is that a Shadow up there...?
噓！小聲一點。=Shhh! Quiet!
能量終於快運輸完了啊。\n這次也有足夠的能量呢。=Energy transfer is almost complete. Should be more than sufficient this time.
剛才說話的就是那個陰影嗎？\n它好像在操作什麼裝置……=Is that the Shadow you mentioned earlier? What's that device he's operating...?
輸入開機口令……\n好了，開工！=The operation commands are entered...\nAlright, let's get to work!
什麼！？入侵者嗎！=What!? Intruders!
那麼，把剛剛那傢伙的口令\n輸入進去看看吧。=Now then, let's try entering the operation command that Shadow used earlier.
裝置好像啟動了。\n現在是能做什麼了嗎？=Looks like it's turned on. \nNow what can we do?
「能量轉移裝置」嗎……\n似乎能<color\=#ff0000>吸收和釋放能量</color>。=A "Portable Energy Absorber"... It seems we should be able to <color\=#ff0000>absorb and release energy</color> with this.
吸收和釋放？\n怎麼一回事？=Absorb and release? \nWhat d'you mean by that?
比起說明，不如實際操作更容易理解呢。\nWONDER，你來操作看看。=Rather than a lengthy explanation, I think a demonstration would be sufficient. Wonder, try using it now.

好像是用它傳輸能量的呢。=It looks like the energy's been sent out.
哦哦……確實很便利啊。=Hoohoo... Now isn't that convenient?
之後遇到相同的裝置就活用起來吧。\n可別忘了開機口令啊。=If we find any similar devices later, we should be sure to use them. Don't forget that operation command!
這個是地圖嗎？寫著「底層廠區」呢。=Is this a map? It says "Lower Level"...
{{A}}的氣息離這裡還很遠。\n恐怕是在很靠上層的地方。=I sense the {{A}} is still quite far.\nProbably much higher up.
前方好像就是倉庫和電梯呢。\n我們繼續前進吧，WONDER。=It appears there's a storage area and an elevator ahead. Let's keep going, Wonder.
哇！是陰影嗎！？=Whoa, Shadows!?
{{A}}，數量也太多了吧！={{A}}, that's way too many of 'em!
先冷靜下來=Stay calm first
似乎沒有敵意=<size\=30>They don't seem hostile</size>
唔，正如WONDER所說。\n吾並沒有感受到這附近有敵人的氣息。=Hoom, it's as Wonder says. I don't sense the presence of enemy Shadows here.
那這些人到底是？\n雖然不知道該不該稱他們是「人」……=Then... who are these people? Uh, if "people" is the right word...
也許他們是由{{A}}製造出來的\n認知存在……呢。=These are cognitive manifestations created by the {{A}}'s perceptions... it would seem.
這樣嗎……也就是說，\n我們不用擔心被襲擊了呢。=Right, right... So, what you're saying is, we don't have to worry about them attacking us?
說不定還能溝通呢。\n要不要試試看和他們搭話？=Think we can communicate? Let's try talkin' to 'em.
說不定能獲得情報=<size\=28>They might have some info</size>
謹慎行事為好=<size\=28>Let's be careful about this</size>
唔。有一試的價值。\n不過，需要注意不要刺激到對方。=Hoom. I do suppose it could be worth a try. But do be careful not to provoke any unwanted attention.
說的沒錯。\n順利的話說不定能拿到什麼情報。=A fine idea. If we play our cards right, we could learn something valuable.
嗯？你們是來參觀水壩的嗎？\n真是挑了個壞時候過來呢……=Huh? Are you all here on a tour? Sorry, you came at a bad time...
壞時候？=A bad time?
<color\=#ff0000>新任主任</color>命令整個水壩進行全功率發電。\n還限制了各處電力的使用呢……=The <color\=#ff0000>new supervisor</color> ordered power generation to be set to full capacity. Some parts of the dam even had their power cut...
結果害得我們一直被困在這裡，\n也沒辦法進行<color\=#ff0000>水的處理</color>工作。=Thanks to that, we can't get out of here, and we can't do our jobs at the <color\=#ff0000>Water Treatment Plant</color>.
是你們……打倒了那些可怕的傢伙們？=Say, did you... defeat those scary-looking guys?
是說陰影嗎？=<size\=30>You mean the Shadows?</size>
因為很礙事=They were in the way
你們真厲害啊。\n我都害怕地不敢靠近一步呢……=Wow, you're amazing! I was too scared to go anywhere near them...
那些傢伙是被<color\=#ff0000>「新任主任」</color>派過來的。\n總之很執著於收集能量。=They showed up with that <color\=#ff0000>new supervisor</color>.\nThey're obsessed with gathering energy.
這裡到處都已經亂成一團了……\n<color\=#ff0000>{{A}}</color>也不知道去哪裡了。=This place is a mess... and we've got no idea where <color\=#ff0000>{{A}}</color> has gone off to!
傳聞<color\=#ff0000>{{A}}</color>在「發電廠」那邊，\n沒日沒夜地進行發電工作呢。=<color\=#ff0000>{{A}}</color> should be at the Power Plant, where she works round the clock to generate power.
但是如果再這麼全功率發電下去的話，\n水壩早晚會決堤的……=But, if we keep working at full capacity like this, the dam's likely to burst...
得到了不少有用的情報呢。=Seems we were able to learn something rather useful.
嗯。果然這座水壩……不，\n整個{{A}}的情況都非常危急呢。=Yep. Just like we thought, the dam... well, the {{A}} is in a pretty bad condition.
還有剛才提到的<color\=#ff0000>「新任主任」</color>，\n應該是指……{{A}}吧？=Also, this <color\=#ff0000>new supervisor</color> he mentioned... that was {{A}}, wasn't it?
雖然不確定……但既然這裡是{{A}}的\n{{B}}，那應該就是了吧……=Hard to say... but that would mean this is {{A}}'s {{B}}, then.
唔……不過，{{A}}在此被稱呼為主任，\n也讓人覺得很奇怪啊……=Hoom... But there was something odd about the way he referred to {{A}} as the supervisor.
總之先前進吧=Let's move on for now
繼續探索吧=<size\=28>We'd better keep exploring</size>
……也是。繼續猜想也無濟於事。\n繼續前進吧。=...You're right. Standing around thinking will get us nowhere. We must proceed.

看來想打開這裡\n也需要能量才行啊。=Guess we'll need some energy to open this one, too.
唔。必須先找到操控裝置呢。=Hoo... First, let us look for the control device.
看來需要兩份能量\n才能打開這扇門。=To open this shutter, it appears we will require two energy.
點擊「<color\=#ff3b37>切換</color>」\n操控附近其他「<color\=#ff3b37>能量轉移裝置</color>」=Click on [<color\=#ff3b37>Switch</color>] to control other nearby [<color\=#ff3b37>Energy Transfer Device</color>]
好，這樣應該就能打開了！=Alright, looks like that worked!
聽到了奇怪的聲音……=I heard a strange sound...
啊，等一下……！=Huh? That door...
竟然關上了。喂，陰影就由我們\n負責收拾掉，你們快開門。=It's closed, huh? Guess we'll have to take care of these Shadows to open it up.
<color\=#ff0000>那個新任主任</color>太可怕了……我要躲在這裡！\n無論發生什麼都決不開門！=That <color\=#ff0000>That new director</color>... is terrifying... I'm just going to hide here! I'm not opening that door for anything!
可惡……被鎖上了。=Shoot... It's locked up tight.
看樣子輕易不會打開呢……\n以後再來吧，WONDER。=I don't think we'll get in that easily... \nLet's come back later, Wonder.

嗯……？=Hmm...?
{{A}}，這個門，打不開啊。=This door won't open.
是不是鎖上了？=Maybe it's locked?
啊，看這！=Oh hey, look at that!
這是……數字密碼鍵盤？=Is this a keypad lock?
這個、就是那種鎖吧？\n只有輸入正確的數字，才能打開……="So it won't open without the right passcode...
真的假的，那應該輸入什麼啊？=God damn it. Okay, what should we try?
數字嗎……到目前為止，\n吾並沒有發現有關的線索。=A number, huh? I didn't see anything on the way in that seemed like a clue.
除了這個門，\n好像也沒有其他路可以走……=But this door looks like the only way ahead...
如果是{{A}}，\n那密碼肯定是跟{{B}}有關的數字……對吧？=Well it's {{A}}, so the numbers should have something to do with her, right?
SOY，你知道{{A}}的生日嗎？=Soy, do you happen to know her birthday?
啊，這個還真不知道……=Nah, how would I know that?
明明是重要的人？=<size\=27>Isn't she important to you?</size>
明明是喜歡的{{A}}？=I thought you liked her
啊……！別胡說啊！\n{{A}}只是……對我有恩的恩人……！=Ugh! What're you talkin' about!? {{A}}'s just... She looks out for me is all!
那你的臉為什麼紅起來了～？=Then why are you blushing～?
哪有啊！\n……我戴著面具你能看到臉才怪！？=Shut it! Wait, you can't even see my face through this mask!
你們阿，別在這說閒話了，\n這裡可是敵人的地盤。=Come now. Enough nonsense. \nThis is enemy territory.
嗯……SOY，\n那就想幾個有關聯的數字試試？=Good point... So, Soy, can you think of a number that might fit the bill?
唔，會不會是什麼諧音的數字啊？=Hmmm, maybe it's some kind of mnemonic?
2年C班所以是23？=Class 2C, so 23?
{{A}}的讀音所以是93？=<size\=22>Add the letters in {{A}} to get 54?</size>
{{A}}，有可能！\n……不過兩位數是不是太短了？=Oh, that's brilliant! \nBut I doubt it's a two-digit passcode.
那，{{B}}名字裡{{A}}的諧音，\n9、3這種呢？=Maybe we gotta replace the letters of her name with numbers and add them to get... 54?
{{B}}名字裡{{A}}的諧音是9、3啊～\n有道理……不過兩位數是不是太短了？=K, U, M, I, 11 + 21 + 13 + 9... That makes 54, but I doubt it's a two-digit passcode.
那，2年C班的班主任，\n所以是2、3？=Maybe it's 23 because she's the homeroom teacher of 2C?
那就把這兩個組合起來……=Well, if we combine them...
輸入９３２３=Input 5423
輸入２３９３=Input 2354
果然不會這麼簡單啊……=Well, that didn't work...
那不如從００００開始，\n一個個試試？=In that case, should we just try everythin' starting from 0000?
且慢，\n連密碼是不是四位數都不知道呢……=Well, we don't actually know if it's a four-digit number either...
{{A}}？聽到了嗎，有什麼聲音！？=Huh? What was that!?
什麼……是敵人嗎！？\n不妙，吾居然都沒有察覺到陰影接近！=Wha—!? An enemy!? Damn! I can't believe I didn't notice it approaching!
你們是，什麼人？\n無關人員可不准進來這裡哦？=Who might you be? This area is limited to authorized personnel only.
你們是，什麼人？\n無關人員可不准進來這裡哦！=Who might you be? This area is limited to authorized personnel only.
這誰啊……？\n不會是{{A}}吧？=Who's this chump...? \nDon't tell me he's the {{A}}?
不，他的氣息太弱了，\n弱到連吾都沒察覺到的程度。=No, his aura is too weak. \nNo wonder I couldn't sense him.
甚至，\n他比{{A}}那些遊蕩的陰影氣息都要弱。=In fact, his presence is even weaker than that of the wandering Shadows in {{A}}.
啊，比普通的陰影還弱啊？\n那沒事了～嚇我一跳……=Then he's weaker than a normal Shadow?\nGeez, I panicked over nothing...
那就是雜魚水準吧，趕緊收拾了。=In that case, let's roast this small fry and keep movin'.
哦～？雜魚！？=Small fry!? Excuse you!
初次見面就出言辱駡……\n你們也太不守規矩了。=Verbal abuse against someone you've just met is a violation of compliance.
但你們的判斷也沒錯哦？我不喜歡暴力，\n那種粗俗的事情找別人代勞就好了。=But I'll admit, I detest violence myself.\nSuch dirty business is best delegated.
但你們的判斷也沒錯哦！我不喜歡暴力，\n那種粗俗的事情找別人代勞就好了。=But I'll admit, I detest violence myself.\nSuch dirty business is best delegated.
不過，水壩目前正在接受一流的顧問指導，\n警衛隊伍的規模上還有待提高～=However, this dam is still undergoing consultation and lacks the proper security.
真是沒辦法～\n就由我親自排除掉侵入者吧。=Ah well, nothing for it～ \nI'll just have to take out these fools myself.

Chapter 3 Part 1 Shadow Akashi Boss

嗯～{{A}}……\n充滿了力量啊……！=Mwahahaha... \nI feel so alive...!
這，這是要幹嘛！？=What's with this guy!?
小心！\n這傢伙的力量……突然就增強了！=Stay vigilant! I can sense his power growing by the second!
來了！=Here it comes!
竟敢藐視我，\n我會讓你們後悔的！=You're going to regret underestimating me!
那傢伙似乎把慾望……\n也就是<color\=#ff0000>能量</color>儲存進了那個裝備。=He seems to be absorbing desire... and filling that apparatus with its <color\=#ff0000>energy</color>.
那傢伙似乎把慾望……\n也就是<color\=#ff0000>「能量」</color>儲存進了那個裝備。=He seems to be absorbing desire... and filling that apparatus with its <color\=#ff0000>energy</color>.
我就親自來處理一下吧！=It looks like I have some waste to dispose of!
我不喜歡暴力呢……\n不過這種方式如何？=I'm really no good with violence...\nHow's this?
呼……滲透進疲憊的身體了呢。=Ahhh, I feel like a new man.
這傢伙、搞什麼啊 ！？\n怎麼就恢復了啊！？=What the—!? \nDid he just heal himself!?
搞什麼啊、這東西 ！？\n怎麼就恢復了啊！？=What the—!? \nDid he just heal himself!?
啊，那個裝備的能量，\n似乎也可以用來恢復體力。=Yes. It seems the energy in his armor has restorative properties.
啊，那個裝備的<color\=#ff0000>「能量」</color>，\n似乎也可以用來<color\=#ff0000>恢復體力</color>。=Yes. It seems the energy in his armor has <color\=#ff0000>restorative properties</color>.
但能量應該是有限的，\n只要吾等繼續攻擊，遲早會枯竭。=Still, it's likely finite. A steady offense should eventually wear him down.
但<color\=#ff0000>「能量」</color>應該是有限的，\n只要吾等繼續攻擊，遲早會枯竭。=Still, it's likely finite. A steady offense should eventually wear him down.
哼……你們這幫入侵者還真是頑強啊，\n那我也要動真格的了。=My, what tenacious little fools. \nI suppose I'll have to spare no effort.
雖然不解饞，但這個「味道」我了解了，\n你的攻擊可就不管用了哦？=I'm not quite sated, but I've gotten enough of a taste. Your attacks are powerless against me now.
{{A}}，「味道」！？什麼意思啊！？=Huh? "Taste"!? A taste of what!?
看來他分析了吾等的攻擊，\n獲得對應的耐性，不太妙……謹慎出手吧。=He's analyzed our attacks and made himself immune to them. What a nuisance... We'll need to act carefully.
看來他分析了吾等的攻擊，獲得了對應<color\=#FF0000>屬性</color>的<color\=#FF0000>「防壁」</color>，不太妙……謹慎出手吧。=Seems he has put up a <color\=#FF0000>barrier</color> attuned to our attacks... How troublesome.
{{A}}，我就提高一下強度吧。\n下次可會更疼了哦。={{A}}, time to turn it up a notch.\nThis next one may shock you.
那就給你指導一下吧，\n可能會有點痛哦？=Now for your free consultation. \nThis will hurt quite a bit.
好耶，有效果！能拿下了！=All right! It's working! Let's keep it up!
開始還以為他能有兩下子呢……\n結果就這水準啊！=I thought we were in trouble at first, \nbut we got him on the ropes!
哦～？=Excuuuse me?
啊～啊……真讓人頭疼啊，\n所以我才會討厭凡事都訴諸暴力的笨蛋吧。=Ahhh... This is exactly why I can't stand little fools who know nothing but violence.
笨蛋存在的意義，就是被我利用啊……\n難道你們還不明白這種上下級關係嗎……=But I can use fools... \nThey don't understand the hierarchy at play...
{{A}}……真拿你們沒辦法，\n為了讓你們愚蠢的大腦也能明白……={{A}}... You leave me no choice. So your feeble brains can comprehend...
我就好好給你們進行一場顧問指導吧！！=It's time I give you a thorough consulting!!
莫非……！？=Is it—!?
{{A}}，那傢伙把所有損傷都恢復了！=It healed all of the damage we've dealt so far!
不是吧！？\n那我們剛才……全白打了？=You're kidding! \nSo our attacks were all for nothing?
嗯，而且繼續戰鬥下去的話，\n他很有可能還會不斷恢復！=Yes. And if we keep battling like this, it's possible it'll just keep recovering!
繼續戰鬥並非上策！\nWONDER！做出指示吧！=Continuing to fight isn't a good idea!\nWonder, give us your orders!
戰略性撤退！=Strategic retreat!
CATTLE，用遁逃彈！=Cattle, Vanish Ball!
了解！=Understood!

不見了……\n看來越笨的人逃的也越快呀。=They're gone... \nFools are quick to turn tail and run.
看來那傢伙已經離開了。=Seems it left.
呼……得救了～=Phew... Thank god～
怎麼辦，怎麼打他都能完全恢復的話……\n相當於這是個無敵的陰影啊？=That Shadow healed itself completely.\nIs it invincible?
好像他剛才往地上插了電線……=There was that cable thing it stuck into the ground.
那個陰影不會就是透過這個方法，\n增強力量或是恢復體力的吧？=Maybe that gave it a power boost or helped it recover or something?
看起來正是如此，\n透過電線吸收著這個{{A}}的能量……=It did seem that way. Almost as if it absorbed the energy of the {{A}} through that cable
吸收能量……？=Absorbing energy...?
還能這麼幹？=Is that even possible?
嗯……這或許，\n跟這座{{A}}呈現出水壩的形態有所關聯。=Hoom... It may have to do with the {{A}} being shaped like a dam.
難不成……是把水壩發的電，\n變成了自己的能量？=You mean it's sapping electricity made by the dam and using it to power itself?
{{A}}，那這太耍賴了啊！？\n我們打一輩子也打不倒他啊！=Wait, isn't that cheating!? We could hammer away at that thing for years and it wouldn't take a scratch!
這裡是{{A}}認知中的堡壘，\n就算不合理也是能夠實現的……=This is a cognitive stronghold of the ruler's own design. Unfairness is to be expected.
可……不是說這是{{A}}嗎？\n為什麼這個陰影也辦得到啊？=But, this is {{A}}, isn't it? What's a thing like that doing here in the first place?
不清楚，吾也是頭一次遇到這種事，\n總之依照眼下的情況……=I have no idea. I've never seen anything like this before. Anyway...
即使躲過了剛才的陰影，\n也會被密碼鎖擋住去路。=Even if we manage to get past the Shadow, there's still the number lock to contend with.
最好先回現實世界，考慮應對之策。=Let's head back to reality and plan our next course of action.
現在應該先撤退，\n回到現實世界吧，WONDER。=We should retreat for now. \nLet's return to reality, Wonder.

Chapter 3 Part 1 First Infiltration End
----------
呼，安全返回……=Phew! Glad we made it back safely...
啊，剛才那個奇怪的陰影……\n不會就是{{A}}吧？=That weird Shadow from earlier... Was that supposed to be {{A}}?
怎麼可能啊！？\n那個噁心的陰影怎麼可能是{{A}}！=No way in hell! That disgusting creep couldn't possibly be her!
所謂陰影，本就是現實中本人的相對存在，\n以慾望暴露在外的姿態於{{A}}中現身……=Shadows exist in conjunction with their real-life counterparts. They manifest the desires of their other self.
如果本人是這般「認知」自己，那麼，\n其外表看起來與現實相差甚遠也不足為奇。=Depending on how the person perceives themself, their Shadow can appear vastly different than how they look in reality.
不是，那也得有個限度吧？\n剛才那個陰影說話的聲音明顯是男的啊？=Okay sure, but there's a limit. \nDidn't that thing have a man's voice?
我也覺得，那個陰影，\n跟{{A}}的形象差的太遠了……=It did. And it was so far removed from my image of {{A}}, it was almost like...
……不過，\n感覺有個人跟那個陰影很像……=Or I guess, it really was like the Shadow reminded me of a different person entirely.
聲音很像{{A}}=<size\=27>Sounded like {{A}}</size>
提到了顧問之類=<size\=21>It threatened to consult us to death</size>
啊，對對！跟{{A}}聲音很像！\n而且語氣都很像！=Now that you mention it, it DID sound like {{A}}! Tone and everything!
這麼一說我想起來了……他好像還說過，\n什麼正在接受顧問指導之類的話？=Oh yeah. It said something about "consulting" too, didn't it?
顧問……？=Consulting...?
{{B}}！我想起來了！\n跟{{A}}的聲音很像！=Oh, that's it! The voice sounded just like {{A}}'s!
這麼一說，那種裝腔作勢的語氣，\n確實很像{{A}}啊。=Oh yeah. Had the same pretentious lilt to it too.
也就是說，那個{{C}}不是{{A}}的……\n而是{{B}}的？=So that {{C}} wasn't {{A}}'s...\nIt was {{B}}'s?
肯定是這樣！\n早說了{{A}}怎麼可能是{{B}}啊……！=Yes, that must be it! I knew {{A}} couldn't be a {{B}}!
但吾的確是……\n透過「{{A}}」的名字找到{{B}}的。=But I found the {{B}} from the name of "{{A}}."
那座{{B}}，\n的的確確是由{{A}}所創造。=There's no doubt that the {{B}} was created by {{A}}.
啊，那為什麼{{A}}在那啊！？=No way! Why the hell would {{A}} be in there, then!?
那是{{A}}創造出的存在……把那個陰影，\n當成{{B}}的「認知存在」或許比較妥當。=It's possible that {{A}}'s mind constructed him as well. Like a sort of "cognitive being."
{{A}}的……認知存在……？=A cognitive being... of {{A}}?
就是{{A}}心目中，{{B}}的形象。=Essentially, the version of {{B}} that {{A}} imagines in her heart.
{{D}}～你意思是，{{A}}心裡的{{B}}，\n在保護著她的{{C}}啊？=Uh-huuuh... So you're saying the {{B}} in her heart protects the {{C}}?
就像是那種騎士守護的關係……\n他們兩個，我實在沒法想像……=I really can't see him being her knight in shining armor though...
同意，硬要說的話，\n那也應該反過來，反過來才對。=Yeah. If anything, \nit's the total opposite.
嗯，總而言之，\n如果那是{{A}}的認知存在……=Well, to summarize, if that's {{A}}'s cognitive being...
如果吾等能了解到現實中{{A}}和{{B}}的關係，\n或許就能找到打倒那個無敵陰影的突破口。=We may be able to overcome its invincibility if we learn more about the relationship between them.
嗯，那關於{{A}}和{{B}}的事，\n我們就好好查一查。=Right. Let's investigate what's going on with them!
行，而且也有可能發現，\n{{A}}會有{{B}}的原因……=Sounds like a plan. Maybe that'll help us find out why {{A}} ended up with a {{B}} in the first place, too.
今天大家都累了吧，回去好好休息吧。=I think we've done enough for one day. We should head home and get some rest.

{{A}}的拉麵，還有我做的拉麵……\n最少也要吃兩碗，做好心理準備哦！={{A}} and I are cookin' up each of our special ramens, so get ready to eat at least two bowls!
好的～包在我們身上！=All right～ I was born ready!
能吃完嗎……=<size\=26>I wonder if I can eat all that</size>
那就不客氣了！=Let's eat!
客氣什麼啊，能看到你們的笑容，\n我們也很開心啊。=Not a problem. \nYour smiles are the only thanks we need.
沒問題！\n有我在，放心吧！=Don't you worry! \nI'll eat whatever you can't finish!
這哪兒來的自信……=That's more worrying...
這哪裡來的自信……=That's more worrying...

我也來幫忙。=Let me help you out.
你今天就好好坐著吧。=I'm fine! Sit, sit!
你這小子，店重新開張後一次都沒來過，\n真是個忘恩負義的弟子啊，寒心啊。=I can't believe ya haven't come by once since the reopenin'. Some apprentice! Ya break an ol' man's heart.
不是，我也是今天才知道的啊！\n我要早知道，我肯定早就來了……！=But—! I only found out today! \nI woulda come the second I knew...!

{{A}}，沒關係的呀，\n況且今天可是包場呢。={{A}}, it's no problem at all. \nYa have the place to yourselves today.
我會給你叉燒和水煮蛋哦，\n別著急，小寵物貓頭鷹！=I'll also throw in some stewed eggs with the pork. Hope you're hungry, pet owl-kun!
……寵物……！？=...Pet...!?
嗯嗯～！太好吃了～！\n鰹魚乾的香味像是在嘴裡爆發了一樣！=Mmm! This is amazing! My mouth's exploding with bonito goodness!
{{A}}，不錯吧？\n這就是{{B}}拉麵的真正味道。={{A}}, right!? That's {{B}}'s patented flavor.
哦哇～～！！=Hooaaah～～!!
太美味了……！如此美味的食物，\n一直以來都沒讓吾吃上，真是無法原諒……=This is life-changing! How dare you three keep this flavor all to yourselves!? The nerve...
那也沒辦法啊？如果不是包場，\n哪家店肯讓貓頭鷹進來吃飯啊。=Like we had a choice? You can't bring an owl into a restaurant. We had to book the place out just so you could try the food.
{{A}}，那個，你這麼說話沒問題嗎？\n{{B}}他們要是聽到會被嚇暈過去吧……=Anyway, should you be talking right now? {{B}} and Masa-san would freak out if they heard you.
這一點放心，\n一般人是聽不到吾的聲音的。=You don't have to worry about that. \nRegular people can't hear my voice.
唯有具備慾望素養之人方能聽到吾的聲音，\n也就是能使用{{A}}的人阿。=Only people with strong potential for desire, who can use the {{A}}, are able to understand me.
{{A}}和{{B}}如今雖然有了慾望……\n但他們的內心尚不如你們那般強大。={{A}} and {{B}} have desires, but not the strength of heart that you all possess.
……好像沒太懂，\n反正他們聽不到就行了。=I don't really get it, \nbut I guess that's just how it is...
{{A}}，你怎麼從剛才起，\n就一個人在那絮絮叨叨的？　={{A}}, what're you muttering to yourself about?
{{A}}，你怎麼從剛才起，\n就一個人在那絮絮叨叨的？={{A}}, what're you muttering to yourself about?
啊～太幸福了～怎麼可以這麼幸福～=Ahhh～ I think I died and went to heaven～
{{A}}，你們肚子還有空嗎？\n接下來打算做我的拉麵了……={{A}}, think you have room for seconds? I was just about to start cooking my ramen.
沒問題！空著呢！=Yes, please! Of course I do!
聲音好大，\n而且又是秒答！=Too loud and too fast!
真好呀，看到大家吃這麼開心，\n我都忍不住跟著笑起來了呢。=This is great. Seein' you all eat your fill makes me so happy.
說起來，\n你們倆……是{{A}}班上的學生吧？=That reminds me, you two are in {{A}}'s class, aren't ya?
{{B}}……？{{C}}，是{{A}}啊！\n你們認識嗎？={{B}}...? Oh, you mean {{A}}! Do you two know each other?
啊，我忘了說了，\n今天來這兒也打算聊聊這個事。=Whoops. Did I forget to mention that? Pops and Masa-san were hopin' to ask about her today.
啊，我忘了說了，\n今天來這裡也打算聊聊這個事。=Whoops. Did I forget to mention that? Pops and Masa-san were hopin' to ask about her today.
{{A}}和{{B}}，\n在學生時代都是{{C}}的常客吧？={{A}} and {{B}} were both regulars here since they were students, right?
嗯，沒錯，{{A}}和你們差不多大的時候，\n經常來這裡呢。=That's right. {{A}} came by a lot when she was around your age.
那時候啊，\n你們都想像不到他倆有多叛逆呢……=But they were both such wild kids back then, you'd hardly recognize 'em...
哎呀，那時候……是年少輕狂吧……\n抱歉當時給{{A}}添那麼多麻煩啦…=Well, umm... Let's just call that the rashness of youth. Sorry about all that.
{{A}}叛逆啊……\n難道是那種不良少年少女嗎……？=What!? Wild? Do you mean you were like, delinquents...?
對啊，{{A}}和{{B}}以前都是「不良」哦。=Yup. You could say they're both reformed delinquents.
{{A}}以前是不良少女……！？={{A}}'s an ex-delinquent...!?
原來是這樣……！=Really...!
太意外了=I can't picture it
再來碗拉麵=More ramen please!
你也沒想到吧，\n完全想像不出來啊……！=Right!? It's really hard to believe seeing how she is now...!
{{A}}，現在說這個！？=Um, hello!?
現在在聊的……不是{{A}}嗎……？=You do know we're in the middle of talking about {{A}} now, right?
唔，以現在{{A}}的形象，\n完全想像不出她以前是不良啊……！=Hang on, I can't imagine the teacher we know now as a delinquent...!
那時候的{{B}}，可是很有名的哦？\n人稱「{{A}}」呢。=She was famous back then, you know. {{A}}, they called her.
那時候的{{B}}，可是很有名的哦！\n人稱「{{A}}」呢。=She was famous back then, you know. {{A}}, they called her.
閃光……腿……！？=Lightning Legs!?
我也頭一次聽說……那是什麼啊？=That's the first I heard a this. \nWhat's it mean?
當時在東京市內，\n有著被稱為四大天王的不良頭目。=Back then there were four big gang leaders in the city.
{{A}}作為其中之一，\n與其他三大天王爭鬥不斷。={{A}} was one of 'em, and they were all fightin' for control over the rest.
好厲害……\n這種設定我只在漫畫裡看過啊……！=Whoa! That's like something out of a manga...!
當時因為我們學校的學生被欺負了，\n{{A}}就一個人騎車跑到荒川的堤壩上頭。　=One time, a student was attacked near Arakawa River, so she rode her bike all the way there to serve up some justice.
當時因為我們學校的學生被欺負了，\n{{A}}就一個人騎車跑到荒川的堤壩上頭。=One time, a student was attacked near Arakawa River, so she rode her bike all the way there to serve up some justice.
只憑著一條左腿，\n把其他學校的不良少女全都踹了個遍。=This other time, she took down a whole gang of delinquents from another school with just a left kick.
左腿……啊，所以叫閃光腿啊！\n太帥了吧……！=Just a kick? So that's why she's Lightning Legs! That's so awesome...!
{{B}}……雖然也有這個原因，\n不過主要是{{A}}騎自行車的速度超級快。=Ah, well that's part of it, but she was really known for pedaling her bike crazy fast.
{{B}}……雖然也有這個原因，\n不過主要是{{A}}騎腳踏車的速度超級快。=Ah, well that's part of it, but she was really known for pedaling her bike crazy fast.
每次我們大半夜騎摩托，她可以開著車燈、\n騎自行車就能追上我們……想想就很可怕……=When the gang went out on our motorcycles at night, she'd put a light on her bicycle an pedal after us till she caught up...
每次我們大半夜騎摩托，她可以開著車燈、\n騎腳踏車就能追上我們……想想就很可怕……=When the gang went out on our motorcycles at night, she'd put a light on her bicycle an pedal after us till she caught up...
{{A}}……是這個意思啊，閃光腿……=Ah, that's why she's Lightning Legs...
怎麼……這麼一說感覺立刻就變土了……！=Uh... When you put it like that it sounds pretty cringey...
{{A}}她啊，跟父母好像關係不太好，\n她總覺得自己在家裡沒有容身之處。={{A}}'s parents didn't get along, so she didn't really have a safe place to call home.
她說騎自行車的時候可以忘掉討厭的事情，\n所以就總騎著車到處亂跑……=She'd go ridin' her bike all over the place tryin' to forget about her troubles.
她說騎腳踏車的時候可以忘掉討厭的事情，\n所以就總騎著車到處亂跑……=She'd go ridin' her bike all over the place tryin' to forget about her troubles.
有一次還說「今天騎到水壩啦」之類的，\n然後返程就來我這吃拉麵。=She'd always stop by on her way home for a bowl a ramen sayin', "I rode to the dam today!"
水壩……？=The dam...?
不良少女們覺得她人太狂了，於是盯上了她。\n後來就開始了成天打架的日子。=Ya musta noticed she's got a bit of a short fuse. Back then it got 'er mixed up in all kinds a fights with other delinquents.
不過{{A}}高二的時候，當時她的班主任，\n那位{{B}}好像非常關心她、處處為她著想呢。=But her homeroom teacher in second year was real sympathetic to 'er.
所以{{A}}最後決定金盆洗手，\n為了當{{B}}，開始全力以赴學習和備考。=So she quit all a that and started studyin' hard to be a teacher.
那段日子，{{A}}也放棄當不良了，\n開始學做拉麵了呢。='Round the same time, {{A}} turned over a new leaf and started studyin' ramen.
來，久等啦，嘗嘗我的拉麵！=Here you go! Hope you enjoy the ramen that came about from all that!
還差{{A}}一碗，還有貓頭鷹吃的叉燒，\n稍等我這就端過來！=I'll bring over {{A}}'s bowl and some roasted pork for the owl right away!
啊，我來幫忙！=Oh, I'll get them!
多謝款待！=Thanks for the meal!
多謝款待！太好吃了！=Thank you so much! \nThat was seriously delicious!
{{A}}，路上注意安全呀，\n有空再來吃哦。='Course! Get home safe, ya hear? \nAnd come by again sometime.
別忘了也去{{A}}{{B}}轉轉！=Come by {{B}} in {{A}} too!
嗯，一定！=Yes! Of course!
唔，就這樣走了嗎？\n如果可以，還想打聽下{{A}}和{{B}}的關係……=Wait, is that it? I was hoping to ask more about {{A}} and {{B}}...
啊，這倒是。=Oh yeah, that's right.
那個，{{B}}，{{C}}，\n請問一下，{{A}}認識的人裡面……=Um, {{B}}, {{C}}, you've known {{A}} for a long time...
有沒有個叫{{B}}的人啊？\n是一個名字是{{A}}的男人……=Do you know a man named {{B}}? {{A}}...
……{{A}}？\n不知道啊，我沒聽說過。=...{{A}}? Never heard of him.
我也沒聽說過……那個人怎麼了嗎？=I never heard of him either... Why do you ask?
啊，沒事！\n如果不知道就沒什麼啦。=Oh, no reason! I was just wondering.
那我們先走啦，\n今天真的多謝款待了！=Anyway, thanks again for the feast today!
哎呀～肚子好撐啊～！\n真是……太幸福了……=Wooow. Call me a turkey, 'cause I'm stuffed! That was... the greatest few hours of my life.
吾也終於吃到了水煮蛋和叉燒，\n真是……太美味了……=And I finally got to savor that scrumptious pork and stewed eggs. The flavor was just... so... exquisite.
但如果想再品嘗到這種至上的美味，\n就只有包場才行吧……=But the only way I can enjoy that sublime dish again is to rent out the entire restaurant...?
有機會我做給你吃，\n雖然我還做不出{{A}}的那個味道。=I'll make it for you if you want. Mine's nowhere near as good as {{A}}'s though.
哦哦！一言為定，{{A}}！\n你不如每天都做吧，吾也沒有問題的！=Oh! I'll hold you to that, {{A}}! In fact, you can make it every day if you want!
不過……{{B}}以前是不良還真是沒想到啊，\n{{A}}你是早就知道了嗎？=Still.... I was shocked to hear about {{B}}'s past. Did you know any of that, {{A}}?
我也只是聽{{A}}偶爾提到幾句，\n閃光腿這種……我也是第一次聽說。=I'd heard a bit about it from {{A}}. The Lightning Legs thing was news to me though.
竟然能騎車騎到水壩，\n太厲害了吧。=Yeah, I can't believe she could cycle all the way to the dam!
啊……{{A}}之所以是水壩，\n難道就是那時候留下的印象嗎？=Ah... Maybe that's why her {{A}} is a dam?
……有這個可能。=...Could be.
可是他們兩個，\n都對{{A}}的名字沒有印象。=And yet, neither of them seem to have any recollection of {{A}}'s name.
嗯，說明至少不是跟{{B}}的過去有關係……\n{{A}}也不像是會跟不良打交道的人。=Yeah. They must be connected somehow, but seems like they weren't fellow delinquents.
這意味著，\n那座{{B}}應該就是{{A}}一個人的。=It seems that {{B}} must be {{A}}'s after all.
總之，今後也要繼續調查{{B}}和{{A}}的關係。=Well, anyhoo, we should continue investigating the relationship between the two of them.

Chapter 3 Part 1 Day 6
----------
……這個是？=...What's that?
給你買的，累了的時候，\n不是會特別想喝梅子果汁嗎？=A gift. Don't you ever feel like drinking plum juice when you're tired?
啊，不過自己家裡的商品，\n可能已經喝膩了吧……=Ah, but you're probably tired of drinking the same stuff you have at home...
不會，還是謝謝您的惠顧。=No, not at all. Thank you for buying it for me.
但作為{{A}}，\n我不能收受{{B}}的個人恩惠。=However, as a {{A}}, \nI cannot accept favors from teachers.
……你一點都沒變呢，還是那麼認真。=...As serious as ever.
其實{{A}}找你幫忙的工作，\n你可以直接拒絕的，不要傻乎乎地就做了……=You should say no to the {{A}} too. Don't just accept whatever he tells you to do.
沒有，這些工作是我願意接手的。=I don't mind the work.
真的嗎？可是……=Really? But...
這種資料整理的工作你都要做嗎？\n這些資料都和學生無關……=Why is he having you compile this kind of data? It has nothing to do with the students.
……因為{{A}}不太會用電腦。=...{{A}} and computers don't mix.
我很樂於在擅長的事情上能幫到{{A}}。=I like helping teachers with things I'm good at.
唔，你是認真的嗎？\n在我看來，你把自己逼得太緊了……=Do you really mean that? Because it looks like you're pushing yourself too hard to me...
你像是在拼命扮演大家心目中的優等生，\n寧可委屈自己……=I thought maybe you were sacrificing yourself to play the model student everyone expects you to be...
從那個時候起，就一直是這樣了……=Ever since back then...
就算是這樣，那又有什麼問題嗎？=Even if that were true, \nwhere's the problem?
我只是在做大家期望我做的事情，\n為什麼要因此受到責備呢？=I am fulfilling the role that's expected of me. Why should I have to feel guilty about that?
因為你還是個學生……是個孩子，\n原本就應該放手去做自己想幹的事情！=Because students... Children, should be allowed to live their lives freely!
不斷摸索真正喜歡的事，思考生活的意義，\n你現在是在這樣一個階段吧？=This is the time for you to discover what you like and think about what you want for your life.
而大人要做的就是去幫助你！\n而不是去剝奪一個孩子的自由！=Us adults are supposed to support that! \nNot crush children's hopes!
……那，我想做的事情，\n就是「給各位{{A}}幫忙」。=...What I want is to prove myself useful to the faculty.
{{A}}，你為什麼要這麼關心我？\n我太忙的話，是會對您有什麼影響嗎？={{A}}, why are you so concerned with what I'm doing? Does me staying busy trouble you in some way?
那是……因為，\n我一直都很在乎你……=Well... I've been worried about you for a long time now...
因為我是{{A}}社長的女兒，\n是將要接管公司的人選，所以你就在乎嗎？=Am I getting preferential treatment because I'm supposed to inherit {{A}}?
你在說什麼……！=What...!
……抱歉，我說得太過了。=...I'm sorry. That was rude of me.
總之，{{A}}你已經不是我的班主任了，\n沒有必要再關心我。=But you're no longer my homeroom teacher, so you don't need to worry about me anymore.
{{A}}……同學……={{A}}-san...
好了好了～就到這裡吧。\n不用再說什麼了～{{A}}～=All right, all right～ That's enough～ \nPack it in, {{A}}～
{{A}}……{{B}}……？={{A}}... {{B}}...?
上課之外的時間，禁止和學生接觸，\n要我說多少遍你才能聽呀～=Contact with students outside of class is strictly prohibited. How many times must you be told～
一定被嚇到了吧？\n你還好嗎，{{A}}？=That must have been scary. \nAre you all right, {{A}}?
我……沒事。\n{{A}}為什麼會在這裡？=I'm completely fine... What are you doing here, {{A}}?
{{A}}現在在做的工作，\n是我拜託給{{B}}的事吧？=You've been doing the work I asked the {{B}} to complete, correct?
我有些在意，所以……打算來看看情況，\n結果就聽到{{A}}生氣吼叫的聲音。=I remembered that, so I was on my way here to check when I heard {{A}} yelling.
生氣、吼叫……！？=Yelling...!?
還好我來得及時，\n趕在{{A}}對學生「再一次」施暴之前。=Thank goodness I made it in time before she got violent with another student.
你在說誰……！\n我怎麼可能做這種事！=Violent...!? I'd never do anything of the sort!
你看你，又變得那麼激動。=Oh look, there's that temper of yours again.
{{A}}，學生也不是小孩子了，\n他們是一個獨立的個體。={{A}}, students are not children.\nThey are individuals.
訓斥和強迫別人這種方式已經過時了，\n我們必須尊重彼此的人格。=Scolding them and suppressing their autonomy is a thing of the past. We must all respect each other as independent people.
保持邊界感還是很重要的，\n儘管你似乎沒有意識到，你此刻的行為……=Those kinds of boundaries are crucial. But you don't seem to realize, what you're doing is just...
只不過是「自我滿足」哦？=...self-gratification, isn't it?
只不過是「自我滿足」哦！=...self-gratification, isn't it?
這算什麼自我滿足！！\n你們分明是在利用她！！=Me!? You're the assholes using her for your own gain!
這算什麼改革工作方式……！\n算什麼培養學生的自主性……！=You call these reforms!? Why are you leaving students to fend for themselves!?
{{A}}是變輕鬆了，但壓力卻推到她的身上……\n這種做法根本就不是教育！=The teachers are taking it easy and putting all the burden on her! How is that education!?
即使是現在，{{A}}也肩負著家庭壓力，\n每天都在煩惱……！={{A}} is already struggling with her responsibilities to her family...!
不要再增加她的負擔了！\n不要再……折磨她的內心了！！=Don't make her bear such a heavy burden anymore! Stop making her suffer!
老……師……？=Sensei...?
你在幹什麼啊，{{A}}！！=What do you think you're doing, {{A}}!!
你沒事吧？{{A}}！\n幸好我看到你的訊息過來了……=Are you okay, {{A}}? I'm glad I noticed your message...
你這可是明顯的暴力行為啊，{{A}}！\n瞧瞧你幹的好事！=This is a clear act of violence, {{A}}! What on earth do you think you're doing!?
不、不是的，這是……=N-No, it's not... I...
愛自拍的女生=Selfie-Loving Girl
{{B}}～這不就是{{A}}嘛！\n我可是抓拍到最關鍵的瞬間了哦～=Whoa～ She really is a {{A}}! I got the best part on camera!
你，你們……=Y-You...
啊！？\n剛才的你們都拍下來了！？=You!? You recorded that!?
誰叫{{A}}讓我們等那麼久也不回來～=I mean, we were just waiting out here for {{A}} to come back foreeever.
愛拍影片的女生=Video-Loving Girl
明明{{A}}跟我們約好了，\n再教教我們拍影片的事情呢～=He promised he'd help us more with our videos～
慢著，你們倆把手機交出來！\n把影片刪掉！=Give me that phone! Delete the video!
啊，好凶啊！我才不要！=Whoa, yikes! Definitely not doing that!
哎呀真是的！{{B}}，這倆學生就交給你！\n那個，{{A}}！=Enough! {{B}}, please deal with these kids! And you, {{A}}...!
你跟我去辦公室……{{A}}，去接待室吧！\n我倒要聽聽你怎麼解釋！=I'll hear what you have to say for yourself in the faculty offi— No, the reception office!
……好的……=Okay...
要實話實說哦，\n我剛才把整個過程也都拍了下來。=There's no use in denying it. \nI recorded the whole thing as well.
{{A}}……你今天就先回去吧！\n另外，這件事不要和別人說，明白沒有 ！={{A}}... Go home for today! \nAnd tell no one about this! Got it!?
過程都拍下來了……？=He recorded the whole thing...?
今天{{A}}一開始就戴上了「智慧眼鏡」，\n這不是他平時的習慣……={{A}} has been wearing his smart glasses all day for some reason...
難道說，他從走進指導室那一刻起，\n就一直在拍攝嗎……？=Was he already recording when he entered the room...?
而且……那兩個來找{{A}}的學生，\n還有{{B}}過來的時機，也很湊巧……=And the timing of the {{B}} and those two girls showing up to meet {{A}} was too convenient...
r:"^啊，(.*)！不得了了！$"="Oh, $1! This is bad!"
這是，{{A}}……！？=This is, {{A}}...!?
公告欄上的通知，\n寫著{{A}}被停職處分了……=A notice saying {{A}}'s been suspended is posted on the bulletin board...
這上面寫「在校內動用暴力」……\n怎麼可能……=It says the reason was "violent behavior on school property." But she would never—
看熱鬧的男學生=Drama-Watching Boy
聽說她揪著{{A}}的衣領威脅他呢，\n瘋了吧。=I heard she grabbed {{A}} by the collar and threatened him. She's totally off the deep end.
看熱鬧的女學生=Drama-Watching Girl
{{D}}？{{C}}好可憐呀……\n{{B}}肯定是{{A}}吧，太可怕了……=Huh? Poor {{C}}... {{B}} really is a {{A}}. She's lost it.
{{A}}不可能做這種事！={{A}} wouldn't hurt a fly!
說、說什麼啊你……\n就是因為做了才被處分吧？=Wh-What are you talking about!? If she didn't do anything, this wouldn't be happening, would it?
輕浮的男學生=Flippant Boy
很快就要被官方認定成{{B}}了吧？\n這個處分通知，要不也發到{{A}}上去吧？=Only a matter of time till she's condemned now. Should we post a pic of the notice to {{A}}?
你們這些……！=You...!
別吵了。=Quiet, everyone.
馬上就要上課了，大家回教室吧。=First period is about to start. Report to your classrooms at once.
{{A}}～聽說你當時也在場，\n到底是不是真的呀？={{A}}～ Is it true you were there when it went down?
為什麼你會知道……=Where did you hear that...?
噢喲，看來是真的啊，\n{{C}}快告訴這人{{B}}就是{{A}}吧！=Whoa, it's true! Set this guy straight then. Tell him she's a violent Phantom of a teacher.
就因為是{{A}}，\n所以才下了停職處分了吧～？=She was suspended for being a {{A}}, right～?
……{{A}}，{{B}}，\n這類話題各位就不要胡亂猜測議論了。=...Enough wild speculating.
{{A}}停職期間的工作，\n會由其他{{B}}代勞。=The other teachers are handling {{A}}'s load while she's serving her suspension.
我們現在沒必要在這裡爭論，\n好了……再不回教室上課就要遲到了。=So there's no point in us making a fuss over it. Now get to class before you're all late.
什麼嘛，真沒意思～=Ugh, you're no fun～
本來還以為這個事，\n{{A}}肯定知道的比較多呢～=And I was sure the Disciplinary Committee Chair would tear Katayama to shreds...
那個，{{A}}……\n你當時在場是真的嗎……=Um, {{A}}... \nIs it true that you saw what happened?
你們也是，要遲到了哦。\n快回教室吧。=You're going to be late too. Head to class.
好……=Okay...
……不過……=But...
消息傳得好快。\n不……應該說是「太快了」。=That rumor spread quickly. \nMaybe too quickly...
{{A}}竟然會被停職處分……\n而且停多久好像也沒說……=I can't believe {{A}}'s suspended indefinitely...
根據學生們的各種傳言來看，\n{{B}}和{{A}}在{{C}}起了爭執……=Rumor has it {{B}} and {{A}} had an argument in the {{C}}. When Akashi-sensei rushed to the scene...
隨後{{B}}趕到現場，遭到{{A}}的暴力對待，\n{{C}}和幾名學生目睹了一切，是這樣吧。={{A}} attacked him, which the {{C}} and a number of other students witnessed.
{{A}}，為什麼要那麼做……=Why would {{A}} do something like that?
可是對方是{{A}}吧……\n這跟在{{B}}裡他們倆的關係，根本不一樣。=And to {{A}} of all people... \nIt's just like in the {{B}}.
唔，假如我們之前攻略了那個{{A}}，\n是不是就不會發生這種事？=Would things have gone differently if we'd been able to take down the {{A}}?
如果我們當時就打倒那個像{{A}}……\n是不是就不會有今天的事了？=If we'd defeated that {{A}}-lookin' Shadow... Could we have prevented this?
……雖然吾明白你想說的話，\n不過你先冷靜一下。=...I understand your point, \nbut let's think rationally for a moment.
首先，那可能不是{{B}}，\n暫且假設是從{{A}}心中產生的認知存在吧。=That being is probably not {{B}}. I hypothesize that it may be a cognitive form born from {{A}}'s mind.
不過當時吾等要是打敗了那傢伙，\n現實中{{A}}對{{B}}的感情也許會發生變化……=If we had defeated it, {{A}}'s feelings toward {{B}} in real life may have changed, but...
你意思是說，如果打敗那個陰影，\n{{A}}就不會這樣對{{B}}了嗎？=So if we'd defeated it, {{A}} might not have used violence against {{B}}?
可、還是感覺好怪啊……？\n那個陰影是在「守護」{{A}}吧？=But isn't it weird...? Why was he the one protecting {{A}}?
一個討厭到都快要打他的人，\n卻是守護自己內心的象徵，怎麼想都怪啊……=I don't get why someone she hates enough to throw hands with would be the symbol that protects her heart...
我也這麼覺得……=I think so too...
不過……可以確認的是，{{B}}對{{A}}來說，\n是個重要的存在，甚至能出現在{{C}}裡。=But if {{B}}'s showin' up in her {{C}}, he must be a big deal to {{A}} in some respect.
唔，無論如何還是要調查一下{{A}}，\n畢竟他和{{B}}有關係是事實。=In any case, let's investigate {{A}}. We know for a fact he's connected to the {{B}}.
嗯，不過要怎麼調查才好呢？\n比如找其他{{A}}打聽一下嘛……=Yeah. But how are we gonna do that? \nShould we try asking the other teachers...?
你們在聊什麼？=Asking them what?
理、{{A}}！？=R-{{A}}!?
不好意思，我不是故意偷聽的，\n……我只是想問一下。=I'm sorry, I didn't intend to eavesdrop, but I just want to confirm...
你們剛才是不是說了，「要調查{{A}}」？=Were you talking about investigating {{A}}?
好像是說了……=Perhaps...
好像沒說……=Perhaps not...
啊、啊？\n我們剛才聊什麼來著～？{{A}}～=Who can say, right? What were we talking about again...? {{A}}～
{{A}}，你這口哨吹得也太水了……=You're awful at whistling...
我們只是在說，很擔心{{A}}……=We were just talkin' about how worried we are about {{A}}...
……真巧，\n我也正想調查一下{{A}}。=...What a coincidence. I was also thinking of investigating {{A}}.
方便的話我們聯手怎麼樣？=Would you like to work together on this?
為什麼要調查{{A}}？=Why investigate them?
聯手是指？=Work together how?
嗯……在學校裡不方便說這個。=Well... I can't say any more about it here at school.
哼，偷聽我們聊天，\n理由也不說，還想我們跟你合作嗎？=Hey now! First you eavesdrop, now you're tellin' us to help you without givin' a reason?
喂，{{A}}！\n這麼說話太沒禮貌了！={{A}}! Don't be rude!
……我又沒說錯。=...We need to know.
{{A}}動手的時候，\n你也是目擊者之一吧？=You were there when it happened, right?
當著{{A}}的面，{{B}}還動手……\n你當時為什麼沒能阻止她？=Disciplinary Committee-sama was right there on the scene, but didn't do anything to stop her?
……嗯，你說的對，\n沒能阻止{{A}}，我也有責任。=...You're right. I am somewhat at fault for not stopping her.
所以……事情為什麼會發展到那個地步，\n我也想弄清楚，才會想要調查下{{A}}。=But I want to investigate {{A}} to find out why this situation occurred in the first place.
這件事說來話長，\n我們能不能在學校外面找個地方聊呢？=I need time to explain, so perhaps we could meet somewhere off campus?
想了解些情況=<size\=26>Well, we do want information</size>
可以先聽你怎麼說……=<size\=28>We'll at least hear you out</size>
謝謝,\n那定下時間後我給你發消息吧，{{A}}。=Thank you. I'll message you with the details then, {{A}}.
啊，沒問題！=Uh, sure! Sounds good!
她覺得自己也有責任……嗎。\n……要是這樣的話，或許能信任她一點。=She feels guilty about it, huh? \nMaybe we can trust her then.
唔，{{A}}你這個點抓得很好。=That's the spirit, {{A}}.
不過沒想到說話會被偷聽。\n這麼一來，等於{{A}}也失去了意義……=But to think that someone was eavesdropping on us. Some hideout this is.
{{A}}……\n下次我們還是多注意下周圍的情況吧。={{A}}... We'll have to keep a closer eye on our surroundings next time.
但是，\n{{A}}她……突然這是怎麼了……？=But {{A}}... I wonder where all this is coming from.

----------
Chapter 3 Part 1 Day 7
----------
{{A}}發消息過來了，\n問今天能不能見面。=I got a message from {{A}}. She wants to know if we can meet after school.
她正好有點事要辦，\n問我們傍晚能不能去<color\=#ff0000>{{A}}</color>那邊。=She said she has some errands to run first, so she wants us to meet her in <color\=#ff0000>{{A}}</color> tonight.
嗯，{{A}}那邊也OK。=Okay. {{A}}'s good to go too.
那就下北澤的車站集合吧，\n然後大家一起去{{A}}。=Let's meet at Shimo-Kitazawa Station in the evening and head to {{A}} together.
啊，來了來了！=Oh, hey! You're here!
都到齊了吧，\n走吧，去{{A}}。=That's all of us. Let's get to {{A}}.
我看一眼……\n約好是在<color\=#ff0000>咖啡廳</color>碰面。=So... We're meeting at a <color\=#ff0000>café</color>, right?
地圖上看，\n就在進口食品店那附近……=My map is showing a lot of imported food vendors ahead...
那邊在幹嘛？\n好像在拍什麼東西。=What's goin' on over there?\nLooks like they're filmin' somethin'.
唔？攝影機前面的那個人類，\n應該是{{A}}吧？=Huh? Isn't that {{A}} in front of the camera over there?
{{A}}梅乾產品的販售活動，\n會在{{B}}站舉辦，活動將持續到本週末。={{A}}'s umeboshi will be sold at {{B}} Station until the end of the week.
如果大家經過附近，歡迎順路過來看看。=Please stop by if you happen to be in the area.
TV攝製組=TV Crew
好，OK～！=All right! Ok～!
今天真的非常感謝。=Thank you very much.
{{A}}，好可愛啊……！\n這個、難道是、電視採訪！？=You look absolutely adorable, {{A}}...! Is this for TV!?
啊，抱歉，\n已經到了約定時間了啊。=Oh, I'm sorry. It's already the time that we agreed to meet, isn't it?
馬上就結束了，\n能麻煩你們再稍微等一會兒嗎？=I'll be finished soon.\nWould you mind waiting a little?
馬上就結束了，\n能麻煩你們再稍微等一下嗎？=I'll be finished soon.\nWould you mind waiting a little?
剛才是電視採訪嗎？\n好厲害……像是藝人一樣！=Was that an interview? Wow! It's like you're a celebrity or something!
怎麼，{{A}}大人，\n居然還兼職當模特啊。=Is Disciplinary Committee-sama moonlighting as a model?
不，這只是給家裡的生意幫個忙。\n宣傳一下家裡的店鋪。=No, I'm simply helping the family business. \nThat was an ad for our shop.
可能就是在有線電視的傍晚新聞上，\n露個臉的程度而已。=It will only make a brief appearance on the evening news.
……生意？你家是幹嘛的啊？=...Family business? What kind of business?
{{C}}，{{A}}你不知道嗎？\n{{D}}的父親，是{{B}}的社長哦。=Oh, you don't know, {{A}}? Her father's the president of {{B}}.
就是那家……賣梅乾和鹹菜的？\n在電視上播一堆廣告的那家公司！？=As in UMETANE umeboshi and pickles!? \nThe ones in all those commercials on TV!?
你原來不知道啊？=You didn't know?
原來那麼有名啊=<size\=30>Is it really that famous?</size>
啊，我當然知道她是個大小姐，\n但哪知道她是{{A}}家的……=Nah. I knew she was some kinda heiress, but I had no idea it was to {{A}}...
你們家的梅乾……很棒！=I'm a huge fan of your umeboshi!
喔，看來是老客人嗎？\n謝謝你一直以來的支持。=Oh, so you're a regular of ours?\nThank you so much for your patronage.
{{B}}，{{A}}這態度轉換也太快了，\n笑死我了。=It's pretty funny watching {{A}} turn on a dime like that.
哪有！只是湯底的秘制配料裡我有時會用到，\n因為她家的梅子…品質真的很好。=Lay off! It's a secret ingredient in my broth. Their stuff is super high quality.
對啊……{{A}}的梅乾，\n說真的，品質比別家好太多了。=Course it is. They make the best umeboshi out there!
我還會用來做湯底的秘制配料什麼的，\n反正她家的梅乾不能缺……=I use it as a secret ingredient in my broth, so you could say I owe a lot to UMETANE.
……不客氣。=...No prob.
{{B}}，重點是，這身衣服真的好可愛啊～\n太太太適合{{A}}了！=By the way, your outfit is really cute, {{A}}～ It looks amazing on you!
的確很適合你=It really does
人靠衣裝馬靠鞍啊=<size\=23>Anyone could pull off that outfit</size>
是嗎？謝謝。=You think so? Thank you.
{{A}}，謝謝，\n就算是客套話我也很高興。={{A}}, thank you. I appreciate that, even if it's just flattery.
r:"^(.*)，喂，你在說什麼呀！\n(.*)他、他其實是想說～！！$"="Wha—!? How can you say that!"
特別……適合{{A}}！特別漂亮的意思吧！？\n人靠衣裝馬……什麼來著，我其實沒太明白！=It looks amazing! She's beautiful! "Anyone could pull it off." What are you even saying?
{{B}}，{{A}}你呀，\n不過現在的我……或許正像他說的那樣呢。={{B}}, thanks, {{A}}.\nBut I think he might be right.
唔，穿成這樣去咖啡廳的話，\n不太合適。=Anyway, I can't go to the café dressed like this, can I?
我換身衣服就來，\n你們先去店裡等我吧。=Please go ahead and wait for me there. I'll come meet you as soon as I've finished changing.
我拜託你們過來，\n還讓等這麼久，真不好意思。=Sorry to keep you all waiting after inviting you out.
沒事沒事！\n剛才的採訪什麼時候會播呀？我會看的！=No, it's no problem at all! But when will you be on TV!? I'll be sure to watch!
{{A}}，梅乾才是主角哦，\n應該不會有什麼我的鏡頭呢。={{A}}, the umeboshi is the star of the show, so I doubt you will see all that much of me.
那，回到正題吧……=Anyway, back to the topic at hand...
是說，你也想調查{{A}}的事對吧？=You wanna look into {{A}}, right?
上次我就問過你……你當時就在現場吧，\n{{A}}那時候真的動手了嗎？=You did actually see it go down, right? Did {{A}} really attack him?
……嗯，就從這裡說起吧，\n我會告訴大家我所看到的全部經過。=...I guess that's a good place to start from. I'll tell you everything I saw.
聽下來…… 怎麼感覺是{{B}}，\n故意激怒{{A}}動的手……=It sounds like {{B}} was purposely trying to provoke {{A}}...
還有，目擊者偏偏是那個二人組啊。\n是不是也太巧了？=The two students who gave her trouble before  just happened to be there to witness it? Way too convenient, if you ask me.
嗯，雖然我在描述事情經過時，\n難免會代入些主觀想法……=Well, since you're only hearing my side of the story it may be a little subjective, but...
不過現在看來，「各種巧合的疊加」，\n在這一點上，你們也有疑問。=It seems like you've all come to the same conclusion I did. There are too many of these "coincidences" to overlook.
我先說前提，{{A}}，\n她被禁止在課外時間與學生接觸。=First of all, {{A}} was told not to make contact with students outside of class.
啊……我記得{{A}}好像說過類似的話……=Oh, now that you mention it, {{A}} did say something like that to her.
嗯，但是{{A}}對那些在乎的學生，\n還是會忍不住去關心。=But it seems that {{A}} continued reaching out to students she was concerned about.
啊……{{A}}就是這樣，\n只要學生遇到問題她就不會不管。=Well, when she's worried about her students, she can't just throw 'em to the lions. She's not that kinda person.
沒錯，\n但假如正因為這點「被反將一軍」呢？=You're right. But what if someone decided to use that against her?
反將一軍……？=Used against her?
是被利用了嗎=<size\=29>She's being manipulated?</size>
……嗯，就是這樣。=...Yes, that's right.
{{B}}一直守在{{A}}周圍，適時出面，\n干擾她的行動，{{C}}心裡應該有不少怨氣。={{B}}'s been following {{A}} and interfering at every turn. It's been a source of frustration for her.
這種情況應該發生過幾次了……\n{{A}}應該有印象吧？=Apparently it's been happening frequently... You witnessed a similar incident yourself, didn't you, {{A}}?
說起來……我們在天臺和{{B}}說話的時候，\n{{A}}中途出現打斷了我們。=Yeah... {{A}} interrupted us when we were talking to Katayama-san on the roof.
啊！我也記得這個！\n當時還在想為什麼{{A}}會在那兒呢……！=Oh yeah! I remember that! I was wondering what {{A}} was doing there!
啊！我也記得這個！\n當時還在想為什麼{{A}}會在那裡呢……！=Oh yeah! I remember that! I was wondering what {{A}} was doing there!
而且，{{B}}被當成{{A}}之後，\n她的情緒也變得更加不穩定了。=And now that she's being treated like a {{A}}, {{B}} seems to be in an emotionally vulnerable state.
再就是出於……責任感吧。\n課外禁止她接觸學生……情緒再次被激化……=Then there's her sense of responsibility to the students. Not being allowed to interact with them is making matters worse...
於是演變成現在隨時都可能爆發的狀態，\n那種狀態下的{{A}}，正想跟我談談……=She could explode at any time. That's the state {{A}} was in when she came to talk to me that day...
就是說，{{A}}清楚{{B}}當時的狀態……？=And you're saying {{A}},\nknowing all of that...
嗯，他當時就在附近，先聯絡上{{A}}、\n再是那兩個女生，之後找機會現身打斷談話。=Yes. He confronted her after having arranged for the {{A}} and those two girls to witness everything.
這種可能性應該是存在的。=Maybe it sounds too contrived to believe.
{{A}}……聽下來真的是……=Well... Now that you mention it...
還有一點讓我懷疑{{A}}的理由，\n就是他的「智慧眼鏡」。=I have another reason to doubt {{A}}. His smart glasses.
嗯？啊，就是那個老土的眼鏡吧。=His what? Oh, you mean those lame specs he wears?
嗯，恐怕{{A}}，\n從「進入房間那一刻」就開始錄影了。=Yes. I think {{A}} was recording from the second he entered the room.
因為他確信，\n{{A}}會對他動手……=He was convinced he could make {{A}} turn violent on him, so...
那……意思是……！=So that means...!
{{A}}被算計了？=He set her up?
一切都是{{A}}的計畫？=<size\=28>{{A}} planned all of this?</size>
……還，不能確定。=...It's still too early to say.
目前這都還是我個人的推測，\n只是……我覺得很可疑。=It may just be speculation on my part, but I believe there's good reason to be suspicious of him.
我在網上試著查了一下{{A}}的事，\n此前他應該是在企業擔任顧問工作。=I did a little research on {{A}}. It seems he used to work as a business consultant.
在{{A}}的幫助下，無論什麼樣的企業，\n都得以改善現有問題，業績也有顯著的提升。=With his help, all of his client companies improved and achieved great success.
對這位優秀的顧問，\n相關人士的態度幾乎都是稱讚和感謝……=Most comments about him online praise his skill as a consultant...
不過在匿名論壇上，\n也有一些讓人在意的評論。=But I found some more interesting posts on anonymous message boards.
這裡寫了……=This...
{{A}}提出的方針，凡是反對的人，\n立刻就會被負面輿論包圍，最後被迫辭職……="After I disagreed with his methods, my reputation at work took a huge hit, and I was forced to resign."
還有被{{A}}找出證據坐實不法行為的社員，\n儘管一直聲稱是冤枉的，最終還是自殺了……=There's another account of an employee who {{A}} falsely accused of fraud. During the litigation, they committed suicide...
自殺……！？=Suicide...!?
等一下……要是這些都是真的，\n那這人不是很可怕嗎！=Wait... If this is all true, we've got a very dangerous person on our hands!
別著急，這只是網路上的投稿，\n是真是假並沒有定論，不過……=Stay calm. They are just internet posts, so there's no way to know if they're real. That said...
他主張推行的所謂「工作方式改革」，\n使{{A}}畏手畏腳，學生也對{{A}}變得不信任。=The "work reform" he's been pushing demoralizes the teachers and makes students\nless trusting of them.
至少，我個人不覺得他是個好心的顧問。=At the very least, I can't see that his work as a consultant was done with the best intentions in mind.
相反，看起來他只是想強行解決問題，\n營造出「只有」顧問{{A}}成功可靠的樣子……=Rather, he solves problems by force so that he alone is in a position to succeed...
{{A}}……我就知道……！\n打從一開始我就覺得那人不對勁！=I knew it! \nI didn't trust that guy from the start!
{{A}}是被陷害的是吧！？\n混蛋，{{B}}這個混蛋……！=So he really set {{A}} up!?\nDamn that bastard!
啊……不是聽說他把人逼上絕路了嗎……\n那{{A}}，是不是也可能……？=And these rumors of people dying... Could that be what's in store for her too...?
{{A}}，我要怎麼做才好？\n現在還有什麼需要調查的！？={{A}}, what can we do about this!? What else should we investigate!?
r:"^慢著慢著慢著！(.*)，你太衝動了！\n(.*)，先讓他冷靜下來。$"="Hold on, $1! Don't be so rash! $2, talk some sense into him!"
你們阿，未免過於相信{{A}}了吧。\n如果她跟{{B}}一夥呢？或者她是幕後黑手呢？=You're all far too quick to trust {{A}}. What if she's secretly on {{B}}'s side!?
貓頭、鷹……？=Did that owl just...?
……不，是錯覺嗎……？=No... Maybe I'm hearing things...
r:"^首先，要弄清楚她為何幫忙調查(.*)，(.*)。$"="We should figure out why she wants to help with our investigation first, $2."
為什麼要找我們商量？=<size\=28>Why discuss this with us?</size>
你的目的是什麼？=What's your goal here?
為什麼……啊。="Why?"
因為你們也跟我一樣，\n相信{{A}}，懷疑{{B}}吧。=Because I felt that you also believed in {{A}} and were suspicious of {{B}}.
我目前能提供的情報就是這些了，\n你們那邊有什麼線索嗎？=Anyway, that's all the information I have to give. Do you all know anything?
目的……嗯。=My goal? Well...
我只是想知道{{A}}到底想幹什麼，\n所以才找上同樣對他存有疑心的你們。=I just want to know what {{A}} is up to. I reached out to you because you're suspicious of him too.
我目前能提供的情報就是這些了。\n你們那邊有什麼線索嗎？=Anyway, that's all the information I have to give. Do you all know anything?
我們這邊也很懵……\n完全不知道接下來怎麼辦……=We don't have a clue...
那，之後你們能否幫我打聽些情報呢？=If that's the case, would you help me obtain more information?
我們聯手調查這件事，\n然後同步各自獲得的情報……怎麼樣？=We can investigate together and share the information we find. What do you think?
原來如此，同樣懷疑{{A}}之人的聯手請求……\n也算是「交易」了吧。=So she's suggesting an alliance of those suspicious of {{A}}... A deal of sorts.
r:"^這個提議很公平且對雙方都有利，交涉的話，\n姑且也算值得信賴，(.*)覺得呢？$"="It benefits both sides, and seems credible enough. What should we do, $1?"
接受吧=We accept
也沒其他辦法了=<size\=28>We have no other options</size>
……那就這麼定了，謝謝。=...It's settled then. Thank you.
我們才該道謝呢！\n{{A}}在的話，感覺讓人好安心啊！=No, thank you! It's really reassuring to have you on our side, {{A}}!
決定跟{{A}}聯手了……=We've agreed to start working with {{A}}...
就{{A}}了，{{C}}，\n{{B}}……我之前說話有點衝，我道歉……=We're counting on you, {{C}}. Sorry for being a bit confrontational at first...
沒關係，我們也只是相差一年，\n如果可以，希望你們說話也可以隨意些。=It's okay. And seeing as we're all only a year apart, please feel free to speak to me more casually.
啊……不過接下來，\n要怎麼調查{{A}}的事呢？=So... How are we gonna get the dirt on {{A}}?
關於這點我有個想法，\n可能有些複雜……大家可以聽我說明一下嗎？=I have an idea, but it will take a bit of explaining. Will you hear me out?

Chapter 3 Part 1 Day 8
----------
打擾啦～請問{{A}}在嗎～？=Excuse meeee～ Is {{A}} here～?
你是之前和{{B}}有過糾紛的學生吧……\n名字是，{{A}}嗎？=You're the student who had a disagreement with {{B}}. {{A}}, was it?
啊，{{A}}，那時幸虧有{{B}}您在～\n太感謝了～！=Ahaha, thanks for coming to my rescue～!
喔？我以為你是站在{{A}}那邊的呢……=Oh?\nBut I thought you were on her side...
不不！\n我之前也不知道她是個那麼差勁的{{A}}！=No way! That was before I found out how violent she is!
我其實今天……是來找{{A}}的，\n您說過希望聽取大家對學園的改善建議對吧？=Anyways... I have some ideas to improve the school if you don't mind listening.
嗯，當然。\n你要是有什麼建議儘管向我說明。=Yes, of course. I always have time for students' requests.
太好了！那我就說了……=Yay! Then I'll cut right to the chase...
我希望能增加學校小賣部的麵包種類！\n因為、現在甜的麵包太少了！=I want more pastries in the school store! The selection of sweets is really lacking!
對了，學園活動的建議可以提嗎？\n我想舉辦棒球大賽～！=Oh, I also had an idea for a school event! I would looove if we could hold a baseball tournament～!
請、請等一下{{A}}，如果建議比較多，\n我可以另外空出時間來溝通……=J-Just a moment, {{A}}. It seems this may become a lengthy discussion, so I'll need to set aside time to talk another day.
……{{A}}不如一邊休息，\n一邊聽取這位同學的建議吧？=...Perhaps you could take a break now to discuss with her?
{{A}}工作這麼久也該累了吧？\n整理資料的話我來做就好。=You must be getting exhausted of all this desk work, {{A}}. I'll finish organizing the data for you.
啊，那我們去天臺吧，{{A}}！\n在那吹吹風會很舒服哦！=Awesome! Let's go talk on the roof, {{A}}! The breeze up there is great!
說的也是，那我就恭敬不如從命，\n稍微休息一會兒吧。=Very well. If you insist. \nI'll step out for a moment to talk.
說的也是，那我就恭敬不如從命，\n稍微休息一下吧。=Very well. If you insist. \nI'll step out for a moment to talk.
那我們走吧，{{A}}快來！=Let's go! Come on!
好的好的，等等我。=All right, all right. I'm coming.
……果然沒把這個帶上。=...As I expected, he left them behind.
和學生接觸時，或許是想多一些親近感，\n會特意換上那副淺色的眼鏡……=He often changes to his tinted glasses when he's in front of students. Maybe it's to look more relatable?
……我說，剛才{{A}}演得也太像了吧？\n根本不像是在演的啊。=...Man, {{A}} really knows how to sell it. That act was flawless.
{{A}}從小就很有膽量呢，\n雖然事前和她對過劇本……=I always thought {{A}} had nerves of steel ever since we were kids. I gave her a script to work with for today, but...
不過現場的發揮確實超出想像，\n說不定她很適合登臺表演呢。=She really outdid herself. \nI bet she could have a future in theater.
那，就拜託你們替我把風了。=Anyway, keep a lookout while I search.
看來想要僥倖找出密碼還是太天真了，\n至少能發現什麼線索也好……=He's probably not careless enough to write down his password. Maybe something can give me a hint...
郵件……電子相冊……=Messages... Photos...
還是不對，那就試試這個……=That's not it. Maybe this'll work...
喂，還沒好嗎？\n搞不好他馬上就回來了！=Hey, you almost done?\nThey'll be back any minute!
放心，已經縮小範圍了，\n這次應該就能……=Don't worry. I think I've figured it out...
……猜對了。=...Bingo.
啊，這麼快！\n你怎麼猜到的！？=Whoa, for real!?\nHow'd you do that!?
稍後我會解釋的，\n我先解決眼前的問題。=I'll explain later. This takes priority.
隱藏資料夾……\n裡面有照片和影片……嗯？這是……=There's a hidden folder here filled with image and video files... Huh? This is...
果然……=I knew it...
找到什麼了？=Found something?
找到了決定性證據了？=Is there proof in there?
……嗯，多虧{{A}}和你們幫忙。=...Yes, we've got it.\nAll thanks to you three.
……我先全部複製出來，\n再看看還有什麼能用得上的……=...Now to copy everything.\nIs there anything else of note?
{{A}}要回來了嗎？\n嗯，你們倆快出去吧。={{A}} is on her way back? Got it.\nYou two should get out of here quickly.
之後還在{{A}}那家咖啡廳碰面。=Let's reconvene at the café in {{A}} later.
好，那{{A}}你也小心。=Gotcha.\nBe careful, {{A}}.

不好意思又讓你們這麼遠跑一趟，\n我想這種討論，還是離學校遠些比較好。=I'm sorry to make you come all this way again. I thought it best if we met somewhere far from school.
今天我請客，你們想吃什麼，\n儘管點就好。=Today is my treat, so order whatever you'd like.
{{A}}，不行不行！那不合適！=What!? No, that's waaaay too generous!
多虧了你們，我才能確認{{A}}的電腦。\n至少讓我表達一下謝意。=Without all of you, I couldn't have hacked {{A}}'s PC. It's the least I can do.
{{B}}，尤其是{{A}}，\n你完美的演技可是功勞不小。={{B}}, {{A}}'s performance particularly\nstole the show.
的確很精彩=That's fantastic
我就做不到=<size\=28>I could never pull that off</size>
沒有啦，\n是{{A}}劇本的功勞啦～=I can't take all the credit. {{A}} wrote the script for me～
而且增加麵包種類和棒球大賽的想法，\n那可不是演技，我是真這麼想的！=Besides, I was totally serious about the pastries and baseball tournament!
{{A}}……原來是真心話啊……\n怪不得……=Oh, so it wasn't just an act...\nThat explains it.
那也很厲害了，\n演的讓人絲毫沒有起疑心呢。=Still, it was very impressive. \nNo one would have doubted you for a second.
那，{{A}}你想點什麼？=So, what would you like to eat, {{A}}?
我就不客氣了！\n我想想……=Well, I guess I'll order my fill then!\nLet's see...
好了，我們說正事吧，\n關於{{A}}電腦裡的內容……=So, in regard to {{A}}'s PC...
雖然我還沒來得及仔細檢查所有內容，\n但裡面，有很多{{A}}的照片和影片。=I didn't have time to examine everything, but I found several photos and videos of {{A}}.
……而且特意單獨放在了專用的資料夾裡。=...All compiled in their own special folder.
{{A}}，難道他是……=What, that's...
難道是、跟蹤狂？=Is he a stalker?
死忠粉？=<size\=29>Is he obsessed with her?</size>
不是，\n他應該是在……尋找別人的弱點。=No. If anything,\nI think he's trying to find her weakness.
證據就是那兩個女生拍的影片，\n也在{{A}}的電腦裡有備份。=Case in point, he had copies of the footage taken by those two students stored on his PC.
……等等，\n{{A}}不是說他把影片刪除了嗎？=...Wait, didn't {{A}} say he deleted that?
嗯，跟{{A}}是這樣說的……\n但實際上，他撒謊了。=Yes. He told the {{A}} as much... but it turns out that was a lie.
那，把{{B}}的影片，\n投稿到{{A}}上的人也是……！=So the one who posted {{B}} to {{A}} was...!
因為是匿名投稿，所以無法確定，\n但是我認為很有可能就是他。=I can't say for certain since the post was anonymous, but it's highly plausible.
我還沒有看完所有的資料，\n等我全部確認後再和你們說，可以嗎？=I haven't reviewed all the data yet, but I can contact you once I'm finished.
沒問題，當然可以！\n謝謝{{A}}。=Yes, please! Thank you so much.
對了，你們幾個，\n記得問一下{{A}}電腦的開機密碼。=Wait. You should inquire about the password to {{A}}'s PC.
{{A}}那扇鎖住的門，\n說不定這個密碼是開啟的關鍵所在。=It could be the key to unlocking that door in the {{A}}.
喔，對啊。=Oh, good thinkin'!
{{B}}，{{A}}的電腦密碼是什麼？\n你是怎麼猜到的？=By the way, {{B}}, what was {{A}}'s password? How'd you figure it out?
唔，密碼是他過去的員工編號。=Oh right. It was his old employee ID number.
在擔任顧問以前，\n{{A}}似乎有在電視臺工作的經歷。=Before {{A}} became a consultant, apparently he worked at a TV station.
電視臺！？\n好厲害……這就是那種精英人士吧……=A TV station!?\nWow, that guy really is a big shot...
他那個時期的照片，\n智慧眼鏡的相冊裡保存了很多。=The album in his smart glasses had a lot of photos from that time.
他特意拍下了自己工作證的近照，\n這可能是他很珍貴的一段回憶……=His employee ID was the only close-up,\nso I thought it must be important...
所以我就當成密碼試著輸了進去，\n儘管我也有其他的備選，結果真就猜對了……=It was worth a try, and I was right. Of course, I had several other guesses in mind.
想的也太細了吧……\n要是我的話可能怎麼想都想不到這種角度。=You're real sharp. If I had to figure that out, I'd be screwed.
啊，可以把密碼也告訴我們一下嗎？=So, um, could you tell us the number?
可以是可以……不過你們為什麼想知道？=I suppose so... but why?
啊，那個，{{A}}，我們這邊可能、\n也需要再去調查之類的……=Uh, well, you know, it'll be helpful if we want to investigate more and stuff.
……好的，告訴你們沒什麼問題，\n但你們要向我保證不能濫用哦？=...Since it's you three, I don't mind. But do you promise not to misuse it?
……好的，告訴你們沒什麼問題，\n但你們要向我保證不能濫用哦！=...Since it's you three, I don't mind. But do you promise not to misuse it?
我我我、我保證=Uhhh, sure...
嗯……好吧。=Hm... All right.
有紙筆嗎？=Do you have something to write with?
……真的能保證嗎……=On second thought...
當、當然沒問題！\n今天他，那個……有點感冒……對吧？=W-We'll definitely behave! He's just uhhh, sleepy! Yeah, sleepy. Isn't that right...?
啊，稍等，記事本，記事本……=Oh, yeah! Just a sec!\nNotebook, notebook...
很好，拿到了{{A}}的密碼，\n這麼一來，或許就能解除那個門鎖了。=Now that we've obtained {{A}}'s password, I'm confident we can get through that lock.
太好了，那我們趕緊去{{A}}！=Great!\nLet's head to the {{A}} right now!
那等下就直接去{{A}}吧。=Next stop, {{A}}.
久等了。=Hey, I'm back.
啊，{{A}}，多謝款待！=Oh! Thanks for the meal, {{A}}!
多謝款待。=Thank you.
不客氣，你們三個、接下來要去做什麼嗎？=You're very welcome.\nSo, where are you all headed?
啊，那個，唔……我還有作業要寫，\n這就回家啦～！=Oh, um, right. I've got homework and stuff,\nso I should hurry back home～!
我也……是，直接回家睡覺去。=Yeah, I'm gonna head back and hit the hay.
我也回家=I'm going home too
可能會繞個道=<size\=30>I might stop somewhere</size>
……好啊，那就在這分開吧，\n大家路上注意安全哦。=...I see. Take care then.\nBe careful on your way home.
好，{{A}}明天學校見！=Will do! See you at school, {{A}}!
真的多謝了！=Thanks a bunch!
……錯不了，\n他們……從上次起就有事瞞著我……=They're definitely up to something...
好像聽他們說……去「{{A}}」，\n那是什麼意思呢……？而且……=What does "heading to the Palace" mean? Also...
提出問密碼要求的、那個聲音……\n應該不是他們３個的聲音吧……？=The voice that asked for the password...\nIt didn't belong to any of them.
行了，我們趕緊去{{A}}吧！=All right, let's get to the {{A}}!
<color\=#ff0000>唔，不過這次應該會是持久戰。\n需要做好充足的準備。</color>=<color\=#ff0000>Right. However, this visit may be especially challenging. We'd best prepare accordingly.</color>
<color\=#ff0000>要不要買點什麼就交給隊長判斷啦！\n我們就在這裡等你。</color>=<color\=#ff0000>You can take care of the shopping, Leader! We'll wait right here for you!</color>
還想買東西=Not yet
好，那我們就出發吧！=Yeah, let's roll!
嗯，我們就在這裡等你\n準備好了叫我們就好哦！=Okay, we'll wait here then. \nGive us a shout when you're ready!

Chapter 3 Part 1 Palace Part 2

不是說回家嗎……\n他們到底在做什麼……？=They said they were going home... \nWhat are they doing?
不見了……！？=They vanished...!?
剛才，明明就在這裡……！=But they were here just a sec—!
這個是{{A}}的筆記本吧……\n那，他們剛才肯定是在這裡的……=This notebook... \nSo, they definitely were here.
到底是怎麼回事……？\n先給{{A}}打個電話吧……=What is going on? Let me try {{A}}...
這是什麼，這個圖示……=What's this icon...?
唔，這裡、是什麼地方……！=Wh-Where am I...!?
剛才發生了什麼……？=How did I...?
那麼，再確認一下吾等的目的。=Okay, let's review our objective.
前往第３區域的{{A}}，\n抵達那扇被密碼鎖住的門前，沒問題吧？=We'll head to the third area and go back to that password protected door in {{A}}. Understood?
沒問題！=Roger that!
CATTLE，那就拜託你了！=Cattle, do your thing!
那個……是什麼……？=What... just happened?
完全……沒有思路……\n是什麼東西……變成了車嗎？他們怎麼……=What did I just see? Some... something, transformed into a car, and those three...
那，就試著輸一下那個密碼吧，\n記事本在SOY那兒吧？=Right, let's enter that password. \nGot your notebook, Soy?
那，就試著輸一下那個密碼吧，\n記事本在SOY那裡吧？=Right, let's enter that password. \nGot your notebook, Soy?
對，稍等。=Yeah, one sec.
……嗯？啊？我放哪兒了？=...Hm? That's weird. Where is it?
……嗯？啊？我放哪裡了？=...Hm? That's weird. Where is it?
{{A}}？什麼啊？不會吧，怎麼沒了！=Huh? Ah! No freakin' way! It's gone!?
{{A}}～不是吧！你弄丟了啊！？=What!? You're kidding me! Did you drop it!?
落車裡了……？\n不好意思CATTLE，你再變成車一下。=Maybe it's in the car... Sorry, Cattle. I need you to transform again.
唔？不會吧，如果有異物在吾體內，\n吾肯定能察覺的……罷了。=Hm? If something were inside me, I think I would know... But if you insist.
呵啊！呵{{A}}！好、好癢！\n那種地方才沒掉什麼東西呢！=Hooaha! Hooahahaha! Th-That tickles! There is nothing down there, I swear it!
奇怪，如果記事本掉了出來，\n那只能是在車裡啊……=What the heck? If I dropped it, it should be around here...
呵啊……！\n那裡是吾敏感的地方，別拽啊！=Hooaaah! Do not pull that! \nI'm sensitive there!
夠了！別再找了！\n是不是落在現實世界哪裡了啊！？=Hey! That is quite enough! Did you lose it in the real world, perchance!?
再就是……那現在，\n誰還記得{{A}}的密碼嗎！=Anyway, does no one remember {{A}}'s password!?
{{A}}，這話我說有點那個、畢竟本子是我拿的，\n我其實瞄了一眼，最開頭應該是……９？=No. I had it in my notebook, so I only glanced at the number. I think it started with a 9 maybe?
{{A}}，不是８嗎？\n我只記得，那個密碼還挺長的……=Huh? I thought it was an 8? I remember it being kind of long...
好像是６……=I feel like it was 6...
感覺開頭是７=My money's on 7
這就沒個靠譜的人啊！=None of you have the faintest idea, do you!?
那CATTLE你記得嗎？=You don't remember it either, Cattle?
吾不是根本就沒有機會看記事本嘛！\n吾只能一直躲在WONDER的包裡啊！=If you recall, I didn't get to see the number! I was inside Wonder's bag!
{{A}}，對不起……你別生氣了。=Okay okay, I'm sorry... Don't be mad.
吾的身體剛才可都被你摸遍了！\n不生氣怎麼可能啊！=You just riffled through my insides looking for that password! I'm livid!
嘎啊～～！=SKREEEE～～!
{{A}}……你在幹嘛？=Uh... What are you doing?
吾這是在威嚇！\n在表達吾現在氣得渾身哆嗦！=That was a warning screech! It means I'm furious with you!
渾身……哆嗦……=Furious...
怎麼看這個姿勢都是在賣萌啊……=It just looked like a cute pose to me...
可是，弄丟了也沒辦法吧，\n回到現實再去問一下{{A}}吧……=Well, if it's lost, it's lost. We'll just have to go back to the real world and ask {{A}} again...
沒那個必要。=That won't be necessary.
我就在這，而且也記得密碼。=I'm here. And I know the passcode.
啊，等等……啊！？=Wha— How— Huh!?
為什麼你會在這……！=Why are you here...!
為啥你會在這！？=How are you here!?
r:"^……雖然遮住了臉，你是(.*)同學吧，旁邊的是(.*)和(.*)，對吧？$"="...Even with those masks, I can tell you're $1-kun, $2, and $3."
r:"^至於戴著奇怪兜帽的這位，那個聲音是你吧？\n那個從(.*)同學包裡發出的聲音。$"="And you there, in the strange hood. I heard your voice coming from $1-kun's bag, didn't I?"
沒想到……你，已經能聽到吾的聲音了嗎。=My word! You could hear me all along?
你可以叫吾CATTLE，\n不過這只是在{{A}}的行動代號。=Please call me Cattle. That is my {{A}} code name.
{{B}}嗎……好的，{{A}}。\n大家也都有這樣的別名嗎？={{B}}... It's nice to meet you. Does everyone else have code names too?
這裡叫我WONDER=My name is Wonder
{{B}}，現在不是做自我介紹的時候吧！\n為什麼{{C}}會出現在{{A}}啊？=Hey, this is no time for introductions! {{C}}, why are you in the {{A}}?
{{A}}……唔，這裡，是{{A}}啊。\n沒想到會有這種地方存在。=The {{A}}? I see. So this place is a universe separate from our own? I can't believe something like this exists.
但為什麼我會來這……\n這一點我也還不明白。=As to why I'm here... I haven't a clue either.
我先看到你們在{{A}}的站前廣場消失了，\n然後點了下某個奇怪的手機軟體，就到這了。=I saw you vanish at {{A}} Station, then I opened an odd app on my phone and found myself here.
奇怪的手機軟體……\n{{B}}的手機裡，也有{{A}}？=An odd app? So the {{A}} was on your phone too?
嗯，你指的是那個詭異的蛇形圖示吧。=The app icon was an eerie looking snake.
原來如此……那，應該就沒錯了。=I see... Then there's no mistaking it.
{{A}}，怎麼覺得你一點都不意外啊，\n而且從入口到這兒的路應該不短吧……？=This might be a stupid question, but aren't we really far from the entrance right now?
{{A}}，怎麼覺得你一點都不意外啊，\n而且從入口到這裡的路應該不短吧……？=This might be a stupid question, but aren't we really far from the entrance right now?
你就一個人這麼過來了……！？=How the heck did you get all this way by yourself...!?
{{A}}……！那陰影、哎呀，\n{{B}}沒被什麼怪物襲擊嗎！？=Oh yeah! You weren't attacked by Shadows, uh... I mean, monsters, were you!?
陰影？不太明白你在說什麼，\n但是我應該沒遇到什麼阻礙就到這裡了。=Shadows? I don't know what those are, but I didn't run into any trouble.
那個孩子帶我過來的……在那。=I had this one to guide me.
哇，那是什麼！？=Wha—!? What is that!?
……我不知道它的身份，\n但我是按照它指示的路線來這兒的。=...I'm not sure, but I just followed where it led me.
……我不知道它的身份，\n但我是按照它指示的路線來這裡的。=...I'm not sure, but I just followed where it led me.
當時的情況我也沒有其他辦法，\n啊，難道它是你們的同伴嗎？=There was no other clear path to follow after all. Oh, is it an ally of yours?
不不，我們不認識啊！=No no! We've never seen that thing before!
如果說是陰影，卻絲毫感覺不到敵意……\n換個角度考慮的話，倒更像是……=For a Shadow I'm not sensing much hostility from it. In fact, it's more like...
稍等，有什麼東西……靠近了。=Wait... Something is coming.
敵意……危險……類似這樣的存在正在靠近，\n似乎它正要告訴我……=I think my guide is trying to warn us of some hostile danger approaching...
確實……有一股敵意正在接近！\n真是出乎意料，居然能先吾一步發現……！=Yes... I sense a malicious presence as well! How could it detect that earlier than I...!?
喂，你們說的敵意是什麼啊！？=Hey, hang on! What malicious presence are we talkin' about!?
應該是……\n上次出現過的那個{{A}}的認知存在。=Most likely that cognitive form of {{A}}.
{{A}}還在這，\n不能把她捲入戰鬥……！=With {{A}} here, we can't allow ourselves to get caught up in a battle...!
優先選擇逃走吧？這裡就一條路，\n那麼只有打開門向前走了。=So retreating is our best option, isn't it? It seems our only path is through that door.
可、哎呀，但那樣的話……！=Um, no that's...!
前方有什麼危險尚未可知，\n吾等不能就這麼帶你走。=Unknown peril lies beyond those doors.\nWe can't take you with us.
現在能回現實世界的話就好了……！=I'd prefer to escort you back to reality, but...!
留在原地必然有危險，向前走只是有機率，\n那麼答案很明瞭了……我們繼續向前吧？=There is certain danger here, and the possibility of danger ahead. In that case, shouldn't we proceed forward?
門上的這個數位鍵盤，\n只要輸入{{A}}的密碼就行了吧。=We just need to input {{A}}'s password into this keypad, right?
對，但寫著密碼的記事本，我弄丟了……！=Yeah, but I dropped my notebook that had the password in it!
門開了……=The door opened...
太強了吧……=Amazing...
這個聲音，\n是那個像{{A}}的陰影發出來的！=That's the sound of the Akashi-looking Shadow thing!
怎麼辦，WONDER？=What do we do, Wonder?
朝前走吧=We're pressing on
只能繼續前進了=No way out but through
沒辦法了，只能繼續前進了！=We've no choice! Hurry through the door!
回去會遇到那個貌似{{A}}的認知存在，\n現在只能前進了，WONDER！=If we go back, we'll run into {{A}}'s cognitive form. We have to press ahead, Wonder!
……好了，這樣門應該又鎖上了。=...All right. It should be locked again now.
{{A}}的認知存在？={{A}}'s Cognitive Being?
喔，門是鎖著的呢，\n怎麼感覺剛才這附近有異物的氣息……=Oh? It's still locked. I could've sworn I sensed an invader prowling around...
不過，像那天闖進來的那群笨蛋，\n是不敢再來了吧，{{A}}……=But those foolish intruders from the other day wouldn't dare return. Heheh...
好像……走遠了。=I think it's gone...
看來眼前的危險已經過去了，\n能請你們解釋一下這是什麼地方了嗎？=Now that there's no immediate threat, \ncould you explain this place to me?
{{A}}……該從哪兒說起呢……=Right... Where do we even start?
{{A}}……該從哪裡說起呢……=Right... Where do we even start?
原來是這樣……人類集體無意識的{{A}}，\n那這個像水壩一樣的建築……=So the "{{A}}" embodies the collective unconscious of humankind. And this dam facility...
就是{{A}}的內心……\n由她扭曲的慾望所創造的世界……對吧。=Was created by the twisted desires in {{A}}'s heart. Is that correct?
你這什麼理解力啊！=Damn, you caught on fast...!
不愧是{{A}}……\n跟我們的大腦構造完全不同啊……={{A}}'s on a whole other playing field than us...
另外，在這個{{A}}的內心世界中，\n{{B}}不知道為什麼竟然在「保護」這裡。=And this world representing {{A}}'s heart is, for some reason, protected by {{B}}.
所以，你們才會去調查{{A}}。=That's why you were looking into them.
沒錯。\n話說回來，你竟然都理解到這個地步了……=Precisely. You are truly quite astute...
{{C}}，\n這個{{B}}真的是{{A}}的嗎？={{C}}, are you certain this is {{A}}'s {{B}}?
直呼吾CATTLE就好，如你所說，\n吾是用{{A}}之名追蹤心聲，才找到這個{{B}}。=Just Cattle is fine. And yes. We were led here by the collective unconscious using her name.
所以這裡必然是{{A}}。\n至於{{B}}的認知存在……確實很不可思議。=Hence, this is surely {{A}}. Yet, the presence of {{B}} remains an enigma.
……是很奇怪，現實中的{{A}}，\n怎麼看都不像是會依賴{{B}}。=...Yes, it is odd. I can't imagine the real {{A}} depending on {{B}} in any way.
反而能感受到的是{{A}}對他的敵意。=In fact, she seems hostile toward him.
對吧？\n我就是覺得怎麼都……說不通啊。=Right? It's real weird.
但是，剛才那扇門，\n卻是用{{A}}的密碼打開的……=But {{A}}'s password opened the door just now...
上在心裡的鎖，\n竟然用別人的密碼才能打開……=Why would they make someone else's password the key to their heart?
說明在很大程度上信賴那個人，\n或者說是依存於那個人……=That would imply a deep trust between them. Or perhaps, dependency...?
又或者……是被那個人利用了。=Or maybe... she's being exploited?
利用？=Exploited?
首先……{{A}}，\n不可能知道{{B}}的密碼。=Circling back, there's no reason {{A}} could ever know {{B}}'s password in the first place.
對啊……\n除非他們兩個是戀人之類的……=True... I mean, unless they're actually a couple or something...
不可能！怎麼可能是戀人啊！=No way! Not in a million years!
如果不是戀人，那扇上鎖的門，\n用{{A}}個人的密碼應該是「不可能打開」的。=In that case, his password shouldn't have opened that door.
利用……控制……劫持……\n還是說，另有其他關係……？=Through exploitation, control, hijacking...\nOr maybe...?
唔，我們還沒有足夠的情報，\n現在無論怎麼想都只是猜測而已。=No. Without more information, all we can do is speculate.
反正現在也回不去，還是往前走走看吧？\n說不定{{A}}裡有線索呢。=If we can't go back, let's keep movin' forward. Maybe we'll find a hint in the {{A}}.
在隊伍裡有普通人類的情況下探索{{A}}，\n吾雖然難以認同……但眼下也別無他法了。=I'd rather not explore with a Persona-less human in tow, but we haven't much choice.
吾等就一邊保護{{A}}，\n一邊繼續前進吧。=Let's continue our search while keeping {{A}} safe.

那個貌似{{A}}的認知存在，\n可能還在對面。=The {{A}} cognition is likely still beyond that door.
現在只能前進了，WONDER。=We must continue onward, Wonder.
……這是什麼？=...The hell is that?
學校的黑板……還有投影儀？\n好像在播什麼影片……=A projection of a classroom? Seems like it's playing some kind of video...
旁白=Narration
禁止暴力行為。=Violence is prohibited.
學生的父親=Student's Father
怎麼有人會因為家長沒接電話，\n就往人家公司打電話啊！=What kind of teacher calls a parent's workplace just because they didn't answer the phone!?
可是你的兒子，已經曠課3天了！=Your son has been absent for three days in a row with no explanation!
都已經是高中生了，管他幹嘛呀！\n你讓我在公司出醜的事你怎麼負責啊！=Who cares! He's just a high school kid! That's no excuse to embarrass me at work!
比起自己的臉面……\n就不能多關心一下孩子嗎！=You should be more concerned about your child than your reputation!
這是在侵害個人隱私。=Invasions of privacy are prohibited.
這都什麼……=What was that...?
有一段，就是不久前發生的事吧？=That was footage of the lighter incident, wasn't it?
還有其他影片=Plus other footage too
後面那段，\n是{{A}}……和誰的爸爸吧？=The scene after that was {{A}} and... someone's dad?
唔，好像又有新的影像了？=Oh, another video is starting.
聽說你把{{A}}開除了？是真的嗎？\n他在這裡其實做的很開心的。=Is it true you fired {{A}}? \nHe really seemed to love this job.
我問他怎麼了，\n他只是說都是自己的錯……=I asked him about it, but he just said that it was his own fault...
抱歉，{{A}}，是這樣的……=Sorry, {{A}}. The truth is...
朝美食藝人……潑水……！？=He threw water on a food critic...!?
……可是，錯的不是{{A}}。\n那個{{B}}，應該從一開始就想威脅我們店……=...Yeah, but {{A}} was justified. It seemed like {{B}} was trying to hurt our shop.
先不說這些了，\n總之，這時候……我們必須保護好他。=Forget about that. Right now he needs us to protect him.
如果那段影片傳出去，這孩子的未來就毀了。\n我去跟電視臺談談看。=If that video goes public, his future will be ruined. I'll talk to the TV station.
不管怎麼樣，{{B}}，\n你還是要照顧好{{A}}。=So, please, {{B}}, don't give up on {{A}}.
禁止過度干涉私人生活。=Meddling in private affairs is prohibited.
啊……{{A}}往{{B}}身上潑水的畫面，\n原來沒播出是這個原因……=So that's why the video of {{A}} throwing water at {{B}} never aired...
……嗯，後來{{A}}也和我說了。=...Yeah, I heard from {{A}} afterward.
{{A}}，不止去了電視臺，\n還跑去找了很多人低頭道歉……={{A}} begged the TV station and a bunch of other people...
是{{A}}她、保護了我，\n明明全都是……我的錯……！=All to protect me... Even though it was my fault!
今天我是來和您談談關於{{A}}的事。=I'm here today to discuss {{A}}.
這次是{{A}}？\n好像比現在頭髮要短一些……=This one's about {{A}}?\nYour hair's shorter...
我……高一時候，發生的事……=It was when I was a first-year student.
沒記錯的話……\n在這之前，{{A}}她……=That's right. Just before this, {{A}}...
同班女同學=Female Classmate
{{A}}，\n偶爾也和我們一起走吧？={{A}}, wanna walk home together?
大家決定去{{B}}玩哦，\n要不，{{A}}也一起去吧！=A group of us are gonna hang out in {{B}}. You should join us, {{A}}!
……不好意思，今天要去委員會。=...Sorry, I have a committee meeting today.
那，大家明天見，玩的開心哦。=I'll see you tomorrow. Have a nice time.
早就說了嘛，肯定會被拒絕呀，\n{{A}}她不可能會來的啦。=See? I told you she'd say no. {{A}} can't hang.
她還真是不合群啊～又是委員會，\n又要給家裡幫忙，還要學習什麼的。=It's always some excuse with her～ Helping her family, committee meetings, studying... She's so cold!
她要是不想跟我們玩，\n直說不就好了～=If she doesn't wanna hang out with us, \nshe should just say so～
身為優等生的社長{{B}}，\n怎麼可能跟普通人一起玩嘛，{{A}}。=Little miss honor student heiress can't associate with peasants like us! {{A}}!
……偶爾去和別的同學交流一下，\n這個對將來有幫助嗎。=...For the sake of my future, perhaps I should interact with my classmates more often.
對將來有沒有幫助，這種想法本身……\n可能有點不太對呢。=For the sake of your future? \nThat's not quite why you should do it.
可以聊一會兒嗎？=Got a minute?
可以聊一下嗎？=Got a minute?
{{A}}，你是不是在勉強自己啊？=Aren't you pushing yourself too hard, {{A}}?
雖然給家裡幫忙和學習都很重要，\n也可以理解……但是……=I understand and admire your dedication to your studies and your family business, but...
我在乎的是，\n這些真的是你想做的事情嗎？=I'm a bit concerned about whether or not this is what you really want.
如果是我誤會了，那我道歉。\n不過你看起來過得很壓抑。=Correct me if I'm wrong, \nbut you seem trapped.
似乎你做的所有事，\n都是以是否對家族和事業有幫助來決定的……=It's as if everything you do is based on if you think it will help your family business...
……我沒有在勉強自己。=...I'm not forcing myself to.
對家業是否有幫助……以此來作為判斷標準，\n這個確實如您所說……=It is true that I take my family's company into account when making decisions, but...
但這是因為我覺得，自己就應該這樣。=That's because I personally believe doing so is for the best.
在我看來，{{A}}，\n被繼承{{B}}的責任束縛得太緊了。=I feel that {{A}} is under excessive pressure as {{B}}'s successor.
幫忙打理家業，努力學習，\n這些都是很了不起很重要的事……=It's both wonderful and important to study hard and help one's family, but...
但我覺得現在的她，\n卻連一個可以安心放鬆的地方都沒有了。=Right now, it seems she has no space to decompress.
人在學生階段，應該是拓寬見聞，\n尋找自己想要去做什麼的時期。=School is a time for kids to broaden their horizons and find themselves.
能不能請您……\n好好地面對自己女兒內心的意願呢？=So I'd like to ask you to consider letting your daughter follow her heart.
我同意您的說法，\n不過，{{A}}早就過了這個時期了。=I agree with your sentiment, however, that time for {{A}} has long since passed.
我並沒有強迫{{A}}做什麼，\n只是讓她去做想做的事情而已哦？=I do not push {{A}} in the least. I support what she wants to do.
我並沒有強迫{{A}}做什麼，\n只是讓她去做想做的事情而已哦！=I do not push {{A}} in the least. I support what she wants to do.
{{A}}，我沒說錯吧？=Right, {{A}}?
是的……繼承{{A}}，\n我認為才是我作為獨生女的使命……=Yes... As your only child, it is my duty to inherit {{A}}...
不，是我該做的事。\n{{A}}，這就是我想做的事情。=I mean, I believe it is the best path for me. This is what I want, {{A}}.
您明白了的話，就請回吧。=If we've reached an understanding, \nthen please be on your way.
可是，{{A}}她……！=But {{A}} is...!
禁止過度干涉家庭環境。=Meddling in family affairs is prohibited.
剛才那一幕，我有印象……=I remember that day...
黑板上投射的，都是{{A}}的記憶……\n是這樣吧，CATTLE？=These are {{A}}'s memories. \nRight, Cattle?
嗯，而且是在{{A}}的記憶中，\n留下了強烈牽掛的事情……=Indeed. These moments must have had a deep impact on {{A}}...
同時，這也體現了{{A}}「想要親近學生」、\n「想要拯救學生」這些慾望的意志。=They also show that {{A}} harbors a strong desire to support and protect her students.
原來她那麼想……=<size\=27>To think she felt this way...</size>
{{B}}{{A}}……！\n她真的是個很棒的{{C}}啊……！=Yeah, {{A}}'s an amazing teacher...!
但依照剛才的影像，這種慾望，\n被拒絕，被禁止，甚至可能被扭曲了。=But from what we've just seen, her desire is being condemned, forbidden, and warped.
而那個意志……或許，\n或許已經在自我中開始被拋棄了。=It's possible her heart is starting to abandon it.
想要跟學生親近一點，這不是件好事嗎！\n為什麼要被否認……！=Bein' supportive of your students is a good thing! Why is she getting flack for that...!?
啊……現在學校裡發生的事情，\n不就是這樣嗎……？=Isn't that exactly what's going on at school right now...?
{{C}}拋棄了學生，{{A}}的工作也變多了，\n這都是因為按照{{B}}的建議……={{B}}'s consulting has made the teachers ignore the students and overwork {{A}}.
仔細想想，會不會{{A}}的慾望，\n就是被{{B}}奪走的……？=If you really think about it, it's more like {{B}} stole {{A}}'s desire, huh...?
這樣一來，\n這不就是{{A}}了嗎！=Wait, so is this {{A}} after all!?
唔……單從心聲判斷，\n吾認為這裡仍算是{{A}}……=Hoom... Based on the collective unconscious, we thought this was {{A}}, but...
也許是哪裡出錯了。\n一直有種揮之不去的不協調感。=Perhaps there has been a mix-up. \nSomething certainly feels amiss.
為了找出這種感覺的原因，\n吾等也要繼續前進。=Let's investigate further and get to the bottom of this.
「想要親近學生」……\n如果那是{{A}}的慾望………=If {{A}}'s desire is to support her students...
否認她慾望的……就是……=Then the one who denied that is...

似乎能從這裡出去。=This looks like an exit.
不清楚前面會發生什麼，\n而且吾等身邊還有一個不能參戰的人……=I cannot sense what lies ahead. It's also risky with one person unable to fight...
大家請務必謹慎行動。=Everyone, stay alert.

{{A}}？這個地方是……？={{A}}? What is this place...?
好像來到隧道外面了。=Looks like we're outside.
……不妙，\n這個地形幾乎沒有藏身之處。=...This is less than ideal. \nThere are few places to hide.
{{A}}還在隊中，需要避免與敵人交手，\n或許要尋找其他路線看看。=I'd like to avoid a battle while {{A}} is with us. We should search for another route.
要不原路返回？=Or we can go back?
或許往回走也行=Why not turn around?
同意，說不定那個像{{A}}已經不在了，\n往回走走看好了……=True. I bet that Pseudo-{{A}} is gone by now, so if we head back the way we came...
{{A}}……同學？={{A}}-san?
你、你是……{{A}}！？=Is that... {{A}}!?
……{{A}}的陰影嗎！=...It's {{A}}'s Shadow!
這就是……陰影……=That's... a Shadow...?
{{B}}就登場了嗎，\n帶著{{A}}，還想儘量避免戰鬥的啊……！=The {{B}} appears at last. I would rather avoid a fight with {{A}} here, but...!
{{A}}……\n為什麼，你會在這裡？={{A}}…\nWhy are you here?
這裡很危險……\n快……回去……=It's too dangerous... \nTurn back... Hurry...
大家，小心！=Be careful!
別大意=Stay on your toes
啊，大家準備應戰！=Right! Stand at the ready!
……沒有攻過來、嗎？=...She's not going to attack us, is she?
啊，怎麼看起來……\n她反而好像還在擔心我們。=I don't think so. If anything, she seems worried about us.
感覺跟{{A}}和{{B}}完全不一樣……\n嘗試跟她溝通說不定她會交出{{C}}……=She's not like {{A}} and {{B}} at all. If we try talking to her, she might just give us her {{C}}.
{{A}}，我們想要救你。={{A}}, we want to help you.
{{B}}，你能告訴我們……\n為什麼你會有這個{{A}}啊！=Please, tell us why this {{A}} exists, {{B}}!
你們……難道是……=Wait... Are you all—
唔，發生了什麼事……！？=Wh-What's going on...!?
不行……！快，逃……\n這裡……很危險……=It's no use! Get out now.\nIt's too... dangerous.
快點……立刻，離開這裡……=Just leave... Hurry...
你沒事吧，{{A}}！？=You okay, {{A}}!?
我都說了！叫你們逃走{{A}}！！=I'm tellin' you to scram!!

{{C}}……{{A}}，{{B}}！={{C}}... {{A}}, {{B}}!
別、別打了，{{A}}！\n我們是來救你的！=Agh! Please, stop! We don't wanna hurt you!
她的慾望扭曲了，現在已經失控了……！\n這樣下去吾等就只能挨打，撐不下去的！=Her twisted desires are running wild! If we let our guard down, we're done for!
吾等不能在這種地方被打敗……！\n先給{{A}}<color\=#ff0000>一定程度的傷害</color>吧！=We can't allow ourselves to lose here! We'll have to <color\=#ff0000>deal some damage to {{A}}</color>!
只有這個辦法嗎……？\n對不起了……{{A}}！=There's really no other choice...?\nI'm sorry, {{A}}!
{{A}}的力量在不斷提高……！\n是有什麼在搗鬼！={{A}}'s power is intensifying! \nShe must be planning something!
{{A}}！聽我們說啊！={{A}}! Please, listen to us!
唔？{{A}}的狀態有些……=Huh? {{A}} is acting strange...

那是……像{{A}}的那個陰影！？=Is that {{A}}!?
為，為什麼？\n那個不是{{A}}製造的認知存在嗎？=But why? Isn't that {{A}}'s own cognition?
為什麼反而會攻擊{{A}}！？=Why would it attack {{A}}!?
不對……\n原來如此，吾終於明白了！=Wait... That's it. \nAt last I understand!

嗯，最開始{{A}}的氣息太微弱了。\n以至於吾無法確定……=Yes. I was uncertain at first because of {{A}}'s weak aura, but...
這次弄明白了，那兩個人，\n各自擁有獨立的意識。=There's no mistake. They possess the will of two distinct human beings.
沒有任何一方是另一方的認知存在……=It's not a question of who is the cognition of who...
而是兩個「都是」，\n從不同人類心中誕生的陰影！=They are both individual Shadows!
一個{{B}}裡有２個{{A}}……\n還會有這種事嗎！？=Two rulers in one {{B}}? \nIs that even possible!?

你不是「{{A}}」嗎！\n毆打學生什麼的不是你的拿手好戲嘛！=Come on, you're the violent K-sensei of K Academy! Now give those kids a good beating!
不是……不是的，我……！=No... You're wrong! I—
原本你就沒法再回到學校工作了，\n現在連「{{A}}」的職責都做不到嗎？=You'll never be allowed to return to school again. And now you can't even punish the students like the {{A}} you are?

{{A}}現在已經奄奄一息了……\n繼續攻擊她的話，可能會危及生命……！={{A}} is already at death's door. \nAnother attack might put her life at risk!
總之先<color\=#ff0000>打倒周圍的陰影</color>吧！=First let's <color\=#ff0000>take out the other Shadows</color>!
我都叫你們快跑了，為什麼……\n我已經……不知道自己在做什麼了……=I told you to run... Why won't you go? I'm not even sure...what I'm doing anymore...

{{A}}～真是沒用啊！\n不過，只有能利用好這種廢物……={{A}}～ You really are useless! But exploiting that incompetence...
才顯得出本顧問的手段！=...is part of my consulting expertise!
混蛋……！\n你給我下來！卑鄙小人！=Damn it...! \nGet down here, you little chickenshit!

我……怎麼可能做這種事……=I could... never do that!
你是我……重要的……學生……=You're my... precious student...

不需要在心裡還裝出一副{{B}}的樣子……\n打我一頓就能輕鬆一點了吧，{{A}}！=Don't carry on the teacher act even inside your own heart. Just hit me and stop suffering, {{A}}!
不……\n我不是逼著自己裝出{{A}}的樣子……=No... I'm not forcing myself to act like a teacher...

為什麼……我明明已經甩開你的手了……=Why? Even though I pushed you away...
可是，你還是一次次地伸手過來……\n為什麼就算自己受傷，也要保護我……=Why do you keep reaching out to me? Why do you put yourself at risk to protect me?
{{A}}！\n這還真成了昭和年代電視劇了！={{A}}! This really is a soap opera!
但熱血教師這種催淚的校園題材，\n如今已經騙不到收視率了哦？=Mushy school stories about passionate teachers get terrible ratings these days!

這樣啊，\n那下次你要努力當第一哦。=I see. Then study harder to be number one next time.
你是{{A}}的繼承者，\n在這個位置上的人，不可以露出弱點。=You will inherit {{A}}'s legacy one day. And leaders do not show weakness.
為了獲得令所有人都心悅誠服的成績，\n你必須一直努力，明白了嗎？=Devote yourself to achieving consistent grades that won't bring embarrassment on our name. Understood?
社長秘書=President's Secretary
因為你是社長{{A}}，\n我才對你這麼好哦。=I was only nice to you because you're the president's daughter.
{{A}}……你不會以為別人是真的愛你吧？={{A}}... Do you honestly think people love you for you?
沒有{{A}}大小姐這個身份，\n誰都不會多看你一眼！=If you weren't the heir to {{A}}, no one would even look at you!
因為我要繼承{{A}}，\n大家才那麼在乎我……=People are only kind to me because I'm the heir to {{A}}...
如果想被人在乎，\n我就必須繼承{{A}}……=If I want to be treated with respect, I have to become worthy of my title...
想要得到愛……不對……=If I want to be loved... No...
「愛」什麼的……\n必須從我的心裡舍去……=There is no love for me in this world... \nI have to give up on it...

做一個父母期待的完美女兒。=The perfect daughter my parents want.
必須演好「別人期待的角色」……=I'll keep playing the role expected of me...
你剛才說……「演好別人期待的角色」？="Play the role expected of you"?
什麼啊……這算什麼啊……=How stupid...
用不著刻意去扮演什麼角色……\n不也有人願意去愛原本的我嗎……！=I've had someone who loves me for me all along...!
她一直都在朝我伸出援手……\n而選擇甩開那只手的人……=She was always reaching out to me, but I just kept...
是我啊……{{A}}！=...pushing her away!

與其會被人說不愛我，\n那我從一開始，就不需要愛這種東西……=I told myself that if love meant risking rejection, then I didn't need it...
是我自己放棄了被愛的資格，\n但是……=I shut myself off from it altogether. But...
這份不求回報的愛，一直都在我身邊……！=Unconditional love was always right there in front of me!
哼，這種催淚題材沒人要看，\n我剛才不都說過了嘛～=Ugh! I told you people, that saccharine sitcom schtick will only bore viewers to tears.
還是說……難道你……是「想要被愛」啊？=Wait... Don't tell me... You really hoped someone would love you?
{{A}}！荒謬！\n大小姐還說什麼「愛」，實在是愚蠢透頂！={{A}}! Don't be absurd! Love and rich girls are like oil and water! You really are a fool!
那種東西，你已經得不到了。\n畢竟大家接近你都是因為～=You'll never have love. After all, every single person in your life...
{{A}}雄厚的財力……\n可不都是為了錢嘛！=...is only after {{A}}'s wealth and influence!

等等，我來就行！=Uh, no, no. I'll do it!
啊？為什麼啊。=Huh? Why?
{{A}}是女生，\n而且SOY……感覺你有點笨手笨腳的。=Well, a) {{A}} is a girl, and b) you're kinda ham-fisted, Soy.
笨手笨腳！？=Ham-fisted!?
那讓我來=I'll do it
我背你吧？=<size\=30>Want a piggyback ride?</size>
我來公主抱……=<size\=28>I'll carry you in my arms...</size>
唔……CLOSER的意思是，因為{{A}}是女性，\n所以男生需要注意……=But did Closer not say she was concerned as a fellow girl?
背……{{A}}，不可以！\n要背也是我背！！=Piggyback!? Um, no. Veto! If anyone's going to do it, it'll be me!

吾最初就注意到了。\n在這個慾望枯竭的世界裡，{{A}}你啊……=I've been curious about this for quite some time. In this world of withering desire...
主動提出「調查」{{A}}，並讓吾等採取行動，\n就算很危險，最後也依舊達成了目標對吧？=...not only did Tanemura stir us to investigate {{A}}, she also put herself at great personal risk doing so.
恐怕從那時起，你的慾望素養就已經覺醒，\n{{A}}也變成了半覺醒的形態了。=That is likely when your potential desire bloomed and your {{A}} partially awakened.
這個聲音是……CATTLE？=That voice... Cattle?
正是，現實世界裡吾的名字叫{{A}}。\n吾這個姿態是不是也很倜儻啊？=Correct. In the real world, my name is {{A}}. This form is quite modish, wouldn't you say?
r:"^啊，藏在(.*)同學書包裡的貓頭鷹，\n我那時候聽到的聲音就是你……$"="I see. Then the voice I heard came from the owl hiding in $1-kun's bag..."
我在咖啡廳之所以能聽到你在說話，\n是因為我即將覺醒……是這樣吧。=Perhaps I heard you in the café because I was starting to awaken.
估計是的。=That's quite probably the case.
話說，吾的貓頭鷹姿態，\n是不是也很倜儻啊？=By the way, my owl form is quite modish, don't you think?
……你剛才不是問過了嗎？=...Didn't you just ask that?
肯定是想聽人家說「倜儻」啦……=I bet he wants you to say, "Yes! Very modish!"...
{{A}}，看來很貪心呢。\n不過比起倜儻，不如說是「瀟灑」吧？={{A}}, what an avaricious little owl. But I would say it's more soigné, wouldn't you agree?
哦哦！！\n你可是個明白人啊。=Hoohoo! Finally, someone who gets it!
瀟……灑？=Swan... Yay?
按現在的說法，就是很灑脫吧，\n意思是既率性又優雅。=In modern terms, it means stylish. \nSomething that is simple yet elegant.

終於……終於有人能理解吾的語言了……！\n忍了{{A}}和{{B}}這麼久，你懂的吧！？=Yes! Finally! Someone who understands what I'm talking about! Aren't {{A}} and {{B}} utterly exasperating!?

身體感覺有點撐不下去了。\n我想早點躺下休息。=I'm starting to feel the day's exhaustion catching up with me. I'd like to get home and lay down.
喔，對不住。\n原本是為了讓你恢復才撤退的……=Oh right, my apologies. We came back here so you could rest...
啊！我來送{{A}}回家！=Oh! I'll walk you home!
不要緊，我叫車就行。\n謝謝你、{{A}}。=That's all right, I'll call a car. \nThank you, {{A}}.
那我們就學校再見了，\n到時候有很多事情要問你們呢。=Well then, I'll see you all at school. \nLet's talk more then.

{{A}}，不用緊張，\n只是同往常一樣想和「你」聊聊。=Ah, do not be alarmed. I simply hope to speak with you as usual.
那麼進入正題吧……\n我有一個問題想問。=So, without further delay... There is a particular question I would like you to answer.
讓慾望正在枯竭的人，再次萌發慾望……=I understand there exist two ways...
有兩種方法，以下是我的理解。=...for hopeless individuals to rejuvenate their withered desire.
第一種，在與他人的相處中和相互作用下，\n「摸索」出將來的道路……=One can spend years interacting with others, \nfumbling to grasp at just a little...
另一種方法則是……=Or...
利用壓倒性的影響力「干涉」對方，\n使其懷有慾望。=They can amass indomitable influence to manipulate and consume the desires of others.
你覺得哪種方法……啊，我換個問法吧。=Which do you... No. \nLet me ask you this way...
如果是「你」，\n你更喜歡哪種方法呢？=If it were you, which method would you chose?
在相處中摸索=Fumbling over time
壓倒性影響力干涉=Exerting my influence
我不知道=I'm not sure
{{A}}……我就知道「你」會這麼選……={{A}}... As I expected...
喔……{{A}}，真是意外，\n「你這邊」居然會這麼選……=Oh? {{A}}, what an uncharacteristic response.
{{A}}，這樣啊，你是這麼想的嗎……={{A}}, I see. Is that how you feel...
……我所說的那兩種方法，\n都與慾望的「先導」有關。=...These methods both have the power to drive desire.
如果其中之一期望更高的地位……=But if either seeks supremacy...
還記得我之前提過嗎，\n決定「優劣」的衝突想必就無法避免了。=...an inevitable battle with ensue.
{{A}}對您迄今為止在磨煉慾望方面的成就，\n給予了肯定……希望您能理解領會。=Regarding your efforts to strengthen your desire, please be aware my master values the achievements you have made thus far.
{{A}}……我還想聊聊，\n關於你們那個「幕後黑手」的話題。={{A}}… Now, I wish to discuss this "mastermind" you all speak of.
你為什麼會知道？=<size\=25>How do you know about that?</size>
你認識幕後黑手嗎？=<size\=30>Do you know who it is?</size>
啊……之前我也說過，\n我們不能為你的旅程提示答案。=Well, as I have said, we cannot grant you the answers you seek on this journey.
要抵抗將來的{{A}}……\n就必須始終待在更優秀的一側。=To escape imminent ruin... you must remain on the winning side.

可是，\n為什麼他們的{{A}}是在同一個地方？=But why do they both have a {{A}} in the same place?
{{A}}和{{B}}地點，是不一樣的吧？={{A}} and {{B}}'s were in separate areas.
準確來說，\n是一個{{A}}裡存在「兩個{{B}}」。=To be more precise, the two of them exist as the rulers of one {{A}}.
兩個{{B}}共用一個{{A}}……\n也就是所謂的「複合型{{A}}」。=A single {{A}} co-ruled by both of them. \nA "Joint Palace," if you will.
複合型……\n為什麼會變成這樣？=A Joint Palace? \nWhy the heck did that happen?
唔，吾目前的想法是……=Why indeed. Well, my thoughts are...
主要原因是，\n{{B}}和{{A}}在現實世界中的交集。=Firstly, I believe the fact that {{B}} and {{A}} are connected in the real world is a large part of it.
使{{A}}兩人的陰影扭曲失控也產生了交集，\n令慾望混雜到了一起……=So in the {{A}}, that toxic connection entangled their twisted desires as their Shadows began clashing.
換言之，各自的負面情感彼此滋養，\n導致扭曲的慾望空前膨脹，其結果就是……=In short, their negative emotions have synergized, amplifying one another's twisted desires.
兩者結合，形成了這座複合型{{A}}。=Those melded desires most likely resulted in a Joint {{A}}.
{{B}}步步緊逼，導致{{A}}迷失了自我，\n甚至連慾望都被扭曲了……={{A}} lost control of herself and her desire because {{B}} put her in a corner.
這正是{{A}}的計畫。\n對{{B}}的逼迫和扭曲都是他的手段……=However, that was his intention. His provocations sent her into a downward spiral...
之後就形成了{{B}}，\n這一點也可能包含在了{{A}}的計畫之內。=Then the {{B}} came about. \nThat was likely part of his scheme as well.
計畫……？=Scheme...?
故意造出了複合{{A}}？=<size\=20>He intended to make a Joint {{A}}?</size>
我曾經提到過，\n{{A}}從前擔任過企業顧問的事情吧？=I've mentioned before that {{A}} was formerly a business consultant, right?
那之後，\n我又調查了一些與他相關企業的輿論……=Well, I did some digging into the companies he worked with...
「那些所謂堅持匠心的人不過是在以老賣老，\n他們離開之後，公司內的氣氛都變好了」……="The company culture improved once that meticulous old-timer finally hit the bricks."
「總是把夢想掛在嘴邊的社員其實都很廢物，\n被解雇了真是大快人心」……等等。="I'm glad that useless daydreamer got canned."
輿論的中心，\n必然會有一個「顯而易見的壞人」。=There is always an obvious villain.
堅持匠心的人就是以老賣老！？=So, what, a seasoned veteran can't have opinions!?
不是，討論夢想什麼的是個人自由吧！？=People SHOULD talk about their dreams!
嗯，我也是這麼想。=Yes, I agree.
一個團隊，存在各種各樣的人是很正常的。\n因為想法不合就逼人辭職……這是錯的。=Employees are not a hive mind. Firing someone just because you don't agree with them is... odd.
顧問的工作目的不是「找出壞人」，\n而是改善業務中的無效工作和習慣。=A real consultant doesn't place blame. \nThey fix inefficiency and unfair practices.
包括這些與團隊不合的人在內，\n正確地引導大家，才是顧問的職責所在。=Even if an employee is an ill fit for a team, it's better for everyone to cooperate and aim for success together.
然而……事實是{{A}}的成功，\n必然伴隨著「壞人」的出現。=However... {{A}}'s success stories almost always revolve around a "villain."
透過消除團隊中的「壞人」，表面上看，\n他改善了經營環境，實際上只有他一人獲利。=Getting rid of them makes management look proactive, and Akashi receives all the credit.
{{A}}是想說……！=So you're saying...!
他故意「塑造」壞人？=He creates villains?
故意把矛頭指向……？=He finds scapegoats?
為了自己的成功？=<size\=23>He succeeds at others' expense?</size>
會這麼推斷也很自然，不過……=That's my guess. Even so...
我認為{{A}}發現的問題並不完全是捏造的。\n畢竟任何團體裡或多或少都有一些問題人物。=They're not exactly false accusations. Every company has its share of bad apples after all.
但……即便如此，經過長時間的磨合，\n他們原本早該融入了團隊才對，但事實是……=But this number of long-time, dedicated employees suddenly being incriminated right after Akashi arrives...
在{{A}}到任後不久，他們的行為，\n就開始出現問題、受到懲罰……未免太巧了。=...is too high to be plausible.
原本燃盡了的火種，卻被{{A}}故意點著了，\n這是你想說的吧。=You mean to say {{A}} was actively sowing the seeds of discord at these companies?
而且，我想讓你們看看這個……=There's something else too. \nTake a look at this...
{{A}}嗎？\n這個，是最近熱度很高的「{{B}}」吧？={{A}}? That's the "{{B}}" everyone's talking about.
這個人，其實是……{{A}}。=This person is... {{A}}.
這個是{{A}}電腦裡的影片。=I found this video on {{A}}'s computer.
在公園廁所附近，拍到{{A}}換上配送員制服，\n然後騎自行車離開的身影。=She changes into a delivery uniform in a public bathroom, then races off on a bicycle.
在公園廁所附近，拍到{{A}}換上配送員制服，\n然後騎腳踏車離開的身影。=She changes into a delivery uniform in a public bathroom, then races off on a bicycle.
怎麼會……這是騙人的吧？=No way... This can't be real.
很遺憾，這是事實。\n所以……這就意味著……=Unfortunately, it's the truth. \nThis video also means...
{{C}}之前就「知道」，\n{{A}}是{{B}}。={{C}} already knew {{A}} was the {{B}}.
他早就知道{{B}}便於被塑造成{{A}}……\n便於被當成「壞人」，所以才選擇她下手。=He knew she'd be an easy target to make into a {{A}} and fill his villain role.
所以他才故意挑起事端，激怒{{B}}……\n再給{{B}}貼上{{A}}的標籤嗎！=That's why he started shit with her? \nSo she'd be labeled a {{A}}!?
那接下來……他就要解雇{{A}}，趕走{{A}}，\n然後把這事當成自己顧問工作的業績嗎！？=And he's trying to get her fired just so he can look like some great consultant!
嗯，{{A}}之所以戴著智慧眼鏡，\n應該也是為了錄下「壞人」的證據……=That's right. Also, I assume {{A}} wears smart glasses as a means to catch his "villains" in the act.
之後……\n一旦落入他的陷阱，就逃不掉了。=Once he gets them on tape, it becomes impossible for them to escape accusation.
按剛才說的，之前被{{A}}塑造成壞人的人，\n有精神上出現問題的……也有走上絕路的。=And I said before, many of his victims have suffered severe emotional dysregulation... and even lost their lives.
那麼，目前正在被剝奪慾望的{{A}}……=Then if Akashi is stealing Katayama's desires away...
有可能會發生同樣的事……！=She might end up the same!?
……有這種可能性。=...I can't say for sure.
放任{{A}}這樣下去，受害者會一直出現。=But if we ignore {{A}}, \nmore people will fall victim.
而且警察也很難發現這種問題……對吧。=While the police stay totally oblivious...
連{{A}}這樣的好人都成了受害者……\n我不會放過他的……！=And that bastard keeps sacrificing good people like {{A}} for his own gain...!
想起來個事……=Come to think of it...
我見過{{A}}……=<size\=25>I've seen {{A}}...</size>
她什麼時候當騎手的？=<size\=26>When did she start doing it?</size>
r:"^啊！你一說我也想起來了，(.*)，\n之前應該是在電車裡……$"="Oh yeah! $1 got hit once on the train!"
嗯，在{{B}}來學園之前，\n{{A}}就已經出現了。=So that behavior was going on long before {{B}} came into the picture.
這樣推斷的話，\n{{B}}騎車狂飆的事就與{{A}}無關了……=Which means {{A}} can't be the cause of Katayama-sensei's reckless cycling habit.
啊……那到底是怎麼回事……=Yeah... I guess you're right...
{{A}}說起過，{{B}}還是學生的時候，\n只要心情不好就會騎自行車去很遠的地方……={{A}} told us she used to ride her bike for hours whenever she got upset...
{{A}}說起過，{{B}}還是學生的時候，\n只要心情不好就會騎腳踏車去很遠的地方……={{A}} told us she used to ride her bike for hours whenever she got upset...
騎車雖然可以放鬆下心情……\n但飆車就很危險了，這就不對了吧……=I get that it must clear her head, but terrorizing the neighborhood is not so great, huh...
{{A}}會不會，是想把學校裡積累的壓力，\n透過騎車的方式發洩出來呢……={{A}} probably rides to release her pent-up stress from school...
{{A}}會不會，是想把學校裡累積的壓力，\n透過騎車的方式發洩出來呢……={{A}} probably rides to release her pent-up stress from school...
……{{A}}那些壓力裡頭，\n應該也有我的原因在吧。=...And I am surely one source of that frustration.
填未來調查表時……=<size\=30>My career questionnaire...</size>
不只是你們，我其實平常……\n也會有害怕{{A}}的時候……=You guys aren't the only ones at fault. I used to be kinda scared of her, and it probably showed...
我也不好。一直讓{{A}}擔心，\n但我卻不願和她好好聊一下……=Yeah... I worried her constantly and didn't ask for help when I needed it.
似乎大家都覺得自己有責任……=It feels like we're all to blame...
……好了，吾能理解你們的感受，\n但眼下吾等還是回到工作本身吧？=...I understand how you all feel, but can we return to the topic at hand?
畢竟能阻止{{B}}和{{A}}失控的，\n也只有吾等了。=We are the only ones who can stop {{B}} and {{A}}s from running amuck after all.
……沒錯，謝謝你，{{A}}。\n那先繼續說一下我的推測吧……=...You're right. Thank you, {{A}}. Now, to continue explaining my thoughts...
{{A}}，外觀是水壩吧？={{A}} is a dam, correct?
對，{{A}}他們說過這事，我們在想，\n是不是因為以前{{B}}騎車去過水壩的緣故……=Yeah. I thought it was 'cause she used to ride her bike there like {{A}} said...
或許有這個原因……\n但剛才從{{A}}的話裡，我想到一件事。=That is one possibility... But something occurred to me as {{A}} spoke just now.
那個水壩的結構，\n很可能是兩個{{A}}之間關係的象徵。=What if the dam symbolizes the relationship between the two rulers?
兩個人關係的象徵……？=Their relationship...?
{{A}}不得不透過飆車發洩的壓力……\n不，應該說是「{{B}}」的情感……={{A}}'s stifled frustration or, {{B}} really, which she can only release on her bike...
這些累積的「{{B}}」，\n被{{A}}利用為自己的力量………=In a way, {{A}} is feeding off of it to improve his own station...
{{A}}的「{{C}}」是會生成能量的水壩……\n然後{{B}}吸收了它嗎……？=So the dam turns {{A}}'s {{C}} into energy, which {{B}} absorbs?
有道理啊！第一次見到{{A}}的時候，\n他就是把電線插進地裡面、然後就恢復了！=Oh yeah! When we first saw him, \nhe stuck a cable into the ground to heal himself!
水壩的能量……\n{{A}}居然把{{B}}內心的情感當成能量吸收嗎！=Then he's leeching off the dam's energy!? \nNo... He's leeching off Katayama-san's heart!
不可饒恕=Unforgivable
慾望「被剝奪了」=Desires being stolen
嗯，還有……那個{{B}}的門鎖，\n用的是{{A}}的密碼。=Yes. Moreover, {{A}}'s password was the key to that door in the {{B}}.
從{{B}}和{{A}}的關係情況來看，\n水壩的實際控制者，應該是{{B}}……=So, between their two Shadows, {{B}} seems to be the one in charge.
所以我認為這個水壩結構的本質，\n是「{{B}}控制並利用了{{A}}」……=In other words, the dam is under his control, and {{A}} is just being exploited by him.
控制、利用……！=Control... Exploit...!
混蛋！他在吸收能量之前，\n明明弱到連{{A}}都注意不到！=Shit! Before he started leechin', \nhe wasn't even a speck on {{A}}'s radar!
唔，的確相比{{A}}的陰影，\n他的氣息還要再微弱一些。=Well, his presence was weaker than the Shadows in {{A}}.
哦？這種情況的話……=Really? Then...
與其說是控制，\n或許應該說是「寄生」在那更準確。=Perhaps rather than controlling her, \nhe's more like a parasite.
對對，我感覺也是這樣！\n那可是{{A}}……不可能有人能控制她的！=That makes way more sense! I can't picture {{A}} being controlled by anyone!
那，做個總結吧。=So, to summarize...
只要{{C}}還能吸取{{A}}的能量，\n那吾等就無法打敗{{B}}。=As long as {{C}} continues to absorb {{A}}'s energy, his Shadow is invincible.
意味著，吾等永遠偷不走{{A}}，\n所以當務之急需要切斷{{B}}的能量來源……=This means we can't steal {{A}}. We will need to cut off his source of power first...
為此，必須先偷取{{A}}，\n讓她改心才行。=But to do that, we'll need to steal {{A}} and invoke a change of heart.
讓{{A}}改心，嗎……=Change {{A}}'s heart...?
老實說，撇開{{B}}不談，\n我到現在也沒想通{{A}}為什麼會是{{C}}。=Honestly, {{B}} aside, I never believed {{A}} could be a {{C}}.
可如果她在我們不知道的地方做了危險的事，\n內心的「{{A}}」需要發洩的話……=If she's got repressed anger she can only let out by pullin' risky stunts in secret...
我想幫{{A}}擺脫痛苦。\n這也是我能做到的，去報答她的方式。=...then I wanna free her from that. That way I can at least sorta pay her back for everythin'.
……{{A}}，你不要想著自己去獨自承擔。=...Don't put this all on yourself, {{A}}.
{{A}}會變成這樣……\n或多或少也有我的責任。=I played no small part in {{A}}'s desires getting twisted.
我也是，直到進入{{B}}的{{A}}之前，\n我其實對{{B}}的事多少都有點懷疑……=Until going into her {{A}} and seeing who she really is, I didn't trust Katayama-sensei...
r:"^但現在，我絕不會讓真心愛學生的(.*)，\n再被(.*)利用，你說對不對、(.*)？$"="But she truly cares for all of her students. We can't let that creep treat her like an energy drink anymore. Right, $3?"
讓{{A}}=<size\=30>Let's {{A}}</size>
不會再讓他奪走=His schemes end here
吾也同意。\n那麼……這次也統一意見了。=I concur. Well, that gives us a unanimous decision.
既然吾等已經確定了目標，\n接下來要做的就是確認{{A}}路線了。=Our target is clear, so our next objective is to secure a route to her {{A}}.
嗯，我們再潛入那個{{B}}一次，\n找到{{A}}{{C}}的位置吧。=Right. Let's head back to the {{B}} and sniff it out.
啊……可以稍等一下嗎？=Oh, but first...
在去{{A}}之前，有件事……=There's something I'd like to do before we return to the {{A}}...

----------
Katayama Bar Calling Card
----------
……就是這。=...We're here.
{{B}}，等一下……！\n我、我們要進去這家店嗎，{{A}}？=H-Hold on! Are we really going in there, {{A}}!?
{{A}}似乎經常在這裡喝酒，\n我是……從{{B}}電腦的資訊裡分析出來的。={{A}} often comes here to drink. Another tidbit from {{B}}'s surveillance.
{{A}}現在被停職了，\n所以我們在學校裡是見不到她的吧？=And we can't meet her at school because she's suspended, remember?
但我們還未成年吧……\n進這種店不會被叫去訓話嗎……？=But, we're minors. Won't we get arrested or somethin'?
我們又不喝酒，沒關係，而且……=Don't worry, it's not like we're going to order drinks. Besides...
我也已經找好理由了，作為{{B}}，\n只是來調查有沒有{{A}}學生而已，很合理吧。=I can just say the Disciplinary Committee is here to check for errant students.
滴水不漏……=<size\=30>You think of everything...</size>
{{B}}，還是{{A}}厲害啊……=Yep, that's our {{A}}...
那，我們進去吧。=Let's head in.
果然……是上次那個帶著貓頭鷹的人……\n明明還是學生，怎麼會來這種店……？=I knew it. It's that kid with the owl... But what are they doing going into a bar?
而且……這次還多了1個人……=There's another person with them too...
他們、難道是……=Could they be...?
酒吧的店長=Bar Owner
歡迎光臨，\n哎呀呀，好年輕的客人啊。=Welcome! Oh my, quite the young folks, aren't you?
請放心，我們不是來喝酒的，\n只是……來貴店打擾一下。=Don't worry, we won't drink. \nWe'll... just be a few minutes.
{{B}}怎麼？\n{{A}}！？還有你們……！=Huh!? Wha—? {{A}}!? Where'd you all come from!?
你們在這裡做什麼啊，\n未成年人怎麼可以來這種店……！=You're minors! What are you doing here...!
我們是來找{{A}}的，因為{{A}}被停職了，\n在學校裡見不到你。=We can't meet at school since the suspension, so we came to you instead.
就，就算是這樣……\n也沒必要來這種地方吧……=S-Still... You shouldn't be here...
首先……=First...
對不起，{{A}}。=I'm sorry, {{A}}.
{{A}}……？怎麼了這是……？=Huh...? Wait, for what...?
無論是高一的時候，還是現在，\n一直以來{{A}}都向我伸出援手，想要幫我……=Ever since I was a first-year, you've always reached out to me. And yet...
可我卻誤以為那是偽善，\n總是擺出一副反感的態度。=I convinced myself that you didn't really care, and treated you coldly because of it.
有時……還會說這是過度干涉之類過分的話，\n這些我都記得。=I remember the cruel things I said to you... Calling you overbearing...
雖然事到如今才說出口……\n其實，我一直都覺得很開心。=This is long overdue, but the truth is, \nI was happy.
……不，應該說是，現在我才明白，\n自己原來是在感到開心。=...Or rather, I never appreciated how happy your concern made me until now.
那些我自己放棄掉的東西……\n{{A}}卻一直……想要為我付出……=You always gave me everything I had abandoned. All of the support and care...
{{A}}……怎麼了，突然說起這個？={{A}}, what on earth's gotten into you?
您現在不信任我，這也是沒辦法的事，\n畢竟過去我也……一直不相信{{A}}您……=I'm sure it's hard to believe. After all, I never let myself trust you, {{A}}.
但……就算您不信我所說的，\n我也下定決心，絕不會再放棄了。=That's why, even if you're not convinced, I won't give up on you.
就像{{A}}一直以來，對我那樣不離不棄……=Just as you never gave up on me...
我相信……我當然相信你……=I believe you... Of course I believe you...
雖然不知道發生了什麼事……\n但我很高興，謝謝你……=I'm not sure what happened, but I'm so happy to hear you say that. Thank you...
可我已經……不能再繼續做{{A}}了。=But I can't be your teacher anymore.
無限期的停職處分，再加上{{A}}的認定……=I'm a {{A}} on indefinite suspension.
而且……我也已經……累了……=And more than anything else, I'm just... so... tired.
唔、{{B}}的真實身份，\n也是{{A}}吧。=Oh that's right. You are the {{B}}, after all.
{{A}}……為什麼你會知道……=What...!? How do you know about that...!?
學，{{A}}！這事要現在說嗎……！={{A}}! Not here...!
真難為情啊，本應成為學生榜樣的{{A}}，\n卻在市內到處飆車……=How shameful. A teacher should set a good example. Not go on reckless joyrides.
作為{{A}}，我可不能放任不管。=The Disciplinary Committee can't ignore this.
唔，對不起……我……=I-I'm sorry. I...
所以……就由我來奪走{{A}}那份扭曲的慾望。=Therefore, I'm going to steal your warped desires away from you.
我會讓您，變回從前那個……\n正直坦率的{{A}}！=I'll put you back on the straight and narrow!
這是……怎麼回事？=What does that mean...?
就是……想請您早點回來上課的意思。=So... Please come back to school soon!
我也要道歉！\n總是讓您這麼操心，我還總是愛面子嘴硬……=I'm sorry too! You were worried about me, but I just acted like a brat and made things worse...
但我是真的很依賴{{A}}，也很尊敬{{A}}您……\n這都是我的真心話！=But I really rely on and look up to you so much...! Like, a lot!
還有我！\n{{A}}不在的話，我就靜不下心來！=Things aren't right without you at school.\nIt's too weird!
請{{A}}早點回來吧，\n你可是我們的班主任呢！=You're our homeroom teacher! \nPlease come back to school soon!
我們在學校等您=<size\=30>We'll be waiting for you</size>
可不准摸魚哦=No playing hooky
r:"^(.*)同學……嗯……$"="$1-kun..."
摸魚……{{A}}……=Hooky... {{A}}...
謝謝你們……\n願意接受……我這麼一個不夠格的{{A}}。=Thank you... for accepting a pathetic teacher like me.
……嗚，{{A}}……{{A}}～=...Sob, {{A}}... {{A}}～
哎呀哎呀……你啊，\n還真是有一群好學生呢，{{A}}。=Oh my... You've been blessed with such wonderful students, {{A}}.
那，你們要直接回家哦？路上注意安全。=Head straight home, okay? \nAnd be careful.
那，你們要直接回家哦！路上注意安全。=Head straight home, okay? \nAnd be careful.
好的，{{A}}！=Yes, {{A}}!
……啊，那個……=Um...
嗯？怎麼了，{{A}}？=Hm? What is it, {{A}}?
我能問個問題嗎？\n就是……{{A}}你、為什麼會飆車呢……=Well, I just gotta ask... Why'd you start riding crazy on your bike?
……那個是我一直以來的減壓方式，\n踩著腳踏板的時候，能夠忘記一切。=...That's always been my form of stress relief. When I hit those pedals, I can forget everything.
不過……我以前只要騎上車就會覺得放鬆，\n但最近卻……不知道為什麼……=But even though it always felt great in the past... Lately, for some reason...
一騎上車，身體就突然變得很熱，\n意識也越來越模糊……=My body suddenly heats up, and I feel like I can't control myself...
其實，{{A}}上放的那個闖進電車的事，\n我自己完全沒有印象了……=Honestly, I don't even remember crashing through the train like it said on {{A}}.
……啊，這只是我的藉口罷了。\n網上已經全都是照片了，都是我不對……=...B-But there's photo evidence everywhere, so I shouldn't be making excuses. I'm sorry.
看來我還是以前那個控制不住情緒、\n胡亂發洩的不良少女啊，完全沒有成長呢。=After all these years, I'm still the same wild, \nhot-headed delinquent.
我……不能再這樣了，我傷害的那些人，\n如果知道他們的身份，我一定會去道歉。=I need to grow up already. \nI want to apologize to everyone I hurt.
謝謝你們今天過來，\n我會試著好好地面對自己的。=Thanks for coming to see me today. \nI've got some self-reflecting to do.
{{A}}，怎麼了？=What's wrong, {{A}}?
啊，沒事……=Yeah... I mean, no.
{{A}}這個人，在精神世界中，\n就下定決心絕不對學生出手。=In {{A}}'s inner world, she absolutely refused to strike her students at the cost of her own safety.
信念如此頑強的女性卻放任{{A}}到處去飆車，\n……這實在是有點費解……=It's incomprehensible how one of such mental fortitude could surrender to blind rage...
……唔，眼下也沒有確鑿的證據，\n這個問題先放一放吧。=...Well, I have no conclusive evidence. \nForget I mentioned it.
不過這麼一來，{{A}}的扭曲程度，\n是不是稍微能緩解一點了？=Anyways, {{A}}'s warped desire is better now, right?
再去{{A}}的時候，\n{{B}}會不會就消失了啊。=I wonder if the {{B}} is gone.
不太可能，\n如果是{{A}}一個人的{{B}}還好說……=That's not likely. If {{A}} were the sole ruler, perhaps...
但那裡可是交織著兩人份的扭曲慾望，\n{{B}}寄生在{{A}}中。=But that Palace represents the convergence of two individual's desires, with {{B}} acting as a parasite.
不過……{{A}}裡可能會發生什麼變化，\n等這幾天重整架勢，再攻略看看吧。=Still... the {{A}} itself has likely changed. Once we've made our preparations, let's put our plan in motion.
好像，剛才有誰在看這邊……=I felt eyes on us just now...
好了，差不多該回去了，\n為了防止你們亂跑，我們一起走到車站吧。=Well, we should head home. Let's walk to the station together to avoid getting distracted with unnecessary pitstops.
{{B}}！不愧是{{A}}！={{B}}! As expected from {{A}}!
好奇心旺盛的少女=Curious Girl

----------
Chapter 3 Part 2 Palace Start
----------
那，今天有什麼打算？\n吾想去確認一下，{{A}}是否發生變化……=So, what's the plan for today? I would like to check on {{A}}, but...
不過是否立刻去{{A}}，\n就交給你這個隊長判斷了。=It's up to your judgement, Leader.
啊，我們好像很自然地就把{{A}}叫上了……=Hey guys, we've been using {{A}}'s real name here, but...
這麼說{{A}}、\n今後也是「{{B}}的一員」了吧？=Isn't {{A}} a Phantom Thief now?
我是這麼打算的……\n可以批准嗎，隊長？=I would hope so, but... Is it all right with our leader?
謝謝，那，今後請大家多關照。=Thank you. It's an honor to work together.
唔，透過之前的戰鬥吾對你的能力有所了解，\n而且你腦子很聰明，人也十分機靈。=The honor is ours. In addition to proving yourself more than capable in battle, you also possess a sharp intellect.
如果不嫌棄，要不要成為{{A}}的大腦……\n擔任作戰參謀呢？=How would you like to act as the {{A}}' brain and chief strategist?
說起來，我們還真沒有一個參謀呢。=Oh yeah, we could use one of those.
作戰參謀……感覺好帥啊！\n越來越像{{A}}了啊～！=Ooh, Chief Strategist? That sounds so cool! We're startin' to seem pretty legit, huh?
參謀……我能行嗎？="Strategist"...? Am I really qualified for that?
{{A}}都不行的話，那沒人能行了！\n我可以保證！=You're the only one qualified, {{A}}!\nYou've got my vote!
來自CLOSER的認證有說服力嗎……=Not like your vote counts for much, Closer...
這話唯獨不想聽到SOY你說啊～=That would be hurtful coming from anyone but you, Soy.
……{{A}}，我知道了，\n那{{B}}的作戰參謀工作，我就接受了。=...{{A}}, very well. I'll assume the role of the {{B}}' Chief Strategist.
關於……CLOSER或者SOY的叫法，\n大家互相之間都是這樣以代號稱呼的嗎？=On that note, everyone calls each other by code names here, like "Closer" and "Soy," right?
啊，差點忘了！\n也得給{{A}}想個代號！=Oh yeah, I forgot! You haven't picked a code name yet!
WONDER，CATTLE，CLOSER，SOY……\n大家都是怎麼決定代號的呢？=Wonder, Cattle, Closer, Soy... How did you all decide on your names?
我們是按照，\n各自覺得「不可思議的東西」來取的。=We each chose something we think is strange or mysterious.
{{A}}你有沒有什麼覺得不可思議的東西啊？=Anythin' come to mind, {{A}}?
不可思議的東西？我想想……=Something mysterious? Let's see...
風……「WIND」怎麼樣？=What about "Wind"?
WIND……？啊，好聽？這個好！=Wind...? Ooh, I love it!
不過，為什麼你會覺得「風」不可思議呢？=But what is it you find mysterious about wind?
我有想過「{{A}}」中「風紀」的用法，\n為什麼會使用『風』這個字呢。=I've always wondered why the word for "Disciplinary Committee" uses the kanji for wind.
「風情」「風物」「風土」……\n凡是和文化相關，這個漢字就用的很多……=The same character appears in many words relating to the core values of a culture or the characteristics of a region.
是指代現場的氛圍嗎，還是說，\n有一種隨風而來的印象呢……我一直不明白。=Is that because it pertains to the feeling or "air" of a particular locality? It's hard to be sure.
{{A}}～腦子好使的人，\n還真是會關注些莫名其妙的地方啊……={{A}}～ Smart people think about the weirdest things.
不過很適合你=It suits you
WINK如何？=How about "Wink"?
是，是嗎？嗯……也不是說非要弄明白，\n只是這種點讓我覺得很不可思議。=Is it really that weird? Well... I haven't done any proper research or anything. It just struck me as odd.
啊……不會是因為，\n你覺得和WIND這個單詞很像吧！？=What does wink have to do with anything?\nOther than kind of rhyming...
這……\n眨眼……倒沒覺得有什麼不可思議的……=Hmmm... Wink doesn't feel all that mysterious.
要是真用這個單詞做代號……\n怎麼感覺會不停眨眼啊……=And with a code name like that, \nit sounds like you just blink a lot...
我覺得WIND很好啊！\n輕快又清新的感覺，太適合{{A}}了！=Wind is a great name! It's light, refreshing, and fits you to a T!
而且跟{{B}}的{{A}}感覺也很搭呢！=It matches your {{A}} too!
嗯……{{A}}從能力上來說，\n以輔助大家戰鬥為主。=Yes... Taking {{A}}'s abilities into account, I believe I could serve best in a support role.
對夥伴而言，就是順風，對敵人則是逆風，\n我想要像這樣幫助各位。=I wish to be the wind at my allies' backs and a cyclone against my foes.
那就定了，\n從現在開始，你就是「WIND」。=Excellent. Then you'll henceforth be known as "Wind."
那，在這裡……也要叫WIND{{A}}嗎？=Uh, should we call you Wind-senpai here?
不需要叫我{{A}}，\n希望你們以後不用再對我說敬語了。=You can drop "senpai." I'd like everyone to speak to me casually going forward.
我才是{{A}}的新人，\n而且每一個成員都是平等的吧？=As a Phantom Thief, I'm the newcomer here. And as allies, we're all equals, are we not?
也對，那……就{{A}}了，WIND！=Oh, okay then! Welcome to the team, Wind!
{{A}}啊，WIND=Welcome, Wind
期待你的表現=We're counting on you
嗯，{{A}}，WONDER。\n那我們就出發吧。=Yes, it's wonderful to work with you, Wonder. Well then, shall we be off?

{{A}}？這是怎麼了……\n跟之前，完全不一樣了啊！？=What the heck!? \nThis place looks totally different!
水壩的水，變少了……！=The water level is lower...!
正如WIND所猜測的那樣，這個{{C}}，\n是由{{A}}的{{B}}產生能量的水壩……=It seems just as Wind surmised, this {{C}} is a dam powered by {{A}}'s {{B}}...
水壩裡的水，\n正是{{A}}的{{B}}或者負面感情。=Which would make this reservoir a manifestation of her {{B}} and other negative emotions building up.
也就是說，在現實裡的這些情感消散了……\n水壩的水也相應地減少了吧？=So, the dam is drying up now that we've resolved those feelings in the real world?
唔，證實你的想法已經傳遞給了{{A}}吧。=Yes. It's proof that your feelings reached {{A}}.
那麼，\n首先找一下{{A}}的位置所在吧。=Now, let us hunt for the {{A}}.

{{A}}氣息離這裡很近，\n從那個方向可以感覺到。={{A}} is surprisingly close.\nI sense it in that direction.
幸好水都沒了，\n這樣可以直接走過去了。=Looks like we can go that way now that the water level is lower.
{{A}}……你再等一下，\n我們這就來救你！={{A}}... We'll save you. \nJust hang on a bit longer!
優先確認{{A}}的路線吧。=We should prioritize finding {{A}}.
WONDER，\n現在不是探索無關緊要地方的時候，=This is no time to be checking every nook and cranny, Wonder.

這部電梯好像已經沒法運轉了。=Looks like this elevator's not moving.
那要怎麼下去啊？=So how're we supposed to go down?
看來只能把電梯機廂當作平臺\n往下跳了。=We may be able to jump down using that cargo.
也是，這點距離也不是做不到。\n不過，萬一電梯突然運作起來的話……=From this height? Well, I can probably manage that, but what do we do if the elevator suddenly starts movin' again?
那將十分危險呢。\n謹慎前進吧。=That would be extremely dangerous. \nLet's do this carefully.
看起來沒事呢……\n有點提心吊膽的=Made it down safely... Phew, I was sweatin' back there.
似乎能從這裡鑽進去。=It seems we can enter from here.
潛入通風口什麼的，還真是怪盜的風格呢。\n難得的機會，這次就由我先進入吧。=Going through the ducts is a very Phantom Thief-like method. Since I've made it this far, allow me to go first.
不不不！\n這種時候就讓男生們走前面吧！=Nope, no way! At times like these, let the boys take the lead!

{{A}}的氣息已經很近了……而且……=I sense the {{A}} nearby...\nAnd something else...
我還感覺到強烈的陰影氣息，\n應該是{{A}}……=A powerful Shadow. It must be {{A}}...
{{A}}似乎就在這裡的上層，走吧。=It seems the {{A}} is higher above us.\nLet's keep going upward.
就是這裡……吾感受到了{{A}}的氣息。=I feel it... The {{A}} is here.
那{{A}}……也在這吧。=And... {{A}} is too.
你來了啊，{{A}}。={{A}}, I'm glad you're here.
r:"^(.*)，(.*)，\n還有(.*)同學……$"="And you three as well. $1, $2, $3-kun..."
你沒事吧，{{A}}！我們……=Are you okay, {{A}}!? Wait...
{{A}}，你知道我們是誰……=How'd you know it was us?
我當然知道，\n因為我是你們的……{{A}}啊。=Of course I know. I'm your teacher after all.
你們，是來取這個的吧？=You're here for this, right?
那是……{{A}}！？=The {{A}}!?
為什麼{{A}}就出現了？=Why can we see it?
那就是{{A}}……！=That's {{A}}...!
{{B}}，但為什麼現在就出現了？\n我們還沒有發出{{A}}啊？=But how is it visible? We didn't send out a calling card, did we?
啊，對，怎麼就出現了？\n明明還沒有發出{{A}}啊……=Yeah, how is it visible already? We didn't even send out a calling card yet...
{{A}}的目的，\n是讓當事人意識到慾望「要被奪走」這一點。=A calling card's purpose is to alert the person that their Treasure will be stolen.
恐怕是吾等去酒吧的時候，\nWIND對{{A}}說的話……=If I had to guess, what Wind said to {{A}} in that bar...
那句話，\n大概發揮了和{{A}}同樣的效果吧。=It must have had the same effect as a calling card.
你們是來拿這個的對嗎？=You came for this, didn't you?
雖然它對我來說是重要的東西……\n不過你們拿走吧。=It's dear to me, but go on, take it.
{{A}}……可以嗎！？={{A}}... Really!?
嗯，當然。=Yes, it's fine.
可……那對{{A}}來說，\n是很重要的慾望吧……？=But, it's {{A}}'s most precious desire, isn't it?
如果我們把這個奪走的話……\n最壞的情況，或許你就不想繼續當{{A}}了……=If we steal it, and the worst happens... you might not want to be a teacher anymore.
這個，是一本講不良教師的漫畫，\n以前很流行呢，可以說是我的聖經吧。=This is a manga about a delinquent teacher that was popular back in my day. It's my Bible.
我啊，以前還是不良少女的時候，\n有位{{A}}救了我……=I was a wild child then, but there was a certain teacher that saved me from myself...
我也想要像那位{{A}}一樣……\n成為那種能好好面對學生的熱血教師。=I admired them so much, I aspired to be a passionate teacher like that. Someone who faces their students head-on.
我是真的這麼想的……=Those feelings were real, but...
但是……也有可能我只是在扮演熱血教師，\n只是沉迷那樣的自己而已。=Somewhere along the line, I became hooked on playing the hot-blooded teacher.
現在，我想重來一次……\n拋開那些念想，好好地去面對學生們。=So I want to start over... Forget about acting like a hero, and actually try to meet my students where they're at.
所以……你們拿走它吧。=So go on, take it.
……不能辜負{{A}}的想法，\n我們偷走它吧，WONDER。=...We can't disregard her feelings. \nLet's steal it, Wonder.
{{A}}，請你醒過來吧……！={{A}}, please, wake up...!
為什麼……會這樣……=Why...? Why did this happen...!?
{{A}}……這不是真的吧……？={{A}}... This can't be real...
都是因為……被注入了那個「力量」……現在、恐怕已經……=All because that power was sent into her...\nNow it's too...
不要啊～～！！=Nooooo～～!!
……怎麼了，WONDER？=...What's wrong, Wonder?
你，該不會……=Don't tell me...
又「看到了」嗎？=You "saw" something again, didn't you?
……！\n這個氣息，難道是！=...! This aura... It's...!
好了好了，差不多了吧！\n就到此為止哦～{{A}}～！=All right, all right. That's enough! \nWrap it up～ {{A}}～!

Katayama Boss Video
這個聲音是=That voice!
{{A}}嗎={{A}}?
在哪裡=...Where?
現在誰都不想看催淚的校園題材了  到底要我說幾次啊=I already told you people. No one wants to see your tearful coming-of-age drama.
給我出來  {{A}}  你這個  卑鄙小人=Show yourself, {{A}}! You... You coward!
{{A}}  振作一點={{A}}! Hang on!
大眾所期待的是暴力  是讓人{{A}}的悲劇=The people want violence! Shock value!
接下來就有請  {{A}}為我們帶來單方面的殺戮表演吧= The {{A}}'s about to star in her very own slaughter show!
喂  怎麼變成這樣了=What's happening to her!?
{{A}}  怎麼會這樣={{A}}... No...
陰影被「強制」暴走了  各位  做好準備=He's forcing her Shadow to go berserk! Everyone, get ready!

Katayama Boss
----------
我是「{{A}}」……=I am the {{A}}...
{{A}}的「{{B}}」慾望在不斷增加……\n那個電纜在注入某種力量。={{A}}'s wrathful desires are being amplified... That cable is injecting some kind of power into her.
那翅膀上……好像是眼睛……=Her wings... Are those eyes?
混蛋！居然把{{A}}變成這個樣子……！=Bastard! How could you do this to {{A}}...!?

{{A}}，那眼睛的光是不是變淡了？=Hey, did that eyeball just get dimmer?
攻擊了我們之後，光變淡了……\n那些光可能<color\=#ff0000>代表著{{A}}的力量的變化</color>。=After it attacked us, the light became weaker... It seems to reflect <color\=#ff0000>her remaining power level</color>.
唔，似乎{{A}}每發洩一次「{{B}}」進行攻擊，\n眼睛的光芒就會減弱，不過……=Hm... As {{A}} releases her {{B}} through those attacks, the light in the eyes grows faint. However...
那個力量恐怕是<color\=#ff0000>會持續恢復</color>的，\n眼睛的光越亮，{{A}}的力量也就越強。=She will likely <color\=#ff0000>recover</color> before too long. If the light gets stronger, her attacks will likely intensify as well.
正是如此，吾等注意應對。=Seems so. Let's keep that in mind.

不要……我不要傷害學生啊……=No... I won't hurt...my students...
慾望……{{A}}的{{B}}之力消失了……？={{A}}'s desire... \nHas the power of her {{B}} subsided...?
那、是恢復理智了嗎！？=Then is she back to her old self!?
{{A}}，喂，{{A}}！={{A}}! Hey, {{A}}!
看樣子，雖然不會攻擊我們，\n但也聽不到我們的聲音……=She's not attacking, but I don't think she hears us either...
她在依靠自己抑制著慾望，\n真是強悍的精神力量啊……！=She's suppressing her own desire. \nWhat astounding mental fortitude...!
但不知道可以堅持多久，\n趁現在調整一下吧！=Still, I don't know how long she can hold out. Let's take this chance to regroup!

{{A}}，怎麼回事！你到底在幹什麼！\n趕緊把這些傢伙幹掉！=Ugh, come on already! \nWhat do you think you're doing!? Kill them!
給我快點釋放你的{{A}}！盡情破壞吧！=Unleash your rage! Let it burn!
不要……不要啊……！！=No... Nooooo...!
那傢伙……\n又在把那個奇怪的力量輸送給{{A}}！=He's using that weird power on her again!
不妙，{{A}}的{{B}}在增長……=This isn't good. He's amplifying her anger...
照這樣被強制注入力量的話，\n現實中{{A}}的精神可能會承受不住！=If that surge of power persists, \n{{A}}'s mind won't survive!
弄不好，會變成廢人……\n不，可能會失去生命！=One wrong move and she could be permanently injured... She may even lose her life!
我<color\=#ff0000>之前</color>看到的是……醫院裡，\n失去意識的{{A}}即將死去……=I had that <color\=#ff0000>vision</color> of {{A}} unconscious in the hospital on the verge of death...
<color\=#ff0000>當時的我說過，這都是……\n「因為被注入了那個力量」……</color>=<color\=#ff0000>"All because that power was sent into her..."</color>
阻止那個「力量」=I'll cut off the power
切斷電纜=I'll cut the cable
是想從根本上解決問題嗎……\n就是說，解決掉{{A}}！？=Cut the power...? \nYou mean beat {{A}}!?
可是{{A}}一直躲著，完全不露面啊！\n我們該怎麼解決他啊！？=But he's hiding somewhere! \nHow are we supposed to stop him!?
那麼……\n只能切斷那些電纜了。=In that case... our only option is to cut the cable.
啊……！只要被注入了那個力量，\n那無論怎麼戰鬥都是徒勞……=Of course! No matter how much we fight,\nas long that energy source persists...
{{A}}還是會恢復、\n繼而被迫戰鬥下去……！={{A}} will be revived and forced to do battle...!
那只要切斷那些電纜，\n就能脫離{{A}}的力量吧！=If we cut that cable, we can free her from {{A}}'s control!
不對，等一下！即使切斷了一批，\n只要又被接上新的電纜，問題依舊存在。=No, wait! Even if you cut it, the cycle will repeat if Akashi connects a new cable.
可是，那該怎麼辦……！=Then what do we do...!?
隊長，給我點時間，\n我一定會推導出……拯救{{A}}的方法！=Give me time, leader. I promise I'll find a way to save {{A}}!
好的，靠你了=<size\=26>Okay, we're counting on you</size>
我們幫你爭取時間！=<size\=29>We'll buy you some time!</size>
嗯，再堅持一會兒！=Okay! Just hold out for a little!
爭取時間對吧……這個單我接了！\n靠你了，WIND！=One order of Grade A stalling, comin' right up! Countin' on ya, Wind!
等著我們，{{A}}……！=Please hold on, {{A}}...!

我是個「廢物」……=I'm useless...
啊……{{A}}，我要再盡責一點……=Ah... Arghh... I... have to keep it together...
那個紅光……！不妙，\n{{A}}的力量到達頂峰了！各位注意應對！=That red light... This is bad! Her {{A}} has reached its peak! Everyone, get ready!
哇，{{A}}周圍有像盾牌一樣的東西！=Whoa, there's some kind of shield around {{A}}!
豎起護盾，似乎是要累積更多的「{{A}}」……=It seems like she's trying to build up her {{A}} while the shield is up...
首先<color\=#ff0000>摧毀那個護盾</color>吧！=Then we need to <color\=#ff0000>destroy that shield</color> first!

{{A}}！怎麼又這樣！\n身為暴徒卻躲著不出來……可不像你哦！？=What!? Again!? Enough with the turtle act!\nWe all know you're a raging bull!
拿出點{{A}}的樣子，狠狠蹂躪學生吧！！=Now let me see you stampede your students!
不要……不要……不要啊……！\n{{A}}！！=No... No, no...! AAAAAAGH!!
我不想要……傷害學生啊！！=I'll never hurt my students... Never!
推導……完畢！=Analysis... complete!
大家，注意那些翅膀上的眼睛！\n就是它們在吸收來自電纜的力量！=Everyone, look at the eyes on those wings!\nThey're absorbing power from the cable!
竟然是眼睛……！？原來如此，\n如果是那個在承擔「容器」作用的話……！=Eyes!? Oh, I see! If those are absorbing the energy, then...!
破壞翅膀上的眼睛！=Aim for the eyes!
一定要幫到{{A}}！=<size\=29>We'll save them for sure!</size>
收到！=Got it!

搞定一個了！=That's one down!
WIND的推導是正確的。\n{{A}}的力量在下降，但只是這樣……=It's just as Wind suspected. \n{{A}}'s power is weakening. But...
嗯，還是不夠，\n拖延下去只會對我們不利。=It's still not enough. \nWe can't let this drag on too long.
那就速戰速決！=Then let's finish this up quick, then!
離{{A}}<color\=#ff0000>最近的那２個眼球</color>，\n剛才明明不能攻擊的……=Those <color\=#ff0000>two eyes</color> closest to her haven't really done anything up until now...
那是電纜連線的核心位置，\n可以利用這個破綻……！=That's the connection point for the cable.\nThis is our opening...!
事不宜遲，拿下吧！=Time to finish this!
<color\=#ff0000>{{A}}……我來救您了！</color>=<color\=#ff0000>{{A}}... I'm going to set you free!</color>

{{A}}，這個沒用的廢物！\n那位大人的「力量」也沒什麼了不起的嘛……=Tch, you're utterly useless! That person's power turned out to be a disappointment, too...
那個混蛋……！=That bastard...!
{{A}}，振作一點！{{A}}！={{A}}! Can you hear me!? {{A}}!
CATTLE，這是……！？=What's happening, Cattle...!?
唔……看起來，應該沒什麼大礙。=Ah... I think she'll be fine.
讓{{A}}扭曲的那個異常力量也消失了，\n她已經不再失控了。=That strange power which transformed {{A}} is gone, and she's no longer in a frenzy.
陰影消失的話，\n應該就會回到現實中{{A}}的內心……=If her Shadow disappears, it should return to the real {{A}}...
真的嗎……？那就沒問題了吧！？=Really...? She'll be okay, right!?
嗯，幸好WONDER和WIND隨機應變，\n否則後果不堪設想……=Yes. Things could've been much worse if not for Wonder and Wind's quick thinking...
就現狀而言，現實中{{A}}不會有生命危險了，\n而且也不會留下什麼後遺症。=But as it stands, the real {{A}} won't suffer any ill repercussions.
大家……給你們添麻煩了……對不起……=Everyone... I'm sorry... for everything...
我是……這樣一個{{A}}……對不起……=You deserve... a better teacher...
沒那回事！=That's not true!
你拯救了我和學生們的內心，\n是一位優秀的{{A}}……！=You're a wonderful teacher who protects all of her students, including me...!
學校見，{{A}}=<size\=25>Come back to school, {{A}}</size>
謝謝……你們看著我哦……\n我會，重新再去做一次……=Thank you... I'm going to be better from now on...
我一定會回到……\n我最喜歡的、有你們……在的學校裡……=I promise to return to school... and to you, my precious students.
這就是{{A}}……=So this is {{A}}...
{{C}}，本來{{A}}都把{{B}}給我們了……=Damn it. {{A}} tried to hand it over herself too...
要不是{{B}}跑出來，\n我們根本就不用跟{{A}}戰鬥！=If {{B}} hadn't shown up, \nwe wouldn't have had to fight her!
嗯……！而且，走錯一步的話，\n{{A}}可能連命都沒了啊！=Yeah! And if we'd made even the tiniest mistake, she could've died!
自己偷偷摸摸躲起來、操縱{{B}}……！\n{{A}}……絕對不能原諒他！=And that coward {{A}}... Controlling her while hiding himself away! I'll never forgive him!
……{{A}}？發生什麼事了？怎麼了嗎？=Huh? Uh... What just happened?
應該是{{A}}消失之後，\n水壩的動力源不足了吧。=With {{A}} gone, the dam must be low on power.
所以就停電了啊？\n哎呀不管怎麼說，現在先追上{{A}}那混蛋。=That explains the outage. Anyway, let's head after Aka-shit.
警告，水壩失去了可供利用的能量來源。=Warning. Dam energy supply depleted.
目前判定為緊急狀態，\n10分鐘後所有門將會上鎖。=Initiating emergency protocol. \nAll doors will be locked in ten minutes.
啊，這又是搞什麼啊！=Whoa, whoa, what!?
剛是不是說……\n10分鐘後所有的門都會上鎖？=All the doors... will lock in ten minutes?
因為{{A}}消失了？=Because {{A}}'s gone?
因為沒有能量了……=<size\=21>Because there's no energy source...</size>
原來如此……！{{A}}，\n是個只會寄生他人陰影中的弱小存在……！=Oh...! {{A}} is weak and can only feed off other Shadows...!
在他找到新的動力源，就是能榨取的人之前，\n他打算先封鎖這個{{A}}！=Until he finds a new host to exploit, he plans to keep the {{A}} on lockdown!
什麼意思啊……？=What do you mean...?
就是說，在{{B}}找到像{{A}}那樣的、\n下一個犧牲者之前……=In other words, until {{B}} finds another victim to fill {{A}}'s place...
我們都無法進入{{B}}，\n也沒法奪走{{A}}，是這樣吧？=We won't be able to enter the {{B}} or steal {{A}}?
正是如此。=Precisely.
啊！？那豈不是，\n只能立刻把{{A}}奪過來了？=What!? Then we gotta steal his {{A}} right now!
嗯！那就必須在{{A}}找到下個目標前，\n讓他悔改才行……！=Yeah! We have to change {{A}}'s heart before more people get hurt...!
……你們冷靜點，\n還剩１０分鐘，奪取{{A}}是不現實的。=...Calm down. That will be impossible to do in only ten minutes.
{{A}}很狡猾……他必然會警惕我們的動向，\n盲目去追他，反而有可能落入他的陷阱。={{A}} is crafty, and he's already wary of us. If we chase him blindly, we might end up walking into a trap.
另外，如果不趕緊離開{{A}}，\n我們這輩子就只能困在這裡了。=Besides, if we don't escape now, \nwe'll be trapped in this {{A}} forever.
雖然不甘心……=I hate to say it...
還是先逃出去再說=<size\=30>We need to leave ASAP</size>
……可惡！=Damn...!
{{A}}那個混蛋，真是個懦夫，卑鄙！=That fuckin' scumbag! \nWay to bring chickenshit to a new level!
可……{{A}}要怎麼辦？=Should we at least bring back {{A}}?
唔，別急，{{A}}也先保持原樣吧。=No, let's leave it here for now.
{{A}}，為什麼！？={{A}}, why!?
如果失去{{B}}，\n{{A}}有可能會開始崩塌。=Without her {{B}} inside, the {{A}} may start to collapse.
那樣的話，\n可能連奪取{{A}}的手段都失去了。=And if that happens, we won't be able to steal {{A}}.
對……雖然不甘心，但這次先撤退吧。=Yes... You're right. I know it's frustrating,\nbut let's retreat for now.
CATTLE，拜託你了。=Cattle, if you don't mind.
{{B}}……你的{{A}}，\n我們一定會回來偷走的……！={{B}}... I promise we'll come back for your {{A}}!

太好了，總算回來了……=Thank god. We managed to make it back somehow.
哼，{{A}}那個混蛋……！=Damn that bastard {{A}}!
沒辦法，\n要是吾等被埋在那裡的話，那就真的……=We had no choice. If we had allowed ourselves to be trapped there...
徹底失去了讓{{A}}悔改的方法，\n他就可以永遠逍遙法外。=Any chance to change {{A}}'s heart would have been lost, and he would be left to roam free forever.
至少，這次{{A}}看起來，\n已經找到了對生的希望。=Besides, it seems {{A}} has found a new lease on life.
雖然不至於到悔改的程度……但是，\n{{A}}的慾望應該不會再被{{B}}奪走了。=It's not quite a change of heart, but {{B}} can no longer steal {{A}}'s desire.
……這樣就好，\n我們先整理一下思路吧。=That's true. Then shall we switch gears?
下一個目標，\n雖然是要確認{{A}}路線……=Our next objective is to secure a route to {{A}}, but...
但是現在所有的門都上鎖了，\n{{A}}處於戒嚴狀態，這個目標就很難達成了。=It will be no easy task since the doors are locked and he's hypervigilant of intruders.
那，我們該怎麼辦？=Then what do we do?
……唔，{{A}}如果找到新的「動力源」，\n也許{{B}}的警戒度也會下降。=Hoom... If {{A}} finds a new power source, the {{B}}'s security might ease up.
可你說的那個動力源，應該要……=But by "power source," you mean...
要跟{{A}}一樣，\n必須是「被{{B}}榨取負面感情的人類」……=A human, whose negative emotions {{B}} can exploit just like {{A}}.
那可不行，就算是為了攻略{{A}}，\n也不能傻傻等著下一個犧牲者出現啊！=There's no way we're waiting for another person to fall victim just so we can raid the {{A}}!
我們不就是為了不再有人犧牲，\n才決心讓{{A}}悔改嗎！=The whole point of changing his heart is so no one else gets hurt!
所以才當怪盜=<size\=21>That's why we're Phantom Thieves</size>
的確是有些本末倒置了，唔……\n那要如何攻略完全被封鎖的{{A}}呢……=I agree it's putting the cart before the horse... but how are we to siege a sealed {{A}}?
……下一個犧牲者，嗎。=The next victim, huh?
或許是……有辦法的。=We have... multiple options.
隊長，這件事能不能先交給我？=Leader, may I handle this matter?
我有些想法。\n但我需要時間斟酌一下。=I have an idea and would like time to devise a strategy.
你想到了什麼？=An idea?
嗯，我打算……=Yes. This time...
這次，就由我們給{{A}}布下陷阱。=...we'll lure {{A}} into a trap.
……怎麼了，在想什麼？=What is it? Is something on your mind?
今天你也累了吧，早點休息比較好。=You must be exhausted from today. \nI suggest we turn in early.
沒能讓{{A}}=<size\=25>Didn't {{A}}</size>
沒能奪取{{A}}=<size\=23>Couldn't steal {{A}}</size>
嗯……的確，\n今天的工作成果吾也並不十分滿意。=Yes... I agree today's mission left much to be desired.
不過，{{A}}從那個{{B}}得到了解放，\n現實的她，精神上應該也得到了拯救。=Still, {{A}} left the {{B}}, and the real Katayama was saved.
機會一定還會出現的，\n現在應該做好準備，養精蓄銳。=We will have another chance. For now, your next mission is to steal yourself some sleep.
……好的=Fine...
但應該先做好準備=But I need to prepare
你的情緒顯然還是很低落啊，\n嗯，別太過煩惱了。=You're clearly crestfallen, but worry not.
關於對付{{B}}的計畫，\n{{A}}不是說她會考慮作戰嗎？={{A}} said she'll devise a strategy to deal with {{B}}, did she not?
現在就交給她，\n吾等就盡力去做好吾等力所能及的事情。=For now, let's have faith in her and simply do what we can.
嗯，整頓配備，加強鍛煉……\n在{{A}}外能做的事情還有很多。=Yes, there is lots to do outside the {{A}}, such as readying equipment and honing our skills.
對策方面就交給{{A}}了，\n吾等就盡力去做好吾等力所能及的事情。=Leave the strategizing to {{A}} and let us just do what we can.
{{B}}，一直這幅慘兮兮的樣子，\n隊長的位置可能就會被{{A}}奪走哦？=Hoohoom, if you keep looking so defeated, {{A}} may have to take your place as leader.
{{B}}，一直這幅慘兮兮的樣子，\n隊長的位置可能就會被{{A}}奪走哦！=Hoohoom, if you keep looking so defeated, {{A}} may have to take your place as leader.

雖然這看上去有些理所當然……\n不過這可不是每個人都能做到的，自信點。=It may be obvious to me, but you should know, not just anyone could manage that. Hold your head high.

如果有人成為了動力源，\n那應該是在「發電廠」……=If someone has become the new energy source, they're most likely at the "power plant"...
就是放著{{A}}{{C}}的地方，\n我有點擔心{{B}}……過去看看情況吧。=The same place where we left {{A}}'s {{C}}. We should go make sure it's all right.
這怎麼回事……進不去啊。=What the—!? It's locked?
噓！\n有人來了，快躲起來。=Shhh! Someone's coming. Hide.
發電廠關閉了沒事可做啊……\n不過能閒下來了，這倒也不錯。=There's nothin' to do with the plant shut down, but it's nice havin' some downtime.
嗯，如果沒有女{{A}}那樣的「動力源」，\n我們什麼也幹不了……=Well, it's hardly a plant without a power source like that teacher lady.
趁現在稍微歇歇吧，\n等恢復運行 ，我們又該忙起來了。=Let's kick back while we can. \nThings will get busy once it starts back up.
是啊，{{A}}還隱居在發電廠那邊，\n沒出來過呢。=You're right. {{A}} hasn't even come out here since holing himself up on the other side of the plant.
趁著這段時間那幫挑事的傢伙沒來，\n我們也歇歇吧～=While the cat is away, the mice will play!
看起來，\n目前還沒有人被抓來當成新的動力源。=It doesn't seem like he's caught a new power source yet.
聽起來{{A}}還藏在那啊，\n那個膽小的混蛋……！=So Akashi's hidin' up ahead, huh?\nThat little chickenshit!
只要發電廠的封鎖沒有解除，\n吾等很難進行更進一步的探索。=It will be difficult to search as long as the power plant is on lockdown.
最好先回現實世界，\n先制定如何進入發電廠的計畫吧。=Our only option is to return to the real world and find a way to unlock the plant from there.
嗯，這件事就交給我。=Yes, please leave that to me.
是回去還是繼續探索其他地方……\n就交給你判斷了，隊長。=Whether we stay or head back to the real world is up to you, Leader.

不過，我也是因為這點才一直跟隨他。=Well, that's exactly why I followed him.
啊，那{{A}}果然……\n是為了引誘{{B}}現身的圈套吧……！？=Ah, then {{A}} really... \nWas a trap to lure out the {{B}}...!?
喔……居然已經推測到這個地步了。\n好吧，作為獎勵，我就告訴你們。=Oh... You actually guessed that far. \nFine, as a reward, I'll tell you.
沒錯，{{A}}和{{B}}，\n都是為了調查你們而設下的「餌食」。=That's right, both the {{A}} and the {{B}} were "bait" to identify you.
你這混蛋……\n不許把{{A}}叫做什麼「餌食」！=You... \nYou are not allowed to call {{A}} "bait"!
SOY，不要被他煽動。\n他是為了動搖我們才那麼說的。=Soy, don't fall for his words. \nWe should stay calm.
{{A}}，你們真的……很煩人啊……\n為什麼不乖乖上鉤，來糾纏我做什麼……！={{A}}, you are very annoying... Why don't you just take the bait instead of bothering me...!
我才不會被吃掉，我才是吃人的一方！=I'm not the one being eaten, \nI will stay on the eating side!
少得意忘形了=Don't get carried away
不存在被吃的一方=No side is being eaten
……不，你錯了，\n這個世界上是存在弱者的。=...No, that's not true. \nThere are clearly weak people in this world.
只不過，區分強者還是弱者的標準……\n不是權力，不是金錢，也不是暴力。=But what separates the strong from the weak... \nIs not power, money, or violence.
而是是否擁有「吞噬」他人的意志，\n這一點很重要哦。=It's whether or not you have the will to "devour" others. That's what's important.
{{A}}你在胡說什麼啊！={{A}} What are you talking about!
啊！？你在胡說什麼啊！=Huh!? What are you talking about!
大眾都是一樣的哦。\n無時無刻不在想著怎麼吃人。=It's the same for the masses.\nAlways wanting to eat someone else.
撲到我為他們準備的名為「惡」的餌食上，\n譴責他人，並陶醉於正義的快感中。=They take the bait of "evil" I have prepared, condemn others, and revel in the pleasure of justice.
惡人有惡報的情節，大家都很喜歡吧？\n仿佛自己就站在了正義的一方！=Everyone loves it when evil is punished, right? \nThe illusion of being on the side of justice!
你們也是一樣……主觀上把我判定為惡人，\n將自身行為謳歌為正義，陷入自我陶醉………=You are the same... Singing about how wrong I am and how right you are, enjoying the incident...
你什麼意思……？=What do you mean...?
{{A}}……所以，你們才在當什麼{{B}}吧？={{A}}... That's why you became {{B}}, right?
不對、不是那樣的！=No, it's not like that!

哎呀，小孩還是太嫩了呀，\n看來沒意識到這是「錯誤的正義」嘛。=Ah, you really seem to be a bit slow. You don't even realize that this is a "false justice".

別誤會，\n我可不屬於被吃掉的那一方哦！=I don't want you to misunderstand, \nbut I'm not on the side of being eaten.
我很清楚，這個世界不是吃人就是被吃，\n跟「正確」和「強大」都沒有關係。=I know very well that the world is eat or be eaten, it has nothing to do with "righteousness" or "strength".
這傢伙……\n從剛才開始就在說什麼呢……？=What has this guy been saying all this time...?
小心，他在通過偷換概念進行心理誘導，\n這是詐騙犯常用的手法。=Be careful, changing the topic is a common tactic used by scammers to manipulate your psychology.
混淆概念、偷換論點，\n想讓我們產生錯覺，認為錯的是自己。=They're trying to change the subject, to shift the argument, to make you feel like you're in the wrong.

犧牲掉的人，被選為食物……\n大眾享用過他的下場後，就會感到滿足。=The sacrificed people were chosen as food... After the public has enjoyed their fate, they will feel satisfied.
然後他們就會讚美我，給我金錢和地位。\n而我就能盡情享用這一切。=Then they will praise me, give me money and status. And I can enjoy it all.
我可是食物鏈頂端的存在哦？\n這也意味著，在資本主義中，這就是正義！=I'm at the top of the food chain! \nThis is capitalist justice!
我可是食物鏈頂端的存在哦！\n這也意味著，在資本主義中，這就是正義！=I'm at the top of the food chain! \nThis is capitalist justice!

WIND……！=Wind...!
你說了那麼多大道理，\n但那只不過是自私利己的理論吧？=It may seem like a great principle, but what you say is just a selfish, self-centered theory.
你操縱大眾心理，獲得認同，\n只是沉醉於自己的主張而已。=You are just intoxicated by your claims, manipulating the psychology of the masses to gain their approval.
……其實你早已意識到自己是「錯誤的」，\n但你一直不敢正視這一點。=...You know what you're doing is "wrong", but you keep turning your eyes away from yourself.
你犧牲了那麼多人的人生，\n無論你怎麼捏造和誘導……=You have sacrificed the lives of many, no matter how much you fabricate and induce...
唯獨這個「事實」，是絕對不會改變的。=The "fact" remains unchanged.
……這、微小的犧牲，卻滿足多數人的需求，\n這不是最棒的娛樂嗎。=...It's a small sacrifice that will satisfy the many, isn't this the best entertainment?
微小的犧牲？\n你把人的生命和情感當什麼了。=It's a small sacrifice, you say? \nWhat do you think of people's lives and hearts?
你只是把自己受過的痛苦，\n又施加給他人而已。=You are just taking out your pain on others.
你明知被人吃掉的痛苦，卻成為吃人的一方，\n只會把錯歸咎於別人，真是幼稚……=Even though you know the pain of being eaten, you turned to the other side and take out your anger on others, how childish...
你……！=You...!
還說這跟人的強大無關？\n還要有吃掉別人的覺悟？全是胡說八道。=A person's strength doesn't matter? \nThey have the will to devour others? Nonsense.
當你面對「比自己強的人」時，\n你根本就不敢咬上去吧。=You simply can't hold your own against "someone stronger" than you.
不、不對……！=Wrong, wrong...!
哪裡不對，你全身被機械盔甲覆蓋的模樣，\n就是你自身軟弱的表現吧？=What's wrong. Covering yourself in mechanical armor, that's a sign of your own weakness.
你這種人，只會利用餌食引誘別人，\n自己好躲在暗中{{A}}地捕食……=People like you can only feed yourself by hiding and devouring others...
我不會再讓你吞噬人心了，\n也不會再讓你奪走別人的慾望！！=I will not let you devour others' hearts! \nI will not let you take away others' desires!!

哼！我就讓你們見識一下吞噬者的力量吧！\n就算那個女{{A}}沒派上用場……=Fine! I'll show you the power of the devourer! Even if that female teacher didn't work...
可是現在的我……有了新的動力源！=Now... I have a new source of power!
……嗯？電力供給怎麼了？\n搞什麼，發電廠什麼情況！？=...Huh? What happened to the power supply? \nWhat's going on at the Power Plant!?
喂，{{A}}他已經走了哦。=Yeah, the {{A}} is gone.
{{A}}的話，\n他早就回到自己的身體裡了哦～！={{A}} has already gone back to his body long ago～!
啊……！那個沒用的叛徒！！=Argh...! That useless traitor!!
果然沒有注意到嗎。\n看來收到吾等的預告後，內心相當動搖啊。=Apparently, he was quite upset by our Calling Card, he hadn't noticed.
……既然你想要吞噬我們的慾望，\n那就不要依賴他人，自己來怎麼樣？=...If you want to devour our desires, why not try it yourself instead of relying on others?
我來當你的對手=I'll be your opponent
哼！算了……這座水壩裡，\n應該還殘留著那個女人的「{{A}}」能量。=Hmph! Forget it... There should still be some leftover "{{A}}" energy from that woman.
我要使用全部動力……毀了你們！！！=I'll use all my energy... to destroy you all!!!

哼，只剩下這點能量了嗎……\n真是不省心啊。=Hmph, this is the only energy left...\nThat's annoying.
嗯，不過解決你們應該也夠用了。=Well, this should be enough to defeat you.
讓我來給你們好好指導吧。\n那麼，是誰這麼走運呢？=Let me give you a thorough consultation. \nWell then, who should I start with?
小心，{{A}}打算將我們逐個擊破。=Be careful, \n{{A}} is going to defeat us one by one.
WIND判斷的沒錯，\n被盯上的話，不要逞能，務必進行<color\=#FF0000>防禦</color>。=Wind is right. If you're targeted, \nyou have to <color\=#FF0000>guard</color> no matter what.
沒想到我還藏了這一手吧？\n{{A}}……力量再次湧入身體了呢~=You didn't expect this, right? \n{{A}}... I'm surging with power again～
如果讓他這樣攫取能量，\n我們沒有勝算……！=If we let him drain our energy, \nwe have no chance of winning...!

為什麼……不可能……明、明……\n我才是……吃人的吞噬者……=Why... Impossible... \nI'm the... Devourer...
錯的是你。=That way of thinking is wrong.
雖然我很同情你過去的遭遇……但反過來看，\n你應該比任何人都清楚成為犧牲品的痛苦。=While I sympathize with your past... But on the other hand, you should know the pain of being eaten better than anyone else.
為什麼你……沒有選擇去幫助他們，\n沒有站在遭受同樣痛苦的人的那一邊？=Why didn't... You redirect that to help the people who were hurting?
謬論，\n這只是你們這幫乳臭未乾的小鬼在妄想罷了。=That is just a fallacy, it is nothing more than an ideal that you young people often hold up.
人類是骯髒的……狡猾的……殘忍的……\n是一種最愛看他人不幸的生物哦。=Humans are dirty... Cunning... Evil... Creatures who desire misfortune of others above all else.
沒有那回事=That's not the case
你別擅自下結論=<size\=29>Don't jump to conclusions</size>
……你們說的，我一個字都不想聽。=...I don't want to hear a word you say.
因為「那個人」他說過……=Because "that person" said so...
回答吾，{{A}}！\n你說的「那個人」是誰！？=Answer me, {{A}}!\nWho is "that person" you're talking about!?
是誰把你送進{{A}}的……\n告訴我。=Who sent you to {{A}}...\nTell me.
……他是……=...He is...
{{A}}，剛才的聲音，哪裡來的！？={{A}}, what's that sound!?
喂……什麼東西……！？=Hey... What's that...!?
鯨……鯨魚……？=Wh-Whale...?
啊……我，啊這、這是……\n「這些傢伙」……不會是……=Ah... This is...\n"These guys"... It can't be...
怎麼會，這樣……\n你要，對我……不可能……！=Why... Are you doing... \nThis to me... Impossible...!

{{B}}……{{A}}……\n我是不會屈服於……那種東西的……={{B}}... {{A}}... I won't succumb to this...
要直接去威脅嗎……？\n還是，採取其他的手段……=Maybe I should threaten them...? \nOr, take other measures...
又是……{{A}}的推送……=Again... {{A}}'s notification...
不可……能……！=I-Impossible...
哈、{{A}}……我成了……官方認證？=Ha, {{A}}... I'm officially certified?
是惡作劇吧……一定是……\n快告訴我這不是真的……=This must be a prank... right... \nTell me it's not real...
喔唷，{{A}}更新官方的影片了啊！\n這不是今天早上剛發生的事嘛。=Oh, {{A}} uploaded an official video! Didn't this just happen this morning?
那個奇怪影片裡的人，\n已經被官方認定啦～就是那個……=The person in that strange video has been officially certified～ It's that...
{{A}}……京……={{A}}... Kei...
官方認證的{{A}}……又多了1個人……=Again... another officially certified {{A}}...

啊、啊……{{B}}……{{A}}……=Ah! Ah... {{B}}... {{A}}...
這到底……！=What...!
{{A}}……被襲擊了……！？={{A}}... Is under attack...!?
啊，這不是……！\n和{{A}}暴走的時候一樣……=Ah, isn't this...! Just like when {{A}} suddenly changed...
{{A}}的慾望……\n被那群陰影強制暴走了……！？={{A}}'s desires... were forced out of control by those Shadows...!?
{{B}}……{{A}}！！={{B}}... {{A}}!!
絕佳的力量啊……\n憎惡、怨恨、{{A}}……要溢出來了……！=What great power... Hatred... Resentment... {{A}}... Are overflowing...!
這什麼東西啊……也太大了吧！？=What happened to them...!!
人類慾望中的……負面情感……？\n{{A}}因此巨大化，連形態也變了嗎……！？=Is it the negative emotions... Of human desires...? \nThat caused {{A}} to grow and change...!?
我永遠都會是吞噬者！\n我會不停地吃、直到把一切都吞噬殆盡！=I will always be a devourer! I will eat and eat until I have devoured all!
正義，夢想，希望，還有愛，全部！\n吃掉對方的人才是贏家{{A}}！！=Justice, dreams, hope, and love, all of it! The winner is the one who eats the other!

吞噬一切……我會把你們都吃掉……=Devour all... I will devour you all...
一個不留！！=Leave nothing!!
{{A}}……這個混蛋，\n這個壓迫感和剛才完全不同了！={{A}}... This guy! \nthe pressure is totally different!
這種異常的破壞力……就算體型巨大化了，\n能量遲早也會被耗盡，他到底要做什麼……？=This abnormal destructive power... Even in this form, he would run out of energy soon. What is he trying...?
{{A}}，充滿了能量的材料～！\n這裡不就有一個嘛。={{A}}, food that is full of energy～! \nThere's one right here.
那什麼東西啊……\n又耍這種卑鄙的手段！=What's that...\nUsing dirty tricks again!
豈有此理，\n減員的話對吾等不利。=This is bad. It would be disadvantageous if our numbers were reduced.
再這樣下去，我們就會變成{{A}}的動力源！\n需要儘快擊破那個裝置！=If this continues, we will become {{A}}'s power source! We have to destroy that device quickly!
耶，成功了！\n我看你還能怎麼樣！=Yeah, we did it!\nNow you can't do that again!
{{A}}……竟敢妨礙我……！={{A}}... You dare to interfere...!

打贏了！？=Did we do it!?
還、沒有結束……我要，吞掉一切……\n為了讓那些……那些啃食我的人遭到報應……=It's... Not over... I will devour all...\nThose who ate me... Will pay...
啊，請再多給我些力量吧！\n我能在這，都是因為您啊。=Hey, please give me more power!\nYou've brought me this far.
難道您……難道您……\n連我也要吞噬掉嗎{{A}}！！=You... Are you... \nGoing to devour me too!!
{{B}}，{{C}}……{{A}}！={{B}}, {{C}}... {{A}}!
喂，怎麼回事啊！？\n他剛才明明都快不行了，怎麼突然就……！？=Hey, what's going on?! He was almost done for, why all of a sudden...!?
住手吧，{{A}}！\n再繼續放任陰影失控的話，你會沒命的！？=Stop it already, {{A}}! If you continue to let your Shadow go berserk, you yourself will die!?
{{A}}……你是在……關心我啊……？\n關心嗎……我才不相信，不會相信呢……={{A}}... Are you... Worried about me...? Worried... I don't believe it, I won't believe it...
這個世界上，只有吞噬者和被吞噬者……=In this world, there are only those who eat and those who are eaten...
因為相信別人……被看到自己弱點的話……\n就會被吞掉……會被那傢伙……還有她……=If you trust others... And showed your weakness... You will be eaten... by that guy... and her...
你錯了！=You're wrong!
你可以相信別人！=You can trust others!
嗯，說得好，WONDER！=Yes, that's right, Wonder!
雖然你的{{A}}和戀人……背叛了你……\n可是！=It is true that your {{A}} and lover... \nBetrayed you... But!
這個世界上並不都是那種人！還有那種……\n僅僅因為是自己的學生，僅僅是這個理由……=The world is not full of such people! There are also those... Who just because we are their student, just for that reason...
就拼命也要去保護對方的人存在！\n對你來說，一定也會有這樣的人！=They will desperately protect us!\nThere must be someone like that for you!
{{A}}……真是孩子氣的想法。\n幼稚得令人作嘔……={{A}}... What a childish idea.\nSo childish it's disgusting...
我啊，我已經……=For me, I...
什麼都不在乎了{{A}}……！\n因為我！已經！拋棄了所有！！=I don't care about anything anymore...! \nBecause! I've already! Thrown it all away!
吃掉吧吃掉吧吃掉吧！\n從他人身上奪走慾望，直到死亡！！=Eat, eat, eat! \nKeep taking away desires until death!
這、這是什麼情況……！？\n{{A}}怎麼突然……！=What's going on...!?\nWhy is {{A}} suddenly...!
這傢伙，該不會是……\n連自我都……「拋棄」了嗎……！？=This guy, it can't be...\nDid they even... "throw away" themself...!
吃掉吃掉全部都吃掉！\n我要把你們吃掉，一個都別想逃！=Eat, eat, eat, eat it all! \nI'm going to eat you all!
小心！那傢伙已經聽不進人話了……！\n他會無差別地奪走他人的生命！=Watch out! That guy won't listen to us anymore...! \nHe will take the lives of others without discrimination!
拋棄自我……奪走……他人的生命……？=Throwing away themself... \nTaking away... The lives of others...?
啊，怎麼了！？=Huh, what's wrong!?
那個是……{{A}}……？\n怎麼是那個樣子……！=Is that... {{A}}...? \nWhat's happening...!
{{A}}……！\n餌食來得正好啊！！={{A}}...!\nYou blocked a good spot!!
喂……！陰影被他給……！？=Hey...! The Shadows were...!?
被……吃掉了……！？\n大家注意，{{A}}的力量正在膨脹！=They were... Eaten...!? Be careful everyone, {{A}}'s power is growing even more!
{{B}}……{{A}}！美味，美味啊……\n他人之不幸，於我甜如蜜糖啊！！={{B}}... {{A}}! Delicious, delicious...\nThe misfortune of others is as sweet as honey!
下一個，就輪到你們了啊！！\n全部去死……去死吧！！=Next, it will be your turn!! \nDie everyone... Die!!
糟了，如果被那電纜襲擊，\n即使是我們，恐怕也……！=This is bad, if that chord hits us, even we...!
大家，快躲避！=Everyone, take cover!
各自散開！=Scatter!

{{A}}……沒路走了……！={{A}}... There's no where to run...!
{{C}}，{{B}}，{{A}}！！={{C}}, {{B}}, {{A}}!!
{{B}}，{{C}}，{{A}}！！={{B}}, {{C}}, {{A}}!!
不行……只能放棄對這傢伙的{{A}}了……=This is bad... we have no choice but to give up on his {{A}}...
你是說……！=You mean...!
{{A}}已經失控了……他的精神不會回歸了……\n而且……很可能還會危及生命……={{A}} is out of control... His spirit won't return... \nAt worse... it may even cost him his life...
如果不阻止他，\n現實世界中真的會有人被他殺死！！=If we stop him, people in the real world will actually be killed by him!!
必須……制止他……！=He must... Be stopped...!
毀掉……{{A}}的心……？=Destroy... {{A}}'s heart...?
真的沒有其他辦法了嗎……？=Is there really no other way...?
{{B}}，{{A}}……怎麼樣？\n露出更加絕望的表情吧……！={{B}}, {{A}}... What's wrong?\nPlease show a more desperate look...!
那種讓別人心碎的快感啊……\n好快樂，好快樂，快樂得不得了啊……=The pleasure of breaking someone's heart...\nHappy... So happy... So fun...
那個{{B}}沒出息的樣子，{{A}}！！\n真是美妙啊！！=That defeated teacher look, {{A}}!!\nIt's splendid!
啊！我們……只能動手了嗎……！=Damn! Do we... have no other way to stop this...!
毀掉……{{A}}的心嗎……\n可是那樣……現實中的{{A}}就會……=Destroy... {{A}}'s heart? \nBut then... The {{A}} in the real world...
……別在那做夢了。=...I won't let you.
哼……剛才我聽到你居然說，\n讓別人陷入不幸這件事「很快樂」。=What... Have I been hearing? \nYou think it's "fun" to let others suffer misfortune?
還說，當人無路可走的時候……\n為了活著就得吃掉別人……！？=You even say, when people are cornered...\nThey will kill as many people as they can...!?
……WIND？=...Wind?
開什麼玩笑！！=What a joke!!
被你摧毀了內心的人！\n仍然在頑強地活著！！=The people whose hearts you broke! \nThey are still living strong!!
「並不是只有你一個人在痛苦」，\n我原本不打算再說這種話了，但是……=I'm not going to lecture you, \nsaying "you're not the only one suffering", but...
生而為人，會失去，會受傷，還要面對……\n被奪走一切的殘酷，就算這樣人也不會倒下。=Even if things are unfairly taken, or lost... \nEven so, people still stand up again and again.
不要小看了……\n這些人「想要活下去」的信念和尊嚴啊！！=The dignity of those people's desires "to live"... Don't make fun of them!!
WIND……=Wind...
WIND說的沒錯=Wind is right
不會讓你死的，{{A}}！=<size\=30>Won't let you die, {{A}}!</size>
{{A}}……咕……！={{A}}... Grrr...!
謝謝你，WONDER。\n你的話……總是能給我勇氣。=Thank you, Wonder. \nYour words... Always give me courage.
這……這是……？=This... Is...?
從WIND身上感覺到了強烈的慾望……\n萌生出某種……意志的力量……！=I can feel a strong desire from Wind...\nSome power of will... has sprouted in her...!
你想要拋棄自我，連生命和慾望都放棄吧，\n這種事，我不會允許的……！=Giving up on yourself, your life, and even your desires! I won't allow it...!
你要活著去贖罪。\n你沒有資格逃避。=You have to live and atone.\nI won't accept you running away.
而且，我絕對不會讓我重要的同伴們……\n讓{{A}}……背負上奪走你性命的罪行！=And I won't let my precious friends... The {{A}}... Carry the burden of taking your life!
覺悟吧，{{A}}！=Get ready, {{A}}!
你想要拋棄自我……\n想要放棄生命的意志，會由我們「奪走」！=Your will to abandon yourself... and to give up on life, we will "take it away"!

這是=This is!
這……是什麼……\nWIND的狀態……好像變了！？=What is this... \nWind's form... Has changed!?
慾望的力量在膨脹……！WIND心靈的成長，\n難道對{{A}}和{{B}}也產生了影響……？=The power of desire is growing...! Did Wind's growth of heart affect her {{A}} and {{B}}...?
心靈的成長……？那是什麼啊！=The growth of heart...? What's that!
{{B}}是心靈的力量……也就是說，\nWIND此刻處於與{{A}}失控相反的境地……={{B}} is the power of the heart... That is to say, Wind is now the polar opposite of {{A}} going berserk.
她的慾望同樣失控了，但她並非為自己，\n而是下定決心要拯救他人的「{{A}}」！=Her desires are also going berserk, but she is not doing it for herself. She is determined to save the "{{A}}" of others!
{{A}}的……失控？=<size\=24>{{A}}... Going berserk?</size>
WIND，沒事吧！=Wind, are you alright!
身體，好燙……不過，現在的我，\n能夠站出來、幫助大家了……！=My body... So hot... But now, \nI feel like I can help everyone on the front lines.
可、那種失控的狀態……\n說明WIND她在勉強自己吧！？=But if her desires are going berserk...\nThen Wind is also pushing herself!?
嗯，應該是無法持續太久的，\n要動手的話，只能速戰速決了！=Yes, it may not last long. If we do it, we have no choice but to aim for a quick victory!
什麼生命啊……慾望啊……\n這些東西，我全部全部都要毀掉！！=What life... What desires...\nThese things, I will destroy them all!!
{{A}}……「拯救」你這種漂亮話，\n我說不出口。={{A}}... I'm not going to say some fancy words \nlike "I'll save you".
但是，我們還是不會放棄你的，\n因為{{A}}……也曾經這樣幫助過我。=But, we will not abandon you. \nJust like when teacher reached out to me.
你休想……放棄自己的慾望！\n我要堂堂正正讓你改心！=Don't you dare... Give up your desires! I'll face you head on and change your heart!

{{A}}……\n我絕不會是被吞噬的一方……={{A}}...\nI will never be on the devoured side...
被吃掉……被踐踏……我不要！！=Eaten... Trampled... I don't want it!!
{{A}}！混蛋，看我們怎麼把你打下來！={{A}}! You, we'll drag you down from the sky!
別衝動，{{A}}現在的狀態很不穩定，\n我們最好不要貿然出手。=Calm down, {{A}} is in a very unstable state right now. It would be best not to act rashly.
吾贊成WIND的判斷，\n這種情況優先考慮保全自身。=I agree with Wind's judgment, \nour priority right now is to protect ourselves.
一邊防禦一邊看準時機就行了吧……！\nWIND，你出戰真的沒關係嗎！？=It's about guarding and waiting for an opening...!\nWind, is it really okay for you to fight!?
嗯，我反而「看」得更清楚了。\n而且我也能一邊戰鬥一邊支援大家！=Yes, I can "see" more than usual. \nNow I can fight and support everyone!
他的動作……不對！大家小心！=His movements... No way! Everyone be careful!
我要毀了你們！=I will destroy you all!
我的……都是我的啊……=All mine... It's all mine...
{{A}}……\n我們該不會跟那些陰影一個下場吧……={{A}}... \nWe won't end up like those Shadows, right...
持久戰對吾等不利，\n考慮集中火力，一口氣解決吧。=We have no chance of winning if this becomes a prolonged battle. We have no choice but to launch a concentrated attack.
等等，也許也有別的選擇……！\n大家看看那邊！=Wait, there may be another way...! \nEveryone, look over that!
啊，透過擊中那東西來攻擊{{A}}吧，\n這個方法可以！=I see, we can use that giant thing to attack {{A}}!\nGood idea!
確實也不失為一種應敵策略，\n選擇就交給隊長判斷了！=It's certainly not a bad strategy,\nthe decision is up to the leader!
{{B}}……{{A}}……被吃掉嗎……\n我總是……勝利者……={{B}}... {{A}}... Getting eaten...\nI'm always... The winner...
與其被吃掉……我寧願放棄所有……！！=As long as I can eat... \nI don't need anything else...!!
{{A}}已是強弩之末，但他失控的程度已經超出他的極限……！={{A}} has reached his limit, \nbut even he can't stop this berserk...!
嗯，吾估計他想要與吾等同歸於盡。\nWIND，有什麼對策嗎？=Yes, I think he wants us to perish together.\nWind, what's the plan?
在{{A}}的力量膨脹到無法抵抗之前，打倒他。\n大家，速戰速決！=We have no choice but to defeat {{A}} before his powers grow out of control. Everyone, blitzkrieg!
{{B}}，全都去死吧，{{A}}！\n我要吃……不夠不夠！還不夠！={{B}}, let's go together, {{A}}! \nI have to eat... Not enough! Not enough!
他開始發瘋了嗎……！！\n我們得再快點！=Is he going crazy...!!\nWe have to hurry!
還差一點……我的力量就充滿了……\n{{C}}……{{B}}……{{A}}！=Almost... My power is almost full...\n{{C}}... {{B}}... {{A}}!
時間不多了！但我們……\n會堅持到最後一刻的，對吧，WONDER！=There's no time left! But we...\nWon't give up until the end, right? Wonder!

要我活下去……？事到如今……\n被我吞噬掉的人卻要我活著嗎……？=Want me to live...? After all that...\nThe people I've devoured want me to live...?
那種滋味……不……我做不到……=How... Impossible... I can't...
不要隨便就對自己下定論。=Don't assume it's impossible.
你的所作所為……我是不會原諒的，\n於情於理我都沒有想過救你……=Of course I have no intention of forgiving what you did, and I never thought of saving you...
但是我知道，人是可以改變的。=But I know that people can change.
雖然不甘心，但確實是因為你，\n還有{{A}}……我才能做出改變。=I'm not happy about it, but thanks to your misdeeds and {{A}}... I've changed.
所以，我們不會放任你自生自滅。\n為了贖罪……你也必須要活下去。=So, we reach out to you. In order to atone for your sins... You must continue to live.
{{A}}……這麼嚴格嗎……\n真是可怕的……慾望……={{A}}... There's no trace of kindness...What a horrifying... desire...
因為我恨你。=Because I hate you.
{{A}}，這麼直接！={{A}}, that's straightforward!
但……我要你活著，要你不拋棄自我，\n這是我忠於慾望的答案。=But... I want you to live, I don't want you to abandon yourself, that's the answer true to my desires.
忠於慾望……嗎……{{A}}……=True to your desires... I see... {{A}}...
我……是從哪一步……走錯的……呢……=Where... Did I... Go wrong...
噢，恢復成原樣了……=Oh, are they back to normal...
唔，那副樣子的話，\n現實中的{{A}}應該不會有生命危險了。=Hm, from the look of things, \nthe real {{A}} shouldn't be in danger.
太好了……就算我們是怪盜，\n也絕對不想傷害到人的生命啊……=That's great... Even if we are Phantom Thieves, \nwe definitely don't want to take someone's life...
你們怎麼回事……\n嘴上說不會原諒我，現在卻又救我……=What's this... You say you can't forgive me, \nbut you still want to save me...
像是一出幼稚噁心的青春劇……=Like a childish and disgusting teen drama...
你不也是嘴上這麼說，其實這個題材，\n你很喜歡吧？就像你的節目策劃案一樣……=You say that but you really like that genre, don't you? It's just like your program proposals...
{{A}}！那個社團活動對抗戰的節目！\n我可喜歡看了！={{A}}! That clubs versus show! I loved watching it!
部長跟部員之間的矛盾、還有感動……\n每週都讓人熱血沸騰啊！=The conflicts between the president and their members, as well as the emotions... Every week is exciting!
……那個案子早就被搶走了，\n從頭到尾我根本就沒參與過。=...That project was stolen from me, \nI didn't write anything.
但是……嗯。\n……那個……是我想做的……=But... Yes.\n...I wanted... To make that...
小時候我身體不好……去不了學校……\n所以對那種青春……一直很嚮往……=I used to be sick... And couldn't go to school... \nSo I always longed for... That kind of youth...
我想在電視上……給像我一樣……\n躺在病床上的孩子們……帶去一點青春……=I wanted to bring a little bit of youth... To the children who were sick... Just like me through television...
很棒的……節目吧……\n真想自己……製作啊……=It's a great... Show...\nI wish... I could've produced it myself...
那個東西……\n是節目獲得社長獎的獎盃呢。=That is... \nThe president's award trophy for that show.
雖然被人奪走了……\n但也是我想出來的節目獲獎了……=He took it away... \nBut the show I came up with won an award...
……我們拿走了哦=...We're taking this
我們可以奪走嗎？=Can we take it?
嗯，請吧……=Yes, please...
想來，\n我就是因為這件事變得扭曲了吧……=Thinking about it,\nI guess that's why I became distorted.
拋棄了一切……\n我一直都恨不得一死了之。=I've always wanted to... \nThrow everything away and die.
可是……當時多虧了「那個人」……\n我才想要……活下去……=But... Thanks to "that person"...\nI wanted... To live...
好像現在的我，從你們那……\n獲得了活下去的慾望一樣……啊……=It's just like you...\nGave me the desire to live now...
啊，消失了……！=Ah, disappeared...!
{{B}}，還是沒能打聽到「那個人」是誰啊……\n不過，至少{{A}}不會死了吧？={{B}}, I guess we didn't get to hear about "that person"... But at least {{A}} won't die, right?
嗯，應該趕上了，不過吾認為，\n還是有必要確認一下現實中{{A}}的情況……=Ah, we made it on time. But I think it is still necessary to confirm {{A}}'s situation in reality...
那傢伙應該是取得了{{A}}後才消失的。\n這也是WONDER和WIND的功勞。=He must have regained his {{A}} and vanished. Thanks to Wonder and Wind.
但願如此……嗚！=I hope so... Aagh!
WIND！你沒事吧？=Wind! Are you alright?
你沒事吧！？=Are you alright!?
不要勉強自己=Don't push yourself
謝謝，我沒事，只是有點虛弱，\n可能是在剛才的戰鬥中消耗太大了。=Thank you, I'm fine. I'm just a bit tired. \nMaybe I over exerted myself from the battle earlier.
「{{A}}」……這種力量，\n看來果然不是輕易能發揮出來的。="{{A}}"... It seems like that's not a power that can be used all the time.
唔，我還挺得住。\n我們還要去拿{{A}}的{{B}}。=Yes, we have to make one more push. \nWe have to get {{A}}'s {{B}}.
嗯，可是……奪走{{B}}的話，\n{{A}}就會崩塌吧。=Yes, but... If we steal the {{B}}, \nthe {{A}} will collapse.
那就只能先拿了{{B}}，\n然後一口氣跑到{{A}}那邊？=Once we steal {{B}},\nwe go straight to {{A}}'s Treasure?
感覺距離好遠啊，\n不過CATTLE開快點的話說不定……趕得上？=It feels like it's quite a distance away, \nif Ruferu flies... Maybe it'll work out?
{{A}}……吾可以試試看，\n不過吾現在也相當疲憊了啊……={{A}}... I can try it, \nbut I'm also pretty exhausted now...
{{A}}，我其實也是……\n唔……有沒有什麼好辦法……=Right, me too... \nHmm... Is there a good way to do this?
同時奪取兩個{{A}}=<size\=26>Take both {{A}}s at once</size>
……{{A}}？什麼意思？=...{{A}}? What does that mean?
你看來有想法了吧，說來聽聽？=You seem to have an idea, let me know.

能聽見嗎？這邊已經抵達指定位置。=I can hear you. We're in position.
嗯，再確認一下作戰計畫。\n奪走{{B}}之時，{{A}}就會開始崩塌。=Well then, let's confirm the plan. The moment we steal the {{B}}, the {{A}} will collapse.
所以此次吾等分成兩組、務必同時奪取{{B}}，\n然後以最快速度離開{{A}}，沒問題吧？=Therefore, the two teams need to steal the {{B}} at exactly the same time and escape as quickly as possible, understand?

請允許我冒昧地代表{{A}}，為您鼓掌。=Allow me to applaud on behalf of the {{A}}.
{{A}}……{{B}}……{{C}}……{{D}}……={{A}}... {{B}}... {{C}}... {{D}}...
這是你所凌駕之人表現出的慾望。\n在社會之中被視為最應該規避的……=<size\=30>The desires of those you have surpassed are considered something to be avoided in this world.</size>
但只要為人，\n就無法避免最根源處的慾望……即{{A}}。=As long as one is human, one cannot escape from their root desires... The {{A}}s.

哦？是這樣嗎？{{B}}，\n被稱作{{A}}的醜陋慾望，的確是存在的。=Oh? Is that so? {{B}},\nthe hideous desire called {{A}} does exists.
「{{A}}」……相比這個慾望枯竭的世界，\n那是個完全相反的存在，所以……你怎麼想？="{{A}}"... That is the polar opposite of this desire-depleted world. So... What do you think?
你認為如今的這個世界中……\n有可能存在「{{A}}」嗎？=Do you think there could be...\nA "{{A}}" in this world today?
我覺得有=I think yes
我覺得沒有=I think no

救護車=Ambulance!
不許動！=Freeze!

牆上貼著的，就是這一層的地圖吧。=The map of this floor is here.
看上去是的。=Looks like it.
唔……奇怪。=Hmm... Strange.
怎麼了，CATTLE，你有什麼預感嗎？=What's the matter, Cattle?
沒……沒什麼。=It's... Nothing...
可能是吾多想了吧。=Maybe I'm overthinking it.
算了，吾還是解釋一下吧。=Never mind, I'd better explain.
吾一進來時，感知到這個區域非常的巨大。=<size\=29>When we entered, I felt that this area was gigantic.</size>
但是看地圖卻感覺並不是這樣。=But looking at the map, that doesn't seem like the case.
我剛才又重新感知了一下，吾的感覺沒有錯。=I just sensed it again, and my feeling is not wrong.
這個區域的結構，\n可能比地圖上繪製的「<color\=#ff0000>更加複雜</color>」。=The structure of this area, it is very likely more "<color\=#ff0000>more complicated</color>" than the drawn map.
總之各位小心一點！=All in all, be careful!

地圖上顯示，這個地方有一個安全屋。=The map shows that there's a safe room here.
但是這個地方是完全封死的。=But this is completely sealed off.
打不開嘛……=Won't open...
那我們先去別的地方探索吧。=Let's explore somewhere else first.

這個門，打不開嗎？=Can't open this door?
地圖上顯示，這裡是可以通過的{{A}}。=The map shows that there's a passage here.
也許需要從另一側把門打開。=Maybe we have to open it from the other side.
不是的，SOY，CLOSER。=No, SOY, CLOSER.
吾感知到這個門後面，\n沒有任何怪物和{{A}}的氣息。=I sense there is no monsters or treasures behind this door.
那是剛才拿到的地圖錯了嗎？=Is the map we just got wrong?
以前從來沒有拿到過錯誤的地圖吧。=We've never gotten a wrong map before.
吾一直有一個疑惑。=I have always had a doubt.
這些房間在空間上真的在「<color\=#ff0000>同一層</color>」嗎？=Are these rooms really "<color\=#ff0000>on the same floor</color>"?
仔細觀察，小心探索吧，WONDER。=Watch closely. Explore carefully, Wonder.

前面看上去好像完全沒有路了，\n唯一的路也被「<color\=#ff0000>電子阻擋門</color>」擋住了。=Looks like there's no where to go, and the only path is blocked by an "<color\=#ff0000>electronic gate</color>".
稍等一下，CLOSER。=Wait a minute, Closer.
這個門後面有一個識別開關，\n吾等可以利用機器人關閉它。=There is an identification switch behind this gate, \nwe can switch it off with a robot.
但是哪裡能找到機器人呢？=But where can we find a robot?
先用機器人的「<color\=#ff0000>操控台</color>」試一試吧，\n也許吾等就能找到機器人的位置了。=First use the robot's "<color\=#ff0000>Console</color>",\nmaybe we'll be able to find the robot's location.
嗯，WONDER，交給你了。=Well, Wonder, we will leave it to you.

這個房間我總感覺我們來過，\n一個一模一樣的房間。=I feel like we've been to this identical room before.
我也有同樣的預感。=I feel the same.
感覺不太對……=Something feels off...
這個房間的謎題，怎麼感覺發生「<color\=#ff0000>變化</color>」了？=The puzzle of this room. \nWhy does it feel it "<color\=#ff0000>changed</color>"?
剛才螢幕的分佈，好像不是這樣的。=The distribution of the screen just now doesn't seem to be this.
啊……好像確實不一樣了。=Ah... It seems to be different.
是房間自己復原了？還是其他的可能性。=Is it possible that the room fixed itself? Or somthing else.
不可能的。=Impossible
以前沒有類似的情況。=Never seen this before
這可能就是我剛才說的情況。=This may be what I just said.
仔細探查，小心前進吧。=Explore carefully. Proceed with caution.

正準備給你們發訊息\n我到了教室後才聽說的=I was just about to message you guys, only heard about it after I got to the classroom.
班裡所有人都在聊這件事=Everyone in class is talking about it.
我們班也是=Same in our class.

知道了=Got it
中午再說=We'll talk at noon
好，中午見=Okay, I'll see you at noon.
Mission Start
網上說，\n刺殺{{B}}的似乎也是{{A}}。=Online rumors say the one who stabbed {{B}} might also be a {{A}}.
聽說兇手在車站附近到處晃，\n邊自言自語邊亂揮剪刀，還突然怪叫……=Apparently the culprit was wandering near the station, mumbling to himself, swinging scissors around, and suddenly screaming...
好像被投稿過好幾次了。\n大家都叫他「{{A}}剪刀男」。=Seems like he was posted about several times. Everyone's calling him the "Shibuya Scissor Man".
網上現在有兩種意見：\n「和{{B}}無關的{{A}}無差別殺人」……=Right now there are two opinions online:\n"A random murder by a {{A}}, unrelated to {{B}}"...
和「對{{A}}懷恨在心的人行兇」。\n大家在評論區裡討論得熱火朝天呢。=And "someone who held a grudge against {{A}} committed the crime". The forum seems to be full of speculation.
因為有人死了，\n所以就上了熱門嗎……=Does the death of a person make the internet go wild...
雖說這是人性，但對讓{{A}}的吾等而言，\n心情還是很複雜阿……=Although that may be human nature, I have mixed feelings about this as we were the ones who changed Akashi's heart...
……{{A}}是在警察局前被刺的吧。=...{{A}} was stabbed in front of the police station, right?
難不成他……\n那時是想去自首嗎？=Could it be... \nhe was planning to turn himself in?
我也這麼覺得=I think so too

Choice 1
是吧……畢竟他在{{A}}的影片裡，\n也說什麼要贖罪之類的呢。=Right... After all, he said something about atonement in that {{A}} video.
Choice 2
嗯，也許只是湊巧路過那裡。\n只是……=Hmm, maybe he just happened to be passing by, it's just that...
畢竟他在{{A}}的影片裡，\n也說過什麼要贖罪之類的呢。=After all, he said something about atonement in that {{A}} video.
我覺得，\n可能他是真要去自首……=I think, he was trying to turn himself in...

但是竟然……\n就這麼死掉了……=And yet...\nHe died...
大家覺不覺得這件事未免也太巧了？=Hey, do you think the timing of this incident is too convenient?
在警察局附近「剛好」有殺人犯，\n{{A}}「剛好」經過那裡所以被殺。=There just "happened to" be a random murderer near the police station, and {{A}} just "happened to" walk by and got stabbed.
這真的只是偶然嗎？=Is it really just a coincidence?
如果正是因為他要去自首，\n所以才慘遭「滅口」呢……？=Isn't it possible that he was "silenced" because he was trying to turn himself in...?
被滅口……！=Silenced...!
被「那個人」？=By "that person"?
被「幕後黑手」？=By the "mastermind"?
被誰？=By who?

Choice 1
沒錯。\n{{A}}和{{B}}都提到過的……「那個人」。=That's right. The one both {{A}} and {{B}} mentioned... "That person".
扭曲了他們的慾望，\n讓他們創造出{{A}}的，「幕後黑手」。=The one who distorted their desires, and led them to create their {{A}}, the "mastermind".
Choice 2
沒錯。就是操縱{{A}}他們的慾望，\n讓他們創造出{{B}}的「幕後黑手」。=That's right, the one who manipulated their desires, and led them to create their {{B}}, the "mastermind".
也是改心後的{{A}}和{{B}}所說的……\n「那個人」。=The one both {{A}} and {{B}} mentioned after their change of heart... "That person".
Choice 3
你不記得了嗎？\n{{A}}和{{B}}提到過的「那個人」。=Don't you remember? "That person" mentioned by both {{A}} and {{B}}.
扭曲了{{A}}們的慾望，\n製造出{{B}}的「幕後黑手」啊。=The "mastermind" who distorted {{A}}'s desires and created their {{B}}.

{{C}}受他指使潛入學校，\n故意把{{B}}塑造成{{A}}。={{C}} was ordered by the mastermind to infiltrate the school and purposely frame {{B}} as a {{A}}.
沒錯，\n是為了查我們{{A}}的身份吧。=Right, that was to figure out our {{A}}' identities, wasn't it?
但反而{{A}}卻被我們……\n被{{C}}{{B}}了。=But instead, {{A}} has a change of heart by us, the {{C}}.
但反而{{A}}卻被我們……\n被{{B}}改心了。=But instead, {{A}} has a change of heart by us, the {{B}}.
考慮到{{A}}在失控前的言行，\n可能他從那時起就已經被拋棄了……=Considering {{A}}'s words and actions just before he went berserk, he may have been discarded at that point...
不管怎樣，他那段自白影片，\n一定也引起了幕後黑手的注意。=Either way, his confession video must have drawn the mastermind's attention.
然後那個人發現{{A}}已經被改心，\n為了不暴露身份就下手滅口……吧。=Then that person realized {{A}} has a change of heart, and silenced him to avoid being exposed... right.
這麼說，殺害{{B}}的那個{{A}}，\n也是幕後黑手的手下嗎……？=So you're saying the {{A}} who killed {{B}} was also working under the mastermind...?
可是，就算是買兇殺人，\n也不可能直接在警察局門口動手吧！=But no one's stupid enough to kill someone right in front of a police station, even under orders!
不過，\n也許那個人真的具備如此強大的影響力呢。=But maybe that person is someone with that much influence.
啊，要是被他知道了{{A}}的身份，\n我們也會被……？=Ah, if he finds out who we {{A}} really are, we'll also be...? 
雖然還不知道幕後黑手的真實身份，\n毫無疑問，他是個可怕的敵人。=The identity of the mastermind is still unknown, but there's no doubt that he's a fearsome enemy.
今後吾等必須更加謹慎行事。=We will have to proceed more carefully from now on.
不過……有這麼危險的人到處幹壞事，\n反而更需要我們{{A}}出手吧。=But... if there is someone like that running rampant, isn't it time for us, the {{A}}, to step in?
不如我們繼續攻略其他{{A}}，\n把他逼出來！=Why don't we keep taking down more {{A}}s and force him out!
說得也是。\n怪盜被壞人嚇倒，這不是搞反了嘛！=True! If the Phantom Thieves get scared off by bad people, that'd be totally backwards!
當然，吾也並不打算停止攻略{{A}}。\n但大家一定要加倍小心，沒問題吧？=Of course, I have no intention of stopping {{A}} infiltration, but we need to act more carefully than ever, understood?
現在已經拿到了四個{{B}}……\n還是想儘快找到下一座{{A}}……=We've already secured four {{A}}s...\nI want to find the next {{A}} soon...
嗯？\n怎麼了，{{A}}。=Hm? \nWhat's up, {{A}}.
那個……最近幾天，\n我可能都沒辦法在放學後參加行動了。=Well... I might not be able to join after school for a while.
{{A}}不在怎麼行！=<size\=28>Can't do this without {{A}}!</size>

真的很抱歉。\n可是……=I'm really sorry.\nBut...
……{{A}}的「學園祭」，\n不是馬上就要到了嗎？=...{{A}}'s "school festival" is coming up soon, right?

今年好像會特別忙。\n所以放學後我應該騰不出時間來……=This year is going to be pretty busy. So I don't think I'll have time after school...
學園祭啊……好像的確到時候了。\n但{{A}}也會很忙嗎？=The school festival... Guess it is that time. But even the {{A}} gets busy?
當然。無論是準備期還是活動當天，\n雜事都比平時多了不少。=Of course it's going to be busy. There will be more problems than usual during the preparation period and on the day itself.
而且……\n這次還不止是這個原因呢……=And... \nthat's not the only reason...

學園祭執行委員=School Festival Committee Member
啊，找到了……！\n{{A}}，救命啊！=Ah, there you are...! \nPlease help us, {{A}}!
……怎麼了？=...What's wrong?
學園祭的交流活動……\n{{A}}和{{B}}要合演舞臺劇！？=During the school festival... {{A}} and {{B}} will be doing a joint play!?
可是，\n我們學校根本沒有戲劇部啊！=But there's no drama club at our school!
就是說啊！但這是之前……\n{{B}}和{{A}}擅自定的！=That's true! But this was something... {{B}} and {{A}} decided on their own!
說什麼，{{A}}有學生是專業的舞臺演員，\n還有職業漫畫家……=Apparently, there's a professional stage actor and professional manga artist from {{A}}...
{{A}}他們好像是想靠那兩個學生，\n給學園祭拉觀眾呢！=It seems that the teachers were trying to attract visitors to the school festival by inviting the two of them!
所以就說要合演舞臺劇對吧。\n該說他們欠考慮呢，還是目光短淺呢……=So that's why they suggested a joint stage play. Can't tell if they were being thoughtless or just short-sighted...
然後呢？現在兩位{{A}}都不在了，\n才發現有這件事？=Now that both Yamanashi-sensei and Akashi-sensei are gone, this has come to light?
對啊！而且{{A}}的戲劇部好像還很上心，\n我們怎麼辦才好啊……！=That's right! And apparently {{A}}'s drama club is really into it, what should we do...! 

然後……{{A}}，\n你不會說了「我來想想辦法」之類的話吧？=So... Don't tell me {{A}} said something like "I'll handle it"?
說了……=Said it...
因為他們看上去很慘啊。\n本來這個時候最忙的就是執行委員。=They just looked so miserable. And this is supposed to be the busiest time for committee members.
而且我一聽說是那兩個人留下的爛攤子，\n就更不能置之不理了。=And when I heard it was a mess left behind by those two, I couldn't just leave it alone.
哎～=Ahh～
{{A}}太好心了={{A}} is too kind
你又在勉強自己了=<size\=25>You're pushing yourself again</size>

Choice 1
對啊……我們只是擔心，\n{{A}}又要操心這操心那了……=Yeah… We're just worried {{A}} is gonna take everything on herself again...
這倒是不會。\n畢竟{{A}}所謂的工作改革已經廢除了……=That's fine. {{A}}'s so-called work reform was abolished the other day...
Choice 2
謝謝，我沒事的。\n畢竟{{A}}所謂的工作改革已經廢除了……=Thanks you, I'm fine. {{A}}'s so-called work reform was abolished the other day...

{{A}}也恢復了工作，\n她會牽頭讓其他{{B}}幫我的。=The teachers, including the returned {{A}}, are all helping me.
要是{{A}}能忙得過來倒也沒什麼。\n那個{{B}}還真是丟下個爛攤子啊……=If {{A}} can handle it, then that's fine. That {{B}} really left a mess...
{{A}}是已經向警察自首，\n現在被停職處分了吧？={{A}} turned himself in to the police and is now on leave, right?
是的，到現在也沒確定返校日期。\n感覺他更有可能會被直接辭退吧。=Yes, and there's still no set date for his return. There's a good chance he'll just be dismissed entirely.
我暫且從{{A}}的電腦裡，\n確認了這次活動的策劃案……=I checked the project proposal on {{A}}'s computer...
原計劃是以{{A}}為主力，\n讓各個委員會的學生都參與演出。=Originally, the {{A}}s were the lead, with students from all committees also participating.
打算趕鴨子上架演戲啊……\n這也太隨便了……=They seriously planned to throw together a play with this ragtag group... This goes beyond bad planning...
而且說什麼以{{B}}為主力，\n顯然是打算都扔給{{A}}啊……=And what's with the {{B}}s as the lead, it's obvious they were trying to dump it all on {{A}}...
那要按照{{A}}的安排，\n讓{{B}}去演戲嗎？=So should we follow {{A}}'s plan and let the {{B}}s act?
那是真不行啦。\n而且其他委員在活動期間也都很忙的。=That's obviously not possible. All the other members are very busy during the school festival.
那怎麼辦啊？=Then what should we do?
道個歉拒絕？=Apologize and decline?
招募其他有志之士？=<size\=29>Recruit willing volunteers?</size>
不會讓我們上吧……？=<size\=27>Surely you won't have us do it...?</size>

Choice 1
說實話，\n這才是正確的選擇……=To be honest,\nthis is the right choice...
但我想先試著招募一下有志之士呢。=But I'd like to try recruiting some willing volunteers first.
Choice 2
{{A}}，不愧是隊長。\n其實我也是這麼想的。={{A}}, as expected from leader. In fact, I was thinking of doing the same thing.
儘管我也考慮過跟{{A}}道歉，\n婉拒這次交流活動，但……=I thought about apologizing to {{A}} and refusing the offer...
Choice 3
{{A}}，其實我也想過這樣，\n不過我打算先招募一下有志之士。={{A}}, I thought about that too, but I'd like to try recruiting some willing volunteers first.

雖說這是{{A}}擅自定的，\n可對{{B}}來說也是學校間的約定啊。=Even if {{A}} went ahead with it on his own, for {{B}}, it's still a promise between schools.
在對方戲劇部看來，\n他們會覺得{{A}}的學生說話不算話。=From their drama club's perspective, it will seem like our students broke their promise.
的確……會被抱怨說：\n「明明是{{A}}來求我們的，搞什麼啊！」=Definitely... They'll complain: "You were the one who came begging us, what the heck!"
對。所以我覺得，\n比起直接放棄，不如先努力一下試試看。=Right. Rather than giving up, I thought I'd try my best.
你已經有了很不錯的慾望，{{A}}。\n吾相信你的想法會感染學生們的。=You have a very good desire, {{A}}. I'm sure your feelings will spread to the students.
謝謝。不過……\n能不能招到人，我心裡也沒底呢……=Thank you. But... I don't know if I'll be able to recruit anyone...
我會問問班裡的同學！\n對了，是不是做個海報效果更好？=I'll ask my class! Ah, maybe I should make a poster or something?
我也來幫忙，如果有需要的地方就說。\n雖然我對演戲完全是門外漢……=I'll help out too. Just let me know if there's anything I can do. I don't know much about acting though...
我也會幫忙的=I'll help too
我會為你加油的=I'll be cheering for you

Choice 1
謝謝大家。=Thank you, everyone.
Choice 2
r:"^不是啦，別光顧著加油，\n(.*)也來幫忙啊……$"="No, don't just cheer, $1 should help too..."
{{A}}，謝謝。這畢竟是我答應的事，\n只是加油我也會很開心的。={{A}}, thank you. This is something I took on, so I'm happy just to have that sentiment.

好了，差不多下午的課也要開始了。\n我們回教室吧？=Right, afternoon classes are about to start. \nShall we head back to the classroom?

r:"^好了，(.*)！\n我們出發吧～！$"="Okay, $1!\nLet's go～!"
去哪兒？=Where to?

Choice 2
都是傳單哦！\n幫{{A}}招募演舞臺劇演員的！=It's a flyer! To help {{A}} recruit actors for the stage play!

哦……！？\n你都已經做好了嗎！=Oh...!?\nYou've already made it!
那是。同伴碰到困難，哪能放著不管阿。\n俗話說「好事宜遲」嘛！=I can't just leave my friends in trouble. As the saying goes, "More haste, less speed"!
……是「好事不宜遲」啦。=...If you're going to say that, then it should be "All haste, no delay".
哦，是嗎？哎呀別在意那些細節！\n我們開始發傳單吧～Let's go！=Oh, was it? Meh, forget the details! \nAnyway, time to pass these out～ Let's go!

我們是學園祭戲劇組～\n正在招募有志人士～！=The school festival drama team is recruiting～!
無論是否對表演感興趣，\n希望大家都能踴躍參加～！=Whether you're interested in theater or not, please join us～!
和{{A}}一起發了傳單……=Handed out flyers with {{A}}...

完全招不到人啊……=Can't recruit anyone at all...
可不是嘛。就算趁放學後發傳單，\n也沒人停下來聽我們說話……=That's right. We handed out flyers after school, but no one listened...
啊，我也是。\n在班裡拉了一圈人，全滅……=Ah, me too. I tried asking the guys in my class, but it was a complete failure...
有的說社團活動太忙了，\n也有很多根本就沒想去學園祭。=Most people are either too busy with their club stuff or just skipping the festival altogether.
{{A}}，還有人不參加嗎！？={{A}}, there are people not going!?
好不容易不上課，要回家睡覺。\n好幾個人都這麼說呢。=I heard some guys say that if there's no class, they'll just sleep at home.
怎麼會……明明我都已經開始期待，\n學園祭上能吃什麼好的了！=I can't believe it... I'm already looking forward to what I'm going to eat!
……也就是說，\n有那麼多學生失去了慾望啊。=...This just goes to show that many students have lost their desires.
的確……\n感覺比起去年，學園祭的熱度降低了不少。=That's true... Compared to last year, the enthusiasm around the school festival feels way lower.
所以才招不到演出的人嗎……=So that's why we can't even recruit anyone...
當然，\n還有很多是不好意思上臺啦～=Of course. There are a lot of people who are shy to go on stage～
他們說如果「{{A}}」要來的話，\n就想去看看。但絕對不想自己上臺演。=They say if "{{A}}" is coming, they'd love to go watch. But absolutely no way they'd perform themselves. 
是哪個明星嗎？=Which celebrity is it?

Choice 1
沒錯，是在{{A}}上學的專業演員啦。\n聽說是高三學生呢。=Yes, the professional actor who goes to {{A}}... I heard he's a third-year student.
Choice 2
{{B}}，你忘了？本來這次，\n就是想靠{{A}}的專業演員拉客呢。={{B}}, did you forget? This was about attracting people by relying on that professional actor from {{A}}.
那個演員就是{{A}}。\n好像是高三學生。=That actor is {{A}}. He's a third-year student.

{{A}}……\n我沒聽說過啊。={{A}}...\nI've never heard of them.
他似乎沒怎麼上過電視，\n是以演舞臺劇為主的。=It seems he doesn't appear on TV much. he mainly appears in stage play.
我之前也不了解，查了一下才知道，\n他好像在初高中生之間很受歡迎呢。=I didn't know much about him, but after searching, he seems quite popular, especially with high school students.
可不是嗎～\n我們班也有不少他的粉絲。=That's right～\nThere are quite a few fans in our class too.
說他的彩排影片和幕後花絮都超帥，\n安利我看了好多呢。=They showed me tons of his rehearsal clips and behind-the-scenes footage, all super cool!
什麼啊，那讓他的那些粉絲們，\n來演這個舞臺劇不就好了嘛。=What the heck, then why don't those fans just go perform in the play themselves?
不是哦，她們說去看自己的推當然很好，\n但要跟推站在同一個舞臺上就不行。=That's a different story. They say it's fine to watch from the sidelines, but actually standing on the same stage just feels off.
啊？要是讓我跟{{A}}在同一個廚房做拉麵，\n那可是再開心不過了！=Huh? If it were me, being able to make ramen in the same kitchen as {{A}} would be the best thing ever!
拉麵跟演戲是不一樣的吧……\n原來對{{A}}來說，{{B}}是「推」啊……=Ramen and acting are two different things... Also, {{B}} is {{A}}'s "favorite"...
{{B}}……\n跟{{A}}碰面的日子快到了，真傷腦筋啊。={{B}}... The day we meet with {{A}} is coming up soon, this is such a headache.
如果再招不到人的話……\n{{A}}，能麻煩你來演嗎？=If we really can't recruit anyone... \n{{A}}, could I ask you to act?
{{A}}？\n真的要讓我演嗎！？=Eh?\nYou seriously want me to act!?
很合適啊=Perfect fit
我一定會去捧場的=<size\=30>I'll come to support you</size>
有點擔心……=A bit worried...

Choice 1
嗯，論演技的話{{A}}肯定沒問題，\n畢竟連{{B}}也能騙過。=Yes, {{A}}'s acting skills are second to none.\nShe even managed to fool {{B}}.
{{A}}～可是，\n在舞臺上演戲是另一回事吧！？={{A}}～ \nBut being on stage is a whole other story!?
Choice 2
等等等等，\n我們能不能別站著說話不腰疼？=No no no, can we not just stand here acting like it's so easy?
Choice 3
對吧對吧！？\n我肯定不行的啦，{{A}}！=R-Right!?\nI can't do it, {{A}}!
不，我覺得{{A}}你很合適啊。\n騙{{B}}那時候，你的演技可精湛了。=No, I think it fits {{A}}. Your acting skills when fooling {{B}} were also impressive.
不，可是，\n我當時好多話都是真心話來著……=No, but at that time my true feelings were mixed in...

{{A}}……拜託你了！={{A}}... Please!
{{B}}，被{{A}}這麼一求，\n讓我怎麼忍心拒絕……！={{B}}, when you ask me like that, {{A}}, how can I possibly say no...!
{{A}}，那行吧……\n如果完全招不到人的話……我就上？={{A}}, fine then... \nIf we can't recruit anyone... I'll do it?
謝謝你，{{A}}！=Thank you, {{A}}!
{{A}}，一定要招到人啊……！={{A}}, I hope someone will volunteer...!

追星族女孩=Celebrity Fangirl
呐，剛才朋友發訊息說，\n{{A}}現在就在我們學校哦！=Hey, my friend just messaged me,\n{{A}} is in our school right now!
{{A}}女粉絲={{A}} Fangirl
真假！？什麼情況！？他在哪兒！？=For real!? What's going on!? Where is he!?
真假！？什麼情況！？他在哪裡！？=For real!? What's going on!? Where is he!?
我也不知道啦！你看，還有照片！\n他在{{A}}的走廊上呢！=I don't know either! Look, there's even a photo! He's in the hallway of {{A}}!
{{A}}，真的！\n我們走！快去找找他！={{A}}, really!\nLet's go! We have to hurry!
sr:"^(.*)，我們走吧！\n聽說集合地點是<color\=#ff0000>接待室</color>。$"="$1, let's go! I heard the meeting place is the <color\=#ff0000>reception room</color>."
你忘啦？\n就是跟{{A}}戲劇部的第一次碰頭啦。=Did you forget? \nIt's our first meeting with {{A}}'s drama club.
我們雖然只是幫忙的，\n但{{A}}說讓我們也一起。走吧？=We're just helping out, but {{A}} asked us to listen to the discussion together. Let's go!

r:"^啊，是(.*)，還有(.*)。\n謝謝你們能來。$"="Ah, it's $1, and $2.\nThank you for coming."
招人的事情……\n最後怎麼樣了？=So how did it go... \nwith the recruitment thing?
很遺憾，目前依然是0人。\n看來{{A}}和我參演，已經板上釘釘了……=Unfortunately, still zero people.\nLooks like {{A}} and I will be performing...
真的嗎……也就是說，\n{{B}}這邊只有{{C}}跟{{A}}出場嗎？=For real... So that means, the only people doing the play on {{B}}'s side are {{C}} and {{A}}.
是啊。結果就我們倆參加，\n還是會讓{{A}}對我們印象很差吧。=Yes. With just the two of us participating, I'm afraid we'll leave a terrible impression on {{A}}.
如今只能告訴他們這邊的真實情況，\n好好道歉了。=I'll explain the situation properly and apologize.
如果對方不想合作，這件事就到此為止。\n如果還願意繼續合演的話……=If they refuse, then the matter is over. \nIf they still want to do it...
那我們就加油吧，{{A}}。=Let's do our best, {{A}}.

請進。=Please come in.
請坐吧？=Please take a seat.

{{A}}就是它的作者啦！={{A}} is the author!

{{C}}……雖然我知道{{A}}是高中生，\n但沒想到就是{{B}}的學生呀～={{C}}... I knew {{A}} was a high school student, but I didn't expect her to be a student at {{B}}～
事到如今怎麼還一驚一乍……\n不是你們非要{{A}}和{{B}}來參加嗎？=Why are you still so surprised... Weren't you the ones who insisted on having {{A}} and {{B}} to join?
不就是為了把高中生演員，\n和高中生漫畫家都拉來貴校學園祭嗎？=You wanted to invite the high school actor and manga artist to your school festival, right?
關於這件事，其實……=About this, actually...

啥！？你們學校沒有戲劇部！？\n而且現在演員也只有兩個！？=What!? Your school doesn't even have a drama club!? And now there are only two actors!?
真的很抱歉！=I am truly sorry!
是那個已經停職的{{B}}擅自決定的！\n{{A}}也是最近才知道……=The teachers on break decided this themselves. {{A}} only just found out...
那又關我們什麼事！\n搞什麼啊，當我們傻的嗎！=And what does that have to do with us! What, do you think we're stupid!
實在是非常抱歉……！=I am very sorry...!
我們把準備東京預賽的時間都空出來了，\n專門留給你們了啊！=We've cleared our entire schedule for the Tokyo competition, just for you!
要不是你們{{A}}一直死纏爛打，\n我們才不會答應呢！=We've refused many times, \nbut your teachers insisted!
真的是十分抱歉！=I am truly sorry!
不也挺好嘛，部長。\n意思是這件事到此為止了唄？=That's fine, president. \nSo this is the end of the matter?
啊？=Huh?
她們不想搞演出。\n我們也不想站在{{A}}的舞臺上。=They don't really want to perform, and we don't want to stand on {{A}}'s stage.
雙方利害一致，合作到此結束。\n對吧？=In that case, our interests are aligned and this is the end of the matter. Right?
……啊，確實。=...Ah, true.
而且，\n我也不想和沒幹勁的人同台演出。=Also, I don't want to be on stage with someone who isn't motivated.
對、對不起……=S-sorry...
哈！不愧是{{A}}。\n這職業意識可當真不一般。=Ha! As expected from {{A}}, you are very professional.
說的也是。對{{A}}而言，\n高中學園祭之流哪入得了您的法眼？=That's right. {{A}} would find a high school cultural festival so stupid and unbearable, wouldn't he?
喂，你那是什麼語氣啊……=Hey, what kind of tone is that...
我們也是，才不想跟在工作之餘，\n衝著打發時間來參加社團活動的人……=We're the same, we don't have time for people who just show up to kill time...
一起努力去贏「全戲」呢！=Let's work together to win the "All-Drama"!
等等。\n我對待社團活動一直都很認真的……=Hold on. \nI've always taken club activities seriously...
哈！誰知道呢！=Ha! Who knows!
……「全戲」？=..."All-Drama"?
他們在說什麼？=<size\=26>What are they talking about?</size>
就是「全國高校戲劇大賽」……\n是戲劇部的全國性賽事哦。="National High School Drama Competition"...\nA national drama club competition.
{{A}}，原來戲劇部也有這種比賽呀！={{A}}, so the drama club has competitions like that too!
這……\n你們還真是群門外漢啊。=Wow...\nYou guys are a bunch of amateurs.
這點上我同意{{A}}的意見。\n我們沒法和你們同台。=I agree with {{A}} on this one. we can't be on the same stage as you.
那這件事就當沒發生過吧。\n{{A}}，害我們白跑一趟。=Let's just pretend this never happened. {{A}}, we've come all this way for nothing.
等……等等！=W-Wait!
怎麼了，{{A}}？=What's wrong, {{A}}?
請等一下。\n這……這樣我會很為難的。=Please wait. \nTh-this would put me in a really tough spot.
……阿？=...Huh?
我想看他們演「{{A}}」！=I want to see them play "{{A}}"!
等等，{{A}}，\n你這也太突然了吧？=Wait. What's wrong all of a sudden, {{A}}?
才、才不突然呢。我一走進這間屋子……\n第一眼看到他們時，我就……=N-not sudden at all... When I walked into this room... no, the instant I saw them, I...
我就來了靈感……！=I'm struck with inspiration...!
你們幾個，真的很符合{{A}}的感覺！=You guys fit the image of {{A}} perfectly!
你是……{{A}}……\n不，你是{{A}}的妹妹！=You are... The protagonist...\nNo, you are the protagonist's little sister!
你……\n沒錯，你跟{{A}}一模一樣！=You are...\nRight, you're exactly like the protagonist!
我、我當{{A}}！？=I-I'm the protagonist!?
而你……\n特別適合演{{A}}的哥哥！=And you... You're perfect for playing the protagonist's older brother!
哥哥！？=Older brother!?
我不演{{A}}嗎？=<size\=24>I'm not playing the protagonist?</size>
沒錯，哥哥！=Right, older brother!
而你……你的話……你是……=And you... you are... you are...
是{{A}}他們的……媽媽！=The protagonist's... mother!
媽媽！？=Mother!?
我……要給他們提供原作。\n希望{{A}}的戲劇部也能配合他們。=I... want to provide them with an original script. I hope the {{A}} drama club will cooperate with them.
{{A}}\n不不不，為啥事情會變成這樣！={{A}} No no no, how did things end up like this!?
他們看上去沒什麼演出經驗……\n所以得好好指導一下。=Since they seem to be beginners when it comes to acting... We'll have to teach them a lot.
要是不願幫忙的話，\n以後{{A}}戲劇部就不能再用我的原作……！=If you don't cooperate, I won't let the {{A}} drama club use my original work anymore...!
啥！？=Huh!?
你們本來是打算用我的短篇，\n來當作東京預賽的作品對吧？=You were planning to use one of my short pieces for the Tokyo competition, right?
我不同意了。=I don't agree anymore.
等、等等等等！{{A}}！？\n為啥做得這麼絕！？=W-wait! {{A}}!? \nWhy are you being so extreme!?
是、是因為……靈感來了。=I-it's because... I got inspired.
……真受不了你們這些想一齣是一齣的天才！=...I can't stand you geniuses and your random whims.
啊——好吧！=Argh- fine!
{{A}}，你來指導{{B}}的人吧。={{A}}, you coach the {{B}} students.
……我？=...Me?
本來{{B}}就是衝著你跟{{A}}來的。\n我們只是配角罷了，對吧？={{B}} only needed you and {{A}}. We're just an afterthought, right?
沒、沒有，沒那回事……！=N-no, not at all...!
我們把{{A}}留給你們。{{B}}，\n反正只要有人留下教他們，你就滿意了吧？=We'll leave {{A}} to you. {{B}}, as long as someone stays to teach them, you're satisfied, right?
嗯。我只要跟他們一起……=Yes. As long as I'm with them...
能跟他們一起合作就可以。=Being able to collaborate with them is fine.
好好，那就這麼定了！\n那我們也能集中精力準備大賽了。=Okay. Then it's settled. We'll focus on practicing for the competition.
喂，等等。\n我也要參加比賽的……！=Hey, wait a minute. \nI'm in the competition too...!
……本來就沒安排你的角色哦。\n怕你到時候突然來工作，放我們鴿子呢。=...There's no role for you in the first place. We were worried you'd bail on us last minute because of work.
就這麼說定了。\n{{A}}的同學們，合演加油哦～！=Well then, students of {{A}}, good luck with the joint play～!
那、那個！十分抱歉……！\n{{A}}也不用勉強留下的……=Umm! I'm so sorry...! But {{A}}, you don't have to stay...
那可不行。如果{{A}}也走了，\n合演就辦不成了吧。=That's no good. If {{A}} also leaves, this whole deal might fall apart, right?
我……想和你們一起演出。=I... would like to perform with you.
行吧。要是你鬧彆扭不讓用原作的話，\n戲劇部那邊也不好辦。=I get it. If you get upset and we can't use the script, it'll be a problem for the drama club.
不過，既然決定要演，\n希望大家能認真對待這個舞臺。=But now that we've committed to this, I want everyone to take this stage seriously.
請放心！\n畢竟這是我們的學園祭！=Don't worry!\nIt's our school festival after all!
Bene（好的），那從明天起，\n每天放學後我都會過來。=Bene (Well), starting tomorrow, \nI'll stop by here after school.
我也是……\n只要沒有工作，每天都會來……！=Me too... \nI'll come here every day unless I have work...!
等等{{A}}！我也要演嗎？\n而且是演老媽！？=Wait a minute, {{A}}! Am I really going to be on stage too? And as a mom!
應、應該吧。說{{A}}你跟媽媽角色特別符合。\n雖然我也不懂為什麼……=Well, I'm not sure why, but it seems like {{A}} perfectly fits the image of a mother...
到底哪裡符合了啊……=What kind of image is that...
{{A}}的媽媽，\n明明是個溫柔美麗又顧家的角色。=The mother of {{A}} is a kind, beautiful, and homely character.
雖然看到後面，會發現其實實力超強。=As the story progresses, it turns out that she was actually super strong.
拉麵才能被相中了？=<size\=29>Noticed your ramen skills?</size>
{{A}}的溫柔被看穿了？=<size\=29>Saw through {{A}}'s kindness?</size>

Choice 1
是哦是哦，我做拉麵的家庭要素，\n跟老媽的家庭感有了呼應——=That's right. The homey feel of making ramen is what makes me think of my mother-
——才怪啊！\n都不知道該怎麼吐槽了！！=-No way! Don't make me point out how weird that is!!
Choice 2
嗯、嗯！？\n什麼啊……我都被你講到害羞了……=Um, huh!? What's up with that... \nIt's embarrassing...
不對！她一句話都沒跟我說過，\n怎麼可能知道我其實很溫柔！？=No! She hasn't even talked to me, there's no way she could know something like that!?

我還沒看過{{A}}呢。\n{{B}}他們一家……跟我們很像嗎？=I haven't read {{A}} yet. Are the protagonist and his family... like us?
我想想……{{A}}的故事是：\n三兄妹成了怪盜、去調查案件真相什麼的。=Let's see... the story is about three siblings who become Phantom Thieves and investigate the truth behind a certain incident.
{{A}}是活潑的女高中生，有個聰明哥哥，\n還有個弱氣但有超能力的妹妹……=The protagonist is a lively high school girl, with a smart older brother, and a timid but mysteriously powerful little sister...
{{A}}和弱氣妹妹……\n我覺得怎麼也對不上啊。={{A}} and the timid little sister...\nI just can't see the resemblance.
唔，有意思。\n也許是她身為作者獨有的看法……=Hm, that's interesting. \nMaybe it's just the author's perspective...
總之，演出都已經定了，\n我們就好好努力，別再讓{{A}}難堪吧。=Anyway, we're stuck doing the play now. so let's do our best and not disrespect {{A}}!
sr:"^(.*)跟(.*)也是，\n要一起加油哦！$"="$1 and $2 too, \nlet's work hard together!"

一起表演吧=Let's perform together

雷厲風行的女子=Decisive Girl
不行不行！\n推只能遠觀不可褻玩！=No way! Just watching my favorite is enough for me!
啊？啥意思？=Huh? What does that even mean?
替我們和{{A}}說聲加油啦！\n我們會全力支持他的！=Please cheer on Ikenami-kun for us! We'll support him with everything we've got!
那什麼，我們也到社團活動的時間了！\n得趕快過去！=Anyway, it's time for our club activities! Gotta run!
一定要向{{A}}問好哦～\n下次我們會帶貢品來的～=Next time we'll bring some gifts～ \nPlease say hi to Ikenami-kun for us～
不是，帶禮品不如直接來幫忙演啊……=Nah, forget the gifts and cheering, \njust come help us perform instead...
……哼，原來如此。=...Hmph, I see.
看來有人需要「{{A}}」的幫助呢……\n再暗中觀察一陣吧。=Looks like someone's in need of the "Chosen One's" help... I'll observe a bit more from the shadows.
辛苦了，{{A}}。\n……還有{{B}}。=Good work, {{A}}.\n...And you too, {{B}}.
外面好誇張。\n聚集了一大堆來看{{A}}的女生。=It's crazy out there. There were a lot of girls who came to see Ikenami-san.
好像是吧，承蒙大家厚愛。=It seems so, I'm grateful for it.
哈？還真官方啊。\n連說客套話也不失帥哥氣場。=Huh? The way you brush it off so smoothly, \nno wonder you're so cool.
最近的粉絲……\n似乎只是從那些爆紅的影片了解我。=But the recent fans... \nonly know me from those viral videos.
但說真心話，\n希望他們也能看看舞臺上的我。=To be honest, I hope they can see me on the stage too.
影片？=Video?
舞臺？=Stage?
嗯，我的主戰場是在舞臺上。\n雖然都只是些小劇場公演。=Yes, my real battleground is the stage, but I only perform in small theaters.
前不久，一家雜誌社採訪過我，\n然後在SNS上發了我彩排的影片……=Not long ago, a magazine company came to interview me and posted a video of me practicing on the SNS...
不知道為什麼就紅了，\n所以我現在才這麼受歡迎。=It seems that went viral, \nand I owe my current popularity to that.
我本來希望大家能多關注我的舞臺……\n不過也不能奢求吧。=I actually wanted to be noticed for my stage work... but I guess that's asking too much.
那個，這是舞臺劇的劇本……\n我寫完了。=Um, this is the script for the play... It's finished.
{{B}}？這算是{{A}}的最新作品吧！？\n一天時間就寫完了！？太厲害了！={{B}}? This is {{A}}'s latest work!? And you wrote it in a single day!? That's amazing!
是的，我滿腦子都是你們的樣子……\n結果一不留神，一晚上就寫完了。=Yes, I was overwhelmed with your images... Before I knew it, I had written it all in one night.
不過，只有5個演員還是不太夠。\n還有很多其他角色沒人演……=But no matter what, five people just aren't enough. We've still got several roles left uncast...
也對，不止是主角團，\n還需要有人演敵對方才行。=That's true, besides the main cast, we need people to play the antagonists too.
嗯……我應該可以分飾多角。\n不過就算這樣，也至少還缺1到2人。=Hmm... I could probably take on multiple roles. But even then, we're still short by at least one or two people.
而且還需要工作人員。\n音效、燈光，總不能讓演員自己來。=You also need staff. Sound and lighting have to be separate from the actors.
對哦，幕後的工作人員……\n要不然我問問其他{{A}}們？=Oh right, backstage staff... How about I ask some of the other {{A}}s?
嗯，拜託了。\n那我們就先以目前的演員開始排練吧？=Yes, I'd appreciate that. Let's begin rehearsing with the current cast?

首先從朗讀劇本開始。\n大家都念一下自己的臺詞吧。=We'll begin with a table read. \nGo ahead and deliver your lines one by one.

不對，我做拉麵也是看著師父學會的！\n所以只有多試試才知道行不行吧？=For ramen, I learned the techniques from my master by watching him, guess you learn everything by practicing?

沒錯，只有自己多念臺詞，身體力行……=Exactly. You have to keep practicing your lines, put it into action...
在心裡慢慢深化對角色的解讀，\n才能真正演好這個「人」。=Only by deeply understanding the character can you truly become "them" on stage.
一開始演不好沒關係，\n我們繼續對臺詞吧。=It's okay to be bad at first. \nLet's continue the table read.

那就好。\n表演，讓自己開心才最重要嘛。=That's the most important thing. \nActing is about having fun.
那明天也同一時間，如何？=So, same time tomorrow, how about it?

真的沒關係。跟大家在一起，\n我也能湧現出更多漫畫靈感……=It's really fine. Being with you all gives me ideas and inspiration for my manga...
還有，我才高一，比大家都小，\n就不要對我用「您」啦。=Also, I'm a first-year student and younger than you all, so there's no need to call me "san".
是嗎？\n那那～我可以叫你{{A}}嗎？=Really? Then～ can I just call you {{A}}?
{{B}}，突然就叫{{A}}……={{B}}, calling me {{A}} all of a sudden...

{{B}}？那個是{{A}}吧？\n他怎麼還沒走？={{B}}? That's Ikenami-san, right? \nWhy hasn't he left yet?
她們是……在體育館圍觀的那幾個吧。\n哦，應該是被粉絲堵住了。=They're the ones... watching at the gym, right? Oh, he must've been blocked by fans.
{{B}}～謝謝你的簽名，{{A}}！\n我要當成傳家寶！={{B}}～ Thank you for the autograph, Ikenami-kun! I'm going to treat it like a family heirloom!

Choice 2
他可是從剛才離開後一直困在那裡哦……\n總之，我去打個招呼解圍吧。=He's been stuck there ever since he left... Anyway, I'll go say hi and help him out.

{{B}}……{{A}}？\n你為什麼會在這裡……={{B}}... {{A}}? Why are you here...
叫做{{A}}的女性=Woman Called {{A}}
{{A}}，你的情況我可清楚得很～\n我不是說過會「一直關注著你」嘛？={{A}}, I know everything about you～ \nDidn't I say I would "keep an eye on you"?
我說，你們幾個！\n是{{A}}的粉絲吧？給我自重一點。=You few! Are you a fan of {{A}}? \nControl yourselves.
{{A}}現在是事業關鍵期，\n任何私生活照片都不能隨便流出。={{A}} is in a critical period for his career, so even a single photo leaking would be problematic.

難道是，{{A}}事務所的人？=Could it be, someone from Ikenami-kun's agency?

所以您如果要採訪，\n我也沒什麼能回答的……=So, even if you come to interview me, \nI can't answer any questions...
哎呀，那可不對哦。\n你現在是正當紅的演員呢。=Ara, that's not right, dear. You are a rising actor!
出演外校的舞臺劇也是正兒八經的工作喲！\n可不能放過展示魅力的機會。=Performing in other schools is a serious business! Don't miss the opportunity to show your charm.

總覺得……\n這個人比剛剛那些粉絲更難纏？=I feel like... Is this person even more clingy than those fans earlier?
好像是跟工作相關的……\n不過{{A}}看起來不太喜歡她？=It seems to be work-related... But {{A}} doesn't seem to like her very much?
打個招呼=Say hi
把他撈出來=Get him out
r:"^我也覺得！我們上，(.*)。$"="I think so too! Let's go, $1."

是{{A}}的主意=It's {{A}}'s idea
{{A}}也被騙到啦？=Even fooled {{A}}?
原來是這樣……？{{A}}！=I see...? {{A}}!
{{B}}！Bravo！！\n你這不是挺有表演天賦的嘛，{{A}}！={{B}}! Bravo!! \nYou have a real talent for acting, {{A}}!
{{A}}，好像變了個人似的……={{A}}, feels completely different...
啊，抱歉……\n{{A}}，一放鬆下來，不小心就這樣了。=Ah, sorry... {{A}}, I'm just relieved, that's all.
看來，\n我們把你從那裡帶出來是對的呢。=It seems that it was the right decision to get you out of there.
畢竟對方好像和你有工作往來，\n我們還在猶豫要不要這麼做呢。=After all, she seemed like someone you knew from work, so we were a little hesitant.
{{A}}，幸好你們替我解圍，幫大忙了。={{A}}, you helped me out, thank you.
那人是個雜誌主編。\n不知為何似乎很支持我。=That person is a magazine editor-in-chief. For some reason, she seems to really support me.
她能寫我的報導，我自然很感激。\n但約我吃飯什麼的就……=I appreciate her writing articles about me. \nBut I don't like being invited to dinner...
{{A}}～原來如此……={{A}}～ I see...
{{A}}……\n果然娛樂圈的人際關係很難處理啊……={{A}}... Being a celebrity is hard...
對。\n而且她的雜誌很有影響力，不敢得罪她啊。=Right. And her magazine is very influential, \nI dare not offend her.
我之前不是說，\n我是因為排練的影片才爆紅的嗎？=I said before, I went viral because of the rehearsal video, right?
上傳那個影片的，就是她。\n之後還很周到地立刻讓我上了雜誌。=She was the one who posted it. And she was kind enough to feature me in a magazine afterwards.
原來是她的功勞=It's all thanks to her
是你的伯樂啊=She saw your potential
嗯……可以這麼說。=Yes... You can say that.
但我並不想以這種方式出名，\n所以心情很複雜。=I wasn't exactly thrilled with how this fame came about, so it's complicated.
不過從那之後，就來了很多電視臺的機會，\n也算好事吧。=But after that, I started getting way more opportunities from the TV station. Guess it worked out in the end.
哇，這不是很厲害嘛！=Wow, isn't that amazing!
但是……說實在的，\n我本打算今年不接戲了。=But... to be honest, I was planning to cut back on acting jobs this year.
{{A}}？為什麼？={{A}}? Why?
畢竟是高中最後一年了……\n我想把精力都放在戲劇部的全戲上。=Since it's my final year in high school... I wanted to focus everything on the club's All-Drama.
但我又拒絕不了{{A}}介紹的工作……\n結果給戲劇部添了很多麻煩。=I couldn't turn down {{A}}'s offer, \nso I ended up burdening the drama club.
所以才跟部長他們有矛盾啊？=So that's why things got awkward with the club president and the others?
他們真的都非常努力。\n所以在他們眼裡，我顯得有些飄吧。=They all work really hard. \nSo I guess I look frivolous.
哎。比起繼續給大家添麻煩，\n還不如放棄社團，專心接工作呢……=Sigh... I should probably just quit the club and focus on work instead of being a burden.
哎呀，不小心說多了。\n抱歉啊，盡說些喪氣話。=Ah, I talked too much. \nSorry for venting like that.
總之剛才真的幫大忙了。\n謝謝大家。=Seriously, you guys saved me back there.\nThank you, everyone.
客氣啥，{{A}}！\n以後有事隨時叫我們，不用客氣。=If anything else happens, \nplease don't hesitate to ask, {{A}}!
……那個，{{A}}，\n你從剛才起就一直在畫什麼呢？=...Hey, {{A}}, what have you been drawing?
我在畫素描。\n我覺得剛才的事很有意思，所以……=I am sketching. \nThat commotion earlier was intriguing, so...
哇，畫得好棒……！\n不愧是{{A}}！=Wow, that's great...! \nAs expected from {{A}}!
我也畫了大家排練的樣子。=I also drew everyone rehearsing.
哇……好厲害。\n不過畫這個能派上什麼用場嗎？=Wow... that's amazing. \nBut what use is there in drawing this?
沒什麼特別的目的……\n就只是單純想畫而已。=No particular reason...\nI just wanted to draw.
只要看到你們，我就會有很多靈感……\n所以就都畫下來了。=Just seeing you all gives me all sorts of ideas... so I've been sketching them down, that's all.
想到好點子了？=Got any good ideas?
能把我們畫進漫畫裡嗎？=Can you put us in the it?

Choice 1
嗯，是的。\n感覺對後面做分鏡也很有幫助。=Yes. Feels like this will really help with the storyboarding later too.
Choice 2
那個嘛……可能不會直接畫進去，\n但會以大家為原型改編一下。=Well... It won't be exactly like you, but there may be some scenes based on you.

{{B}}，好害羞呀，\n被{{A}}當做素材了～！={{B}}, I'm so embarrassed, \n{{A}} used me as a reference～!
那麼各位，剛才那位女士已經走了，\n我們也差不多回去吧。=Well everyone, that woman is gone now, \nit's time for us to go home.

2nd Rehearsal

對了，\n你們什麼時候開始做大型道具啊？=By the way, \nwhen do you guys make the big props?

比如家庭場景的桌子椅子之類，\n感覺是必需的吧？=For example, a table set for a scene inside the house.
啊～那個啊！\n那些也得我們自己做嗎？=Ah～ Those!\nDo we have to make those ourselves?
那我們是不是還得準備服裝？=Do we need to prepare costumes as well?

還需要勇氣！=And courage!

Choice 1
要操心的事情好多啊……=There are so many things to worry about...
{{A}}，這些後臺的雜事也太多了吧？\n這樣還能來得及嗎……={{A}}, that's too much backstage work, right? \nWill we even make it in time...
Choice 2
的確！勇氣也很重要呢！=Of course! Courage is also important!
{{A}}……雖然但是，那什麼……\n竟然沒人負責吐槽嗎？={{A}}... Wait, seriously... Is no one going to call out how ridiculous this is?
{{A}}，這麼一盤算，雜事也太多了吧？\n還能來得及嗎……={{A}}, that's too much backstage work, right? \nWill we even make it in time...

總之，我們盤點一下都需要什麼吧。\n{{A}}，你對佈景有沒有想法？=Anyway, let's start by listing what we need. {{A}}, do you have any ideas for the set design?
我在寫劇本的時候稍微想過，\n需要安排的場景有……=Yes, actually, I've been thinking about it while writing the script. The key scenes we'll need are...
唔……原來如此。\n這樣就能控制佈景成本……=Hmm... I see. \nThis will keep the cost of the set in check...
既然是學園祭，學校應該會提供幕布吧？\n有幕布的話就可以模擬出各種情景了。=Since it's the school festival, we can borrow blackout curtains from the school, right? We could stage all kinds of scenes with those.
嗯，每個小組至少可以申請5張幕布。\n其他的就得跟執行委員爭取一下了……=Yes, each group can apply for at least five curtains. The rest will depend on how negotiations go with the committee members...
這件事就交給我吧。=Leave this matter to me.
真靠得住！\n那剩下的就是……=So reliable! \nThen what's left is...
Bene（好）！差不多都安排好了，\n等實際進行的時候再微調吧！=Bene (Good)! We'll tweak things as we go, \nbut the framework's there!
今天就先買零散的小道具吧！\n去{{A}}如何？=Let's buy some small props today! \nHow about going to {{A}}?
{{B}}！\n{{A}}，你今天很嗨啊！={{B}}! Ikenami-san, you're really excited today!
{{A}}，有嗎……？={{A}}, really...?
這不挺好的嘛？說明你很開心！\n那就一起去{{A}}吧！=Isn't that great? It means you're having fun!\nCome on, let's go to {{A}} together!

哎呀，是{{A}}！=Ara, it's {{A}}!
真巧呀！\n沒想到在這裡都能遇見{{A}}呢！=What a coincidence! \nWho would've thought I'd meet {{A}} here!
{{A}}？她不是上次那個……={{A}}? Isn't she the person from last time...
這些學生是？\n都穿著{{A}}的校服呢。=Who are these students? \nThey are all wearing {{A}} uniforms.
是學園祭演出的夥伴，\n一起來置辦道具什麼的……=We are teammates in the school festival performance, just buy props together...
哎呀，挺好的挺好的。\n這種青春時代的日常，感覺能火喲。=Ara, how lovely. \nThis fleeting youthfulness will surely trend.
請別拍照，{{A}}！\n他們只是普通的學生！=Please don't take pictures, {{A}}! They are just normal students!
沒事的呀～我會好好打碼的啦。=Don't worry～ I'll blur it properly.
抱歉，請不要拍攝本校的學生。\n也請不要拍{{A}}，他正在社團活動中。=Sorry, but please refrain from taking photos of our students. The same goes for Ikenami-kun during club activities.
……真自以為是啊。\n你以為誰喜歡拍你們呢。=...How self-important. \nAs if anyone wants to photograph you.
光站在那兒就很礙眼了，知道嗎？\n既不上鏡又不好看，啥也不是。=Your presence alone is intolerable. Must I spell out how utterly devoid of charm or worth you are?
光站在那裡就很礙眼了，知道嗎？\n既不上鏡又不好看，啥也不是。=Your presence alone is intolerable. Must I spell out how utterly devoid of charm or worth you are?
我說你們幾個，\n別隨隨便便靠近{{A}}。=To put it bluntly, I'd appreciate it if you didn't go anywhere near {{A}}.
跟這些來歷不明的女人站一起，\n要是被八卦雜誌拍到……=What if you were caught with some random girls, the gossip magazines will have a field day...
會耽誤{{A}}的前途，懂？\n你們負得起這個責任嗎，啊？=You'd be tarnishing {{A}}'s future, do you understand? Tell me, can you even bear that responsibility?
啊？負責？=Huh? Responsibility?
總之，不許你們跟{{A}}走得太近。=Let me be clear, don't you dare act familiar with {{A}}.
這年頭，普通人也可能被網暴哦？\n你們也不想自己被網暴吧？=In this day and age, even ordinary people can fall victim to dogpiling. Surely, you wouldn't want that, would you?
這年頭，普通人也可能被網暴哦！\n你們也不想自己被網暴吧？=In this day and age, even ordinary people can fall victim to dogpiling. Surely, you wouldn't want that, would you?
那是啥，錄音筆……？\n意思是不聽你的話，我們就要被網暴？=What is that, a voice recorder...? Meaning if we don't comply, we will be dogpiled online?
喂，我說你！差不多得了！=Hey, I'm telling you! That's enough!
哎呀，我瞧瞧……=Ara, let me have a look...
雖然有些粗野，但身材、肌肉都不錯呢。\n好好打磨一下，說不定有戲哦？=A little rough around the edges, but you've got an athletic build with solid muscle definition. With some polish, you really could shine.
雖然有些粗野，但身材、肌肉都不錯呢。\n好好打磨一下，說不定有戲哦！=A little rough around the edges, but you've got an athletic build with solid muscle definition. With some polish, you really could shine!
{{A}}！？\n你你你、你幹什麼！={{A}}!? Wh-What are you doing!
這邊這位也……{{A}}，臉蛋很可愛呢。\n小帥哥，娛樂圈了解一下？=And you... {{A}}, you've got such a cute face. Hey handsome, ever thought about showbiz?
別碰我=Don't touch me
{{A}}，沒興趣={{A}}, not interested
有點意思……=Interesting...
等等……！=Wait...!
秘書模樣的美青年=Young Secretary
{{A}}，他們只是普通學生。\n而且這裡人多眼雜，還請到此為……={{A}}, they are just normal students. And there are too many people here, please...
阿？？=Huh??
你在對我提意見？\n喂，你剛剛是在對我提意見嗎？？=Did you just criticize me? \nHey, are you actually criticizing me??
啊，不是……！\n但、畢竟對方是未成年，那個……=Ah, no...! \nBut, given that they're minors, umm...
{{A}}～我好不容易打算提拔你，\n來代替之前那個蠢貨的。={{A}}～ I went out of my way to promote you, replacing that worthless trash.
你明白自己的身份嗎？\n你是被我撿到的，什麼來著……=Do you even know your place? \nYou're nothing but a stray I took in...
「狗」，對吧？=A "dog", right?
我最煩咬{{A}}的狗了。懂嗎？=I can't stand dogs that bite. You know that, don't you?
失、失禮了，{{A}}……=S-Sorry, {{A}}...
{{A}}。知道就行，啊。={{A}}. As long as you understand.
喂！\n你也太過分了吧！？=Hey!\nIsn't that too far!?
阿？=Huh?
沒事、沒關係的！=Fine, it's fine!
{{A}}，身為您的狗，\n我做了不該做的事，真的非常抱歉。={{A}}, though I am your dog, I have betrayed your trust. I am deeply ashamed.
等等，你難道是……？=Wait, are you...?
好好。那個，{{A}}？\n待會兒你有時間吧？=Alright. Well, {{A}}?\nDo you have time later?
好好。那個，{{A}}？\n等等你有時間吧？=Alright. Well, {{A}}?\nDo you have time later?
機會難得，一起喝個茶怎麼樣？\n這附近有間很好的茶室哦。=Since it's such a nice occasion, shall we share some tea? I know a lovely place close by.
{{A}}，其實我……={{A}}, actually I...
不，那就陪您一起去吧……=No, I'll go with you...
抱歉，我先失陪了。\n下次再一起買東西吧。=Sorry, I have to excuse myself. \nLet's go shopping next time.
不，可是……！=No, but...!
你沒必要跟她走=You don't have to go
跟我們在一起就行=Just stay with us
沒事的……\n抱歉啊，你們先回去吧。=It's fine...\nSorry, go home for today.
……好、好吧。=...O-Okay.
我們走吧，{{A}}。=Let's go, {{A}}.
{{B}}，我好開心呀，{{A}}！\n來！跟我來！={{B}}, I'm so happy, {{A}}!\nHere! Follow me!
他們走了……\n{{A}}為什麼突然……=They left... Why would {{A}}...
話說，那個叫{{A}}的是怎麼回事啊！\n怎麼那麼拽……=Also, what's wrong with that {{A}}! \nWhy is she acting all high and mighty...
但{{A}}看起來是不是有點怪？\n感覺是看到那個男人之後才答應去的……=But didn't Ikenami-kun seem off? It was like he only agreed after seeing that man...
那傢伙……被盜取了。=He's... been stolen.
不，準確說是「他們」都被盜了。=No, to be precise, "they".
吾之前沒發現{{A}}的異樣，\n但在他與那個{{B}}接觸後就很明顯了。=I couldn't read {{A}} before, but it became glaringly obvious after he interacted with {{B}}.
{{A}}，還有剛才那個男人……\n他們很有可能都被{{B}}「奪走了」慾望。={{A}}, and that man... most likely had their desires "stolen" by {{B}}.
怎麼會這樣……=How could this happen...
大家怎麼了？\n為什麼都盯著貓頭鷹看……=What's wrong, everyone? \nWhy are you all staring at the owl...
啊、沒！那個……\n因為它剛才說了……=Ah, no! Umm...\nBecause it said...
喂，{{A}}！\n{{B}}根本聽不到他的聲音吧……！=Hey, {{A}}!\n{{B}} can't him...!
啊，{{A}}～對！\n{{B}}……=Ah, ahhh～ Right!\n{{B}}...
貓頭鷹餓了……=The owl is hungry...
貓頭鷹尿了……=The owl peed...

Choice 1
{{A}}，原來透過叫聲就能明白啊。\n我待會兒要記下來……={{A}}, you can tell by the sound it makes. \nI'll make a note of that later...
{{A}}，原來透過叫聲就能明白啊。\n我等等要記下來……={{A}}, you can tell by the sound it makes. \nI'll make a note of that later...
Choice 2
尿、尿、尿了！？=P-P-Peed!?
那真是……不得了啊！\n你的包沒事嗎？=That's... really bad! \nIs your bag okay?

那個……他、他還要照顧寵物，\n我們就先解散吧。=Umm... h-he still has to take care of his pet, \nso let's call it a day now.
也是。反正{{A}}不在，\n我們也不知道該買什麼。=Right. Anyway, since {{A}} isn't here, we don't know what to buy.
那我去一趟畫材店就回家了。\n各位再見。=Well, I'm going to stop by the art supply store and then head home. Goodbye, everyone.
sr:"^(.*)……好險啊……\n抱歉(.*)，多虧你反應快……$"="$1... That was close... Sorry $2, thanks for the quick response..."
要是你說漏嘴了，\n我們會被當成怪胎的……=If you slip up, we'll be be treated as weirdos...
對了，{{A}}，\n你剛才說{{B}}被偷走慾望的事……=Right, {{A}}, you mentioned that {{B}}'s desires were stolen...
稍等，{{A}}，這裡人太多了。\n而且話題還關乎幕後黑手……=Wait, {{A}}, let's not talk about it in such a crowded place. This is about the mastermind...
啊，說的也是。=Ah, that's true.
明天午休的時候再細聊吧，{{A}}。=Let's talk more about this during lunch break tomorrow, {{A}}.
嗯，吾知道了。\n明天在基地集合吧。=Yes, I understand. \nLet's meet at the hideout tomorrow.

----------
Day After Meeting Daichi
----------
{{A}}，關於昨天你說的……=So, {{A}}, about what you said yesterday...
{{A}}是被偷走了慾望嗎？\n被那個……叫{{B}}的人？=Has {{A}}'s desires had his stolen? \nBy that... {{B}}?
唔，沒錯。=Yes, correct.
前些天，那個女人在校門口跟他糾纏時，\n吾就有些在意了……=The other day, when that woman and him were arguing, I felt uneasy...
然後透過昨天的事，吾確信了，\n{{A}}是被奪走了慾望。=After yesterday's incident, I'm convinced that {{A}} has his desires stolen.
還有昨天{{A}}帶著的那個男人也是。=The same goes for the man {{A}} was with yesterday.
那個男人也是！？=That man too!?
說起來昨天那個男人……\n跟之前在校門口見到的不是一個人吧。=By the way, the man we saw yesterday... was different from the one we saw at the school gate before.
嗯！確實不是同一個。\n難道她每天都換秘書嗎……？=Yes! It's definitely not the same. Does she change her secretary every day...?
還說了傷人的話=Even said harsh words
還叫他是狗呢=Even called him a dog

對，不光說他是「狗」，態度還很粗暴。\n與其說是秘書……=Right, not only did she call him a "dog", but she was also really harsh with him. He's less like a secretary...
不如說是「服侍」她的人。=And more like someone "serving" her.
太過分了……那這樣說的話，\n再之前的那個男人也被奪走了慾望……？=That's just too far... If that's the case, does that mean the previous man's desires were also stolen...?
唔，有可能。=Hmm, it's possible.
為什麼他們要忍下去啊？\n都那樣了，還不如直接辭職好了！=Why would they put up with it? At that point, they might as well just quit!
我想起來了，\n她好像說過「撿到你」之類的話吧。=Come to think of it, \nshe say something like "I took you in".
也許，是被她抓住了什麼把柄呢……=Maybe she's got some kind of leverage over them...
不管怎麼說，\n那個叫{{A}}的就是下一個{{B}}吧？=Either way, that {{A}} woman must be the next {{B}}, right?
唔，可能性很高，\n因為吾都能直接感受到慾望的榨取了。=Hmm, it's highly likely, I can practically feel the draining of desires myself.
有必要去{{B}}確認一下。\n如果能知道{{A}}的全名……=We should check {{B}} to confirm. If we can find out {{A}}'s full name...
{{A}}說過她是雜誌社的編輯吧。\n網上搜搜看。={{A}} mentioned she's a magazine editor. \nLet's search online.
找到了……「{{A}}」。\n上面說是「週刊BAKURO」的主編。=Found her... "{{A}}". It says she's the editor-in-chief of "Weekly BAKURO".
BAKURO好像是那個，\n經常曝光藝人醜聞的雜誌吧？=Isn't BAKURO that magazine that's always exposing celebrity scandals?
對，是「{{A}}」出版的所謂爆料雜誌。=Yes, it's a gossip magazine published by "{{A}}".
上面有她的照片，肯定沒錯了。\n她本人似乎也很有名呢。=There's a photo of his face, so there's no doubt about it. She seems to be quite famous.
很有名？=Famous?
她是個精明的主編，似乎手握很多猛料。\n採訪她本人的文章點擊率也很高。=She's a talented editor-in-chief with many high-profile scoops. Articles featuring her interviews get a lot of clicks too.
不過……也有很多譴責她的聲音。\n比如，經常有被她爆料的人起訴她。=But... she also gets a lot of backlash. For example, people she's exposed often sue her.
被起訴？說她虛假報導嗎？=Sued? So her articles were fake?
嗯……\n但暫時沒搜到她輸官司的文章……=Yes... But I'm not finding any articles about her losing a case yet...
畢竟{{A}}是家大型出版社，\n他們應該有很優秀的律師吧。={{A}} is a major publisher. They probably have really good lawyers.
即使文章有不實內容，\n也很難在訴訟上贏過她吧。=Even if her articles are outright false, winning a lawsuit against her might be tough.
聽起來感覺很可怕啊……\n好像有很多內幕。=Sounds pretty sketchy... Feels like there is something shady going on.
如果只是寫文章，也構不成犯罪吧……\n啊，她有沒有被當成{{A}}投過稿？=Just writing articles isn't a crime... Ah, has anyone ever posted her as a {{A}}?
我也這麼想……=I was thinking the same thing...
{{A}}的導航頁上有她的名字，\n好像確實被投過。=Her name shows up on {{A}}, so someone must've posted.
但是……似乎沒有被官方認證過，\n那個投稿也已經刪了，看不到了。=But... it doesn't seem to be officially certified, and that post has already been deleted, so we can't see it.
被刪了……？=Deleted...?
難道，是{{A}}為了遮醜讓刪除的……？=Maybe {{A}} had it deleted as a cover-up...?
{{A}}，評論區裡也都這麼想呢。={{A}}, the comments section seems to think so too.
有人說是迫於{{A}}的壓力被刪了……=Some say it was removed due to pressure from {{A}}...
還有人說「{{A}}不可能向媒體妥協，\n不過是投稿者害怕了所以自己刪了」。=Others claim "{{A}} would never bend to the media, the poster got scared and deleted it themselves".
……不管怎樣，\n看來她是個爭議不斷的人物啊。=...Either way, she's clearly the kind of person constantly shrouded in shady rumors.
{{B}}？\n{{A}}，大家快看這個報導！={{B}}? Hey everyone, look at this article!
好像是{{B}}寫的……\n關於{{A}}的文章吧？=It's written by {{B}}... about {{A}}, right?
真是他……\n雖然照片上的眼睛打碼了，但確實是{{A}}！=It's really him... Even with the eyes blurred in the photo, it's clearly {{A}}!
這篇報導真讓人不舒服……=This article is seriously unsettling...
雖然前面是案件概要和{{A}}過往的劣跡，\n但……=It starts with a case summary and {{A}}'s past misdeeds, but...
是的，後面就慢慢變成了……=Yes, then it gradually shifts into...
「被未婚妻拋棄後A開始發瘋，自暴自棄」\n之類……="After Being Abandoned by His Fiancée, A Spiraled Into Madness and Self-Destruction"...
還有什麼「A的詐騙手段前十名」……="A's Top 10 Scam Techniques"...
把報導故意寫得很吸引眼球……\n但{{A}}也是殺人事件的被害者吧……=It feels like they're making it into a joke... But {{A}} was still a victim in that murder case...
而且，她還對{{A}}迫害過的人們，\n做了追蹤調查……=Also, it seems she is investigating what happened to {{A}}'s victims...
「性騷擾部長的悲慘結局」什麼的，\n這哪是對受害者的寫法啊……=Like "The Tragic Downfall of The Harassed Department Manager", since when is this how you write about victims...
……嗯？大家看這個！=...Huh? Everyone, look at this!
「K高中前不良{{A}}{{B}}現狀」？\n喂，這難道是……="Former Delinquent Turned {{A}} Teacher K"? Hey, isn't this...
這指的難道是……=Could it be...
對啊，這寫的不就是{{A}}嘛！=Right, isn't this about {{A}}!
{{A}}，竟然還有這種報導。\n也虧你們找得到啊。={{A}}, so this is how they're writing about it? Good job tracking this down.
這可不好笑啊，{{A}}！=This isn't funny, {{A}}!
「K以前是個不良，曾是暴走族頭子，\n現在也是校內無人敢惹的{{A}}」……="K was once a delinquent, the leader of a biker gang, and now she's a violent teacher no one can defy"...
「雖然A的懺悔使K免於處分，\n卻致使其學生們仍生活在恐懼之中」……="Though A's repentance spared K from disciplinary action, it left his students living in fear"...
這什麼報導啊，不是瞎說嗎！？\n得找誰檢舉一下吧！=Isn't this article full of lies!? We should report this to someone!
不全是瞎說哦。\n也許現在真的還有害怕我的學生呢……=It's not all lies. There may still be students who are scared of me...
而且曾是不良、受過停職處分，\n還有不准接觸學生這些也都是真的。=And it's true that I was a delinquent, was suspended, and was banned from interacting with students.
不、可是！\n那不都是{{A}}和{{B}}亂下的處分嘛！=No, but! Those were all just unfair punishments handed down by {{A}} and the {{B}}!
嗯，不過……=Yes, but...
大家很害怕、沒有人敢反抗，\n這都是主觀看法吧？=The view of everyone's afraid to oppose, isn't that just a matter of perspective?
相對的，停職和禁止接觸學生的處分，\n則是不爭的事實。=On the other hand, the suspension and student interaction ban, those are solid facts.
這樣的話，\n即使檢舉也很難推翻這篇報導呢。=So even if we report, \nit'd be hard to refute the article.
的確……=Indeed...
他們會說「你實際上就是受到處分了呀」，\n然後事情就不了了之了吧。=I think they'll just say "You really did get disciplined", and that'll be the end of it."
可是！這上面還說{{A}}毆打學生，\n然後學生就得了憂鬱症什麼的，好多謠言！=But! It even says you beat up students, and gave them depression or something, there's so many lies!
……但我確實經常批評大家呢。\n還有上次把打火機當成危險物品沒收的事。=... But I do scold everyone quite often. And there was that incident where I confiscated a lighter as dangerous contraband...
雖然很難過，但也許就有人認為那是暴力，\n然後被嚇壞吧。所以不能說全都是捏造的。=It's upsetting, but maybe some really did see that as violence, and got scared. So I can't say it's a complete fabrication.
雖、雖然是這樣……\n但這種寫法，大家都會誤會的……！=E-Even so... The way it's written, everyone will misunderstand...!
我們可以作證=We can vouch
我們永遠站在{{A}}這邊=<size\=30>We'll always stand by {{A}}</size>
{{A}}，謝謝。\n大家都好溫柔啊。={{A}}, thank you. \nYou are all so kind.
不過我沒事的，\n畢竟有這麼和我感同身受的學生們在呢。=But I'll be fine, after all I have students who understand me well.
而且……\n我被當做{{B}}、登上{{A}}也是事實。=And... it's true that I was labeled a {{B}} appeared on {{A}}.
還有這篇報導沒寫到的，\n我也是引起了不少其他事件的{{A}}呢。=Not to mention... the article didn't mention all the other incidents I cause as a {{A}}.
不管被怎麼潑髒水，我都要去承受。=No matter how much mud they sling at me, I'll bear it.
因為我認為，這也是贖罪的一部分……=Because I believe, this too is part of my atonement...
不過……這麼寫我就算了，\n但對{{A}}的寫法的確有些過分。=But... while they can write whatever they want about me, the way they portrayed {{A}} is too much.
不止{{A}}，\n還隨便消費那些受害者和當事人……=Not just {{A}}, they're shamelessly exploiting all the victims and people involved...
這篇報導並沒有揭開案件的真相，\n反而是對所有當事人的褻瀆。=This article doesn't reveal the truth of the case, it's an insult to all those involved.

可惡！雖然{{A}}說她不在意……\n但我不會原諒{{B}}的！=Damn! Even though {{A}} says she doesn't care... I'll never forgive {{B}}!
暴走族頭子、用恐懼支配學生什麼的……\n寫得太過分了！=What biker gang leader and ruling students through fear... That's too far!
不過，{{A}}的話也可以理解……\n確實還有一些學生感到害怕吧……=But, I can see why {{A}} would say that... There are still students who fear her...
這……也只有遲到或者上課打盹的時候，\n才會害怕她吧！=I mean... the only times she scares me are when I'm late or caught napping in class!
你是慣犯啊？=<size\=28>You're a repeat offender?</size>
原來你嚇得發抖啊……=So you trembled in fear...
也、也就只是高一的時候啦！\n現在上{{A}}的課，我可不敢睡！=Th-That was just in my first year! I'm scared and definitely won't sleep in {{A}}'s class now!
{{A}}，你這不還是害怕嗎。={{A}}, so you are scared after all.
嗯……\n雖然報導裡有客觀事實……=Hmm... While there are some factual elements in the report...
但絕大部分都是誇大其詞。\n真實的部分最多占3成吧。=Most of it is wildly exaggerated. I think only about thirty percent of it is true.
對吧？這簡直無法原諒！=Right? This is absolutely unforgivable!
如果這是{{A}}的慣用做法，\n那之前她報導過的其他醜聞恐怕也……=If this is {{A}}'s usual approach, then all those other scandals she's reported...
基本都是誇大其詞？=Mostly exaggerated?
全部都是捏造？=Completely fabricated?
是基於事實的？=Based on truth?

Choice 1
沒錯，我覺得有可能。=You're right, I think it's possible.
Choice 2
也不能說全是謠言，\n畢竟沒有確切的消息來源也寫不出報導。=We can't say it's all lies either, they must have some source to even write these reports.
只是就像之前說的……\n會刻意地誇大事實，寫成大醜聞。=But like we said earlier... they deliberately exaggerate minor things into huge scandals.
Choice 3
為什麼會如此推論呢。\n反了啦，反了。=Why would you think that. You have it backwards, backwards.
我的意思是，\n有些小事會被刻意地渲染成大醜聞。=I mean they take trivial matters and turn them into huge scandals.
{{A}}！怎麼能那樣！=Eh! How could that be!
對那些被爆料的人，\n今後的人生該怎麼辦啊！？=What about the lives of the people they expose!?
所以她才被起訴的吧？\n啊，不過她也沒輸過啊……=That's why she gets sued, right? \nAh, but she's never lost a case...
{{A}}？等等？那種無良雜誌社，\n出現這種問題不應該馬上倒閉嗎？={{A}}? Wait? How is a scummy magazine like this not bankrupt after all this backlash?
……剛才{{A}}不也說過了嘛？=...Didn't {{A}} just explain?
報導裡有「證據」也有「事實」。=Their reports always mix "evidence" and "facts".
而「捏造」的部分，\n都是些很難被證明的主觀敘述。=As for the "fabricated" parts, most are all subjective impressions or emotional claims.
所以，沒法說它完全是「謠言」。\n就算在法庭上，也是很難被抓住漏洞的。=So you can't call it pure "libel". Even in court, their wording slips through loopholes.
而且吾記得，無論金錢還是時間，\n打官司對原告的負擔都很大吧？=As I recall, lawsuits demand enormous time and money from plaintiffs, right?
如果沒有絕對的勝算……\n應該很多人都堅持不到最後吧……=Without guaranteed victory... \nmost people just give up halfway through...
此外，在漫長的官司結束後，\n公眾早就把這件事忘得一乾二淨了。=Moreover, by the time the long trial is over, the public has completely forgotten about it.
除非是特別重大的事件，\n否則就算輸了也不會損害雜誌的形象。=Unless it's a massive case, losing won't even tarnish the magazine's reputation.
而且，即使真的輸掉了一些官司……=And, even if they lose some cases...
如果雜誌的銷量因此變高，\n那對公司非但沒有損失，反而算盈利了。=If it boosts their sales, \nthe company profits anyway.
所以才寫些假報導？=<size\=29>So they keep writing lies?</size>
一切都是為了利益嗎……=Is all this just for profit...
嗯……\n這種做法好過分啊……=Yes... That's terrible...
也就是說只要雜誌賣得好，\n他們才不管是不是會毀了別人的生活！=So as long as the magazine sells, \nthey couldn't care less about ruining lives!
普通雜誌倒不會做到這個地步……\n但實際上，大眾就是喜歡看這些吧。=Normal magazines wouldn't stoop this low... But in reality, the public devours these kinds of articles.
現在BAKURO這本雜誌這麼火，\n而{{A}}又是雜誌主編……=Look how popular BAKURO is now, with {{A}} as its editor-in-chief...
證明她的這套方式，\n在口碑和收益上都「成功」了……=It just goes to show her methods are a "success", both in public perception and profitability...
所以，這麼一來……=So, by that logic...
只要那傢伙想，\n就能輕易毀掉一個人，不是嗎？=If she wanted to, she could ruin anyone, right?
{{A}}……什麼意思！？={{A}}... What do you mean!?
你是說，\n她不是為了雜誌銷量而誣陷別人……=You're saying, instead of framing people for the sake of magazine sales...
而是因為「想誣陷別人」，\n才「利用雜誌」的……對嗎？=She is "using the magazine" because she "wanted to frame people"...?
只要{{A}}能找到證據，\n哪怕對方只是犯了點小錯……=Even if it was just a small mistake, as long as {{A}} has the evidence...
她都可以用這種真假參半的文章，\n陷害並毀掉自己不喜歡、或妨礙她的人。=She can spin half-truths into articles to destroy anyone in her way, whether she dislikes them or finds them inconvenient.
原來如此……對方只能眼看報導被瘋傳、\n被全體公眾抨擊，甚至毀掉人生……=I see... Once the article gets out, they face public backlash, their life completely ruined...
然後其他忌憚{{A}}影響力的人，\n就再也不敢反抗她了……！=And from then on, no one who knows her influence would dare cross {{A}}...!
怎麼會這樣……那就是說……=What... That means...
必須立刻讓她改心=<size\=25>We have to change her heart</size>
嗯，沒錯！=Yes, that's right!
{{A}}和那個像秘書的男的……\n一定也是這樣被奪走慾望的吧……！={{A}} and that male secretary... Their desires were definitely stolen the same way...!
唔，本打算學園祭結束前先沉澱幾天，\n看來現在已經迫在眉睫了。=Hm. I'd planned to take a break until the school festival, but we can't afford to wait now.
今天放學後就去{{A}}吧，隊長！=Let's go to {{A}} right after school, Leader!

今天的排練\n能取消嗎=Can we cancel today's rehearsal?
抱歉！\n明天有小考\n不複習就完了！=Sorry! There's a quiz tomorrow, I'm dead if I don't study!
我知道啦\n加油複習吧=I see. Good luck studying.
好的\n那明天再排練吧=Okay, Then we'll rehearse tomorrow.
{{A}}跟{{B}}都回消息了。\n看來他們都同意了呢。={{A}} and {{B}} both replied. \nThey said they agreed.
那我們就出發吧。=Let's go then.

Chapter 4 Metaverse Start
----------
接下來新區域應該會開放。\n先朝著最深處出發吧，隊長。=A new area should unlock ahead. Let's head to the deepest part, Leader.
已確認新增區域。\n導航資訊更新中。=New areas have been confirmed.\nNavigation information is being updated.
大家準備好了嗎？\n朝下一個區域出發吧。=Ok, are you ready? \nLet's head to the next area.
那麼，開始吧。=So, let's get started.
原來如此……這樣聆聽{{A}}的心之聲，\n然後就能找到{{B}}啊。=I see... So this is how you listen to {{A}}' inner voice and pinpoint the {{B}}.
啊，是哦，WIND還是第一次見吧！=Ah, right, it's Wind's first time seeing this!
只要CATTLE知道那傢伙的真名，\n就能找到{{A}}了。=Once Cattle gets their full name, we can track down the {{A}}.
啊，沒什麼。=Ah, it's nothing.
我在想，現在很多人都用筆名或網名吧？\n如果找不出{{A}}的全名……=I was thinking, nowadays, there are a lot of pen names or online aliases, right? If we can't find the {{A}}'s full name...
那我們豈不是一直都找不到{{A}}？=Does that mean we'll never locate their {{A}}?
啊，那倒……也是呢。\n就像{{A}}用「{{B}}」當筆名一樣？=Ah... now that you mention it. It's like how {{A}} uses "{{B}}" as a pen name?
……找到了。\n在這個區域，的確有{{A}}。=...Found it. It seems that {{A}} is definitely in this area.
哦，真的嗎！\n果然{{A}}是{{B}}啊！=Oh, really?! So {{A}} really is a {{B}}!
也沒有像{{B}}和{{A}}那樣的不協調感。\n應該就是{{C}}沒錯了。=And unlike {{B}} and {{A}}, there's no sense of distortion here. This has to be {{C}}.
太好了！這次很順利就找到了呢！=That's great! This time we found it easily!
這也意味著有不少人被那傢伙剝奪了慾望。\n就像{{A}}一樣。=This just proves how many people have had their desires stolen by that bastard. Just like {{A}}.
奪回{{A}}的慾望吧=<size\=22>Let's take back {{A}}'s desires</size>
讓{{A}}改心吧=<size\=23>Let's change {{A}}'s heart</size>
是啊，趁{{A}}的慾望消失之前……\n讓{{A}}改心吧。=Yes, before Ikenami-kun's desires disappear completely... Let's change {{A}}'s heart.

----------
Chapter 4 Palace Start
----------
這是哪裡？這次的{{A}}在森林裡嗎？=Where is this? Is the {{A}} in a forest this time?
有點嚇人呢……\n看起來像那種女巫居住的森林……=It's a bit creepy... This looks like a forest where witches live...
哈，大魔女{{A}}？\n一點都不好笑。=Huh, The Great Witch {{A}}? \nThat's not funny.
{{A}}的氣息還有段距離。\n先向森林深處前進吧。=The {{A}}'s presence is very far. Let's head deeper into the forest.
說是女巫森林可能也沒錯。\n你們看那邊。=Maybe it's not wrong to call this the witch's forest. Look.
那是什麼！？好巨大的建築！=What is that!? There's a huge building!
大樓……？=Building...?
塔……？=Tower...?

Choice 1
比起大樓……從裝飾上看更像一座塔呢。\n看起來相當高。=Rather than a building... the exterior looks more like a tower. It seems very tall.
Choice 2
是啊，看起來相當高。\n一座矗立在森林中的塔……？=Yes, it seems very tall. A tower standing in the middle of the forest...?

她應該認為自己的城堡是一座「塔」吧。\n儘管很難推測這究竟出於何種思想……=She must see her castle a "tower". \nThough it's hard to image why...
{{A}}的氣息就在那座塔的方向。\n而且，位置相當高。=The presence of the {{A}} is is coming from that tower. And it's located pretty high up.
原來如此，那就是在塔上吧。\n有意思。=I see, that must be at the top. \nInteresting.
{{A}}一定也在裡面。\n前進的時候保持警惕吧。={{A}} is definitely in there too. Let's stay alert as we move forward.

{{A}}……\n靠近了一看，有點壯觀啊……={{A}}...\nIt's amazing to see it up close...
又誇張又惡俗……\n我的眼都要被閃瞎了。=Gaudy and tacky... it's practically blinding.
這也不是出版社的樣子吧……\n但挺符合對她本人的印象的。=Doesn't look like a publishing house either... \nbut it fits her image perfectly.
好了，我們趕緊進去吧……=Alright, let's hurry inside...
那裡看起來像是入口，\n但聚集了很多陰影啊。=That looks like the entrance, \nbut Shadows are gathering there.
看起來他們好像吵起來了。\n我們先躲起來看看情況。=Seems like they're arguing. \nLet's hide and observe for now.
雄性工蟻陰影=Male Worker Ant Shadow
拜託了！這篇報導如果今天還過不了，\n我就又得住公司了！=Please! If this article doesn't get approved today, I'll have to sleep at the office again!
雌性工蟻陰影=Female Worker Ant Shadow
請讓我見見{{A}}吧～！=Please let me see {{A}}～!
警衛螞蟻陰影=Guardian Ant Shadow
{{A}}可是很忙的！\n沒時間管你們這些平民的事情！={{A}} is busy! She has no time for commoners like you!
態度{{A}}的螞蟻陰影=Prideful Ant Shadow
如果想見到{{A}}的話，\n那就變成帥哥後再來吧！=If you want an audience with her, \ncome back when you're handsome!
{{B}}～抱歉我不是帥哥！\n但沒有{{A}}，工作就推不下去啦！={{B}}～ Sorry I'm not handsome! But without {{A}}, I can't continue my work!
怎樣才能成為，\n被{{A}}記住的員工呢……？=What does it take to become an employee {{A}} actually remembers...
……他們在幹什麼啊。=...What are they doing.
不清楚……反正那些像螞蟻的陰影，\n好像把入口都給堵住了。=Not sure... But the entrance is blocked by those ant-like Shadows.
要不要直接打進去？=Should we just bust in?
不想打草驚蛇=<size\=30>Don't want to alert them</size>
打倒他們吧=Let's beat them

Choice 1
唔，吾等可是怪盜。\n為了安全偷到{{A}}，還是別太顯眼為好。=Hm, we are Phantom Thieves after all. Best not be too conspicuous in order to steal the {{A}} safely.
沒錯。如果引起騷動的話，\n容易被{{A}}察覺到。=Yes, if we make a scene here, {{A}} might notice.
而且也還不明白{{A}}內部的構造，\n所以還是儘量秘密潛入吧。=We don't know the {{A}}'s interior structure, let's infiltrate as stealthily as possible.

Choice 2
等等，在這裡引起騷動的話，\n很可能被{{A}}察覺的。=Wait, if we make a scene here, {{A}} might notice.
而且吾等可是怪盜。\n為了安全偷到{{A}}，還是別太顯眼為好。=We are Phantom Thieves after all. Best not be too conspicuous in order to steal the {{A}} safely.
加上我們還不明白{{A}}的內部構造，\n所以還是儘量秘密潛入吧。=And we don't know the {{A}}'s interior structure, let's infiltrate as stealthily as possible.

啊，快看快看！那邊有條路！=Ah, look! There's a road over there!
也許那邊有入口？=<size\=26>Maybe there's an entrance?</size>
過去看看吧=Let's take a look

能從裡面感受到挺多動靜。\n是陰影嗎……也可能是認知存在。=I sense multiple presences coming from within. They could be Shadows... or cognitive beings.
謹慎地前進吧=<size\=28>Let's proceed with caution</size>
沒錯，光害怕也不是辦法。\n總之先進去看看吧！=Yes, it's not good to be scared. \nLet's go inside anyway!

沒想到，外面這麼誇張，\n結果裡面這麼陰暗啊……=Compared to the flashy exterior, \nthe inside is rather dim...
對啊。破破爛爛的，感覺像個洞窟……=Yeah. It's all run-down, feels like a cave...
而且還有很多陰影。\n不過，它們好像並不在乎我們。=And it's full of Shadows. \nBut they don't seem to mind us.
他們拿著資料到處晃……\n難道是在工作嗎……？=They're shuffling around with documents... \nAre they working?
我得快點寫完這篇報導，\n然後獻給{{A}}才行！=I have to finish this article fast... \nthen present it to {{A}}!
為了{{A}}，我要通宵加班！\n然後要成為她中意的人！=For {{A}}, I will work overtime! Then I will become her favorite!
嗯……「為了{{A}}而工作的工蟻」，\n是這種認知存在吧？=Hmm... so these cognitive beings are "worker ants toiling for {{A}}"?
還說什麼「寫完報導」……\n不會是她{{A}}的同事或下屬吧？=And they mentioned "finishing an article"... Could it be they are her colleague or subordinate from {{A}}?
就是說她把其他員工都當成工蟻？\n這，{{A}}……=So she treats all her employees like worker ants? That's...
畢竟在現實世界，\n她也把身邊那個男的叫做「狗」呢。=Even in the real world, \nshe called that man a "dog".
真是把她的性格暴露得淋漓盡致……\n想必她就是這裡的蟻后了吧？=Her true personality has comes to light... \nGuess she's the queen ant here, huh?
{{A}}的氣息還很遠，\n吾等一邊警戒這些陰影一邊前進吧。=The {{A}}'s presence is still distant. Let's move forward while being cautious of Shadows.

Palace 5 Exploration Part 1
----------
有幅可疑的畫呢。\n這是……{{A}}的肖像畫嗎？=There's a suspicious painting here.\nIs this... a portrait of {{A}}?
唔啊……真的假的啊。\n那傢伙是有多自戀啊……=Huh... seriously? \nJust how full of herself is she...
上面寫著『向女王獻上敬意』……\n是什麼意思呢？=It says "Pay tribute to the Queen"... \nWhat does it mean?
敬意……？\n嗯......對著這張畫鞠躬什麼的？=Tribute...? \nHmm... Do we have to bow or something?
鞠躬了也沒什麼反應呢……\n其他的表達敬意的方式……會是語言嗎？=There's no response even after bowing... Is there any other way to pay tribute... maybe words?
是要稱讚{{A}}的意思嗎？\n我可說不出口！=We have to praise {{A}}?\nNo way I'm saying that!
女王大人最棒了！=<size\=30>Her Majesty is the best!</size>
把我的心獻給女王大人=<size\=26>I dedicate my heart to Her Majesty</size>
唔啊！？\n這、這是怎麼回事……！？=Hmm!?\nWh-What's going on...!?
{{A}}！？　變成螞蟻了！？\n這樣，不會有事吧……？={{A}}! We're ants!?\nI-is this fine...?
原來如此……看來只要向\n女王的肖像畫表忠誠，就能變成螞蟻的樣子。=I see... It seems that by showing loyalty to the portrait, we can turn into ants.
這樣說不定就可以通過更多的地方了。\n一邊探索一邊調查吧。=Maybe we can pass through more places like this. Let's keep exploring.

對著{{A}}的肖像畫\n說些什麼吧……=Let's say something to {{A}}'s portrait...
把心獻給女王大人！=For Her Majesty!
我才不要當螞蟻呢！=<size\=29>I don't want to be an ant!</size>
什麼都沒有發生……=Nothing happened...
身體發生變化了……！=Our bodies changed...!
WONDER，門開了！=Wonder, the door opened!

快看，這個牆壁上有個洞。\n不過那麼小，好像不太能通過……=Look, there's a hole in this wall. But it's so small, we can't really pass...
不過，如果變成螞蟻是不是就能通過了？=However, we can pass if we turn into ants?
值得一試。\n變成螞蟻後再來看看吧。=It's worth a try. Let's try again after turning into ants.
WONDER，這個樣子怎麼想都進不去吧！=Wonder, there's no way you can enter like this!

嗯？　這個，好像是這裡的地圖吧？=This is the map of this place, right?
嗯……應該是的。路線似乎有些複雜。\n仔細看看吧。=Yes... The route seems a bit complicated. Let's take a closer look.

你是誰？\n這裡容不得『外人』通過。=Who are you?\nNo "outsiders" are allowed.
哦，辛苦了。過去吧。=Oh, hard work. Go ahead.
WONDER，這個太重了……\n想想其他辦法吧。=Wonder, this is too heavy... \nLet's think of something else.

嗯……這扇門打不開呢。\n附近好像也沒有操作裝置……=Hmm... this door can't be opened. Are there's no operating device nearby.
別急，CLOSER。\n你看那是什麼。=Wait, Closer.\nLook what's there.
嗯？\n有點像是……放什麼東西的基座？=Huh? Kinda like a basel for... something?
旁邊還有一顆結晶。\n大小與基座正好一致。=There is a crystal next to it. The size is exactly the same as the base.
啊，我明白了！\n把結晶放在基座上就行了吧！=Ah, I see! Just put the crystal on the base, right?
可惡……什麼鬼東西，\n也太重了吧！！=Damn... what the hell, it's too heavy!!
已經很努力了……卻紋絲不動啊！\n到底該怎麼辦呀這個～！？=I tried so hard... but nothing happened! What should we do?
……WONDER，是不是可以\n用一下那個變身裝置？=...Wonder, how about using that transformation device?
你是指那幅畫？=You mean the painting?
「向女王獻上敬意」？="Pay tribute to the Queen"?
嗯。利用那幅肖像畫變成螞蟻，\n也許就能搬動這個結晶了。=Yes. By using that portrait to turn into ants, maybe we can move this crystal.
這麼一說……聽說螞蟻可以舉起\n大於自身體重數百倍的物體呢。=Come to think of it... ants can lift hundreds of times their own weight.
嗯……值得一試。附近看看\n能不能找到那副肖像畫吧，WONDER。=Yes... it's worth a try. Look around to see if you can find that portrait, Wonder.

門開了！　而且你們注意到了嗎？\n那個吊燈的顏色，和結晶是一致的。=It's open! And did you notice? The chandelier is the same color as the crystal.
今後要是遇到類似的機關，\n也試著注意一下顏色吧，WONDER。=Try to pay attention to the color if we come across similar mechanisms in the future, Wonder.

啊！大家當心！\n前面很危險！=Ah! Look out!\nIt's dangerous!
嗯……斷崖對面有個結晶。\n不過，要怎麼過去呢……=Hmm... There is a crystal opposite the cliff. \nBut how to get there...
看，那些結晶之間……\n像是透過某種能量連接在一起。=Look, those crystals... seem to be connected together by some energy.
類似的結晶這邊也有……\n這邊的好像沒有射出能量呢。=There are similar crystals here as well... But the ones here don't emit any energy.
隊長，這裡有個之前見過的機關。\n要不試試看？=Leader, we've seen this mechanism before, want to try it?
啊！　能量一樣的東西\n也連到這邊來了！=Ah! The energy is now connected here!
嗯……莫非這些是……=Hmm... Could it be these are...
嗯，就好像道路一樣呢。=Yes, it's like the road.
{{A}}？是可以在上面走的意思嗎？={{A}}? Does this mean we can walk on it?
不過現在的我們是螞蟻，說不定真可以！\n試試吧！=But now we're ants, maybe it is possible! Let's try it!

這樣就好了！小菜一碟！=That's it! Piece of cake!
嗯……但可能還會有更複雜的機關。\n現在高興還太早了哦。=Hmm... but there may be more complicated mechanisms. It's too early to celebrate.
不變成螞蟻是過不去的……=Can't cross without becoming an ant...
WONDER，結晶連接起來了！=Wonder, the crystals are connected!

門後可能會有敵人在迎接吾等。\nWONDER，準備好了嗎？=There may be enemies waiting behind this door.\nWonder, are you ready?

{{A}}？這前面沒路了？={{A}}? Maybe this is a dead end?
看上去也沒有樓梯呢。\n如果不能從這裡去往上層的話……=There doesn't seem to be any stairs. \nIf we can't go upstairs from here...
去看看裡面那堵牆？\n雖然有好多陰影圍在那裡……=Check out that wall? Although there are many shadows surrounding it...
反正現在也別無他法了，\n就試著去跟它們搭搭話吧。=Maybe we should try talking to them, \nsince we're at a dead end anyway.
失意的螞蟻陰影=Disappointed Ant Shadow
{{B}}～{{A}}今天還是沒找我！\n明明我一直通宵工作……！={{B}}～ {{A}} still didn't find me! I've been working all night...!
沮喪的螞蟻陰影=Frustrated Ant Shadow
就因為我們不是帥哥嗎……！=Is it because I'm not handsome...!
沒找你？=Didn't find you?
帥哥？=Handsome?
你好阿=Hello
你你、你們誰啊？是新來的嗎？=W-Who are you? Are you new?
完蛋，這群人長的還挺帥的啊！\n如果變成我們的同事……=Oh no, these people look handsome! \nIf they become our colleague...
就會奪走{{A}}的寵愛！\n必須現在毀掉他們！！=They will take away {{A}}'s favor! They must be destroyed now!!
把帥哥幼苗扼殺在搖籃裡！=Kill the handome ones in their cradle!
它們在說啥啊……=What are talking about...
{{A}}……是不是可以理解為，\n他們只會攻擊WONDER和SOY？={{A}}... Does this mean they will only attack Wonder and Soy?
那這些陰影就交給你們帥哥二人組啦！=Then I'll leave these Shadows to you handsome duo!
喂，開什麼玩笑啊，\nWIND、CLOSER！=Hey, are you kidding me? \nWind, Closer!
……CLOSER啊，\n為什麼吾不在帥哥列表裡……！=Handsome duo? ...Closer, why am I not on the list...!
那個，\n誰知道CATTLE你是公是母……？=Well, who knows if Cattle's a boy or a girl...?
算了，他們來了！小心應對！=Never mind, here they come! Be careful!

嗯……沒有暗門。\n真的是個死路啊。=Hmm... There is no secret door. \nIt's really a dead end.
難道只有從剛才的入口進去，\n才能到達塔頂嗎？=Can we only reach the top of the tower through that entrance?
那我們先回去看看？\n說不定那些陰影已經離開了呢！=Should we head back and check? Maybe those Shadows have already left!
嗯，判斷和指揮就交給隊長吧。=Right, we'll leave the decisions to the leader.

不行，完全沒有離開的意思……=No good, they haven't budged at all...
乾脆還是把陰影都打倒吧，\n然後直接進去！=Let's just defeat the Shadows and charge in!
……不行。\n我們暫時返回現實世界吧。=...No. We should retreat to the real world for now.
我們對{{A}}所知太少，\n就算強行進入，恐怕也很難有什麼進展。=We know too little about {{A}}. Even if we force our way in, we'd likely make no progress.
……的確。\n目前吾等只知道她是個缺德記者而已。=...True. All we know is that she's an unethical journalist.
而且就算這一點，\n也是從網路報導推測出來的。=And even that's just speculation from online articles.
但除了從網路上查還能怎麼辦呢？\n我們跟她又完全不認識。=But what else can we do besides searching online? We don't know her at all.
畢竟也就只見過兩次面……=After all, we've only met twice...
返回現實世界再考慮吧=Let's plan in the real world
一起想想調查方法吧=<size\=30>Let's brainstorm together</size>
唔，能找到{{A}}就已經是不小的收穫了。\n今天就先回去吧，隊長。=Well, finding the {{A}} is already a great achievement. Let's go back today, Leader.

回來了……\n那接下來我們該怎麼調查{{A}}呢？=We're back... So how should we investigate {{A}}?
她是在叫{{A}}的地方工作吧？\n我又不認識什麼出版社的人……=She works at {{A}}, right? \nBut I don't know anyone in publishing...
吾等和{{B}}的唯一交集……\n也就是{{A}}了。=Our only connection to {{B}}... is {{A}}.
不好吧，他可是受害者本人哦？\n哪會想跟我們聊{{A}}的事啊。=No good, he's the victim himself. Why would he want to talk to us about {{A}}.
不好吧，他可是受害者本人哦！\n哪會想跟我們聊{{A}}的事啊。=No good, he's the victim himself! Why would he want to talk to us about {{A}}.
一碼歸一碼。吾認為，\n打聽一下他之前遭受的不公也無妨。=Call a spade a spade. I think it would be ok to at least ask him about the injustice he suffered.
到時候順口問一下吧=Bring it up casually
叫他去家庭餐廳？=Invite him to a diner?

Choice 1
可以。不過這對{{A}}來說，\n可能是很敏感的話題……=True. But this might be a sensitive topic for Ikenami-kun...
必須要注意說話方式。=We have to be careful with our approach.
Choice 2
唔，刻意叫他出來有點不太自然……\n{{A}}也會有所警惕吧。=Hmm, inviting him directly would seem suspicious... It'd put Ikenami-kun on guard.
在更自然的情況下打聽打聽呢……=Maybe we could ask casually...
比如在排練休息的時候，\n假裝不經意地問問吧。=Like asking casually during a rehearsal break.
還要排練啊……說實話，\n我明天還想集中精力攻略{{A}}呢。=More rehearsals...? Honestly, I wanted to focus on the {{A}} tomorrow.
不，我們還是繼續排練舞臺劇吧。=No, we should continue with the play rehearsals.
畢竟不知道那個幕後黑手……\n會躲在哪裡悄悄觀察我們呢。=Who knows where that mastermind might be watching us from?
在這種時候缺席學校活動，\n會顯得十分惹眼吧。=Skipping school events now would make us stand out too much.
啊，對哦……！\n{{A}}當時也是來我們學校打探{{B}}的！=Oh right...! {{A}} came snooping around our school for the {{B}}!
確實，要是不小心被當做可疑目標，\n可就兩頭空了啊。=Exactly. If we get flagged as suspects, we'll lose on both fronts.
當然無論是調查{{A}}，\n還是攻略{{B}}都需要繼續進行……=Of course, we'll keep investigating {{A}} and infiltrating the {{B}}...
但也得做出學園祭前正常學生的樣子，\n好好準備活動才行呢。=But we should act like normal students preparing for the festival.
r:"^唔，沒錯。吾也跟(.*)說過，\n你們的本職是學生。$"="Indeed. As I told $1, you are students at heart."
而且無論是努力學習還是享受活動……\n都是為了讓生存慾望更活躍。=Besides, whether it's studying hard or enjoying activities... it's all about making the desire to live more vibrant.
讓生存的慾望更活躍嗎……=Making the desire to live more vibrant...
要我刻苦學習，\n可能反倒會降低慾望呢……=Forcing me to study hard might actually kill my desire instead...
沒錯！+1！=Right! Plus one!

----------
3rd Rehearsal
----------
好，今天我們過一遍第2幕吧。\n先從{{B}}們的母親——{{A}}開始。=Okay, let's go through act 2 today. Starting with the protagonist's mother, {{A}}.
好！就給大家看看……\n我昨天熬夜練習的成果……！=Alright! Let me show you all... The results of my late-night practice..!
「大家～飯做好了喲～」="Everyone～ Dinner's ready～!"
{{A}}，我今天一句臺詞都沒說錯！={{A}}, I didn't mess up a single line today!
唔，不愧是{{A}}……\n我今天又卡詞了……=Hm, as expected from {{A}}...\nI stumbled over my words again...
沒事，大家都進步很快。特別是{{A}}，\n……噗，母親的演技，不得不服。=It's fine. Everyone's improving fast. Especially {{A}}... Pfft, your acting as the mother is unreal.
真的！？耶……沒白練！=For real!? Then... all that practice paid off!
這人還當真了……=...They actually bought it.
大家個性都很突出，演得也很精彩。\n我忍不住畫了好多素描。=Everyone's personalities were so vivid, and the acting was brilliant. I couldn't stop sketching!
能為漫畫帶來靈感？=Inspired your manga?
給我看看素描=Show me the sketches

Choice 1
是的，很多靈感。\n分鏡應該也會畫得很順利。=Yes, so much inspiration. The storyboarding should go smoothly too.
Choice 2
可以啊。\n雖然可能沒什麼意思就是。=That's fine. Though it might not be very interesting.
抱歉事出突然，但明天我需要請個假。=Sorry for the sudden notice, but I'll need to take tomorrow off.
哎呀，是嗎？=Oh, really?
嗯。明天有個約好的雜誌採訪。=Yes. I have a scheduled magazine interview tomorrow.
一本叫「漫畫筆記」的漫畫資訊雜誌，\n要做{{A}}的特輯……=It's for a manga info magazine called "Comic Note", and they're doing a feature on {{A}}...
應該也要刊載對我的採訪內容。=They'll probably include my interview too.
哦哦～採訪！\n不愧是人氣漫畫家啊！=Ooh～ An interview! As expected of a popular manga artist!
對了，我看過新聞呢，\n{{A}}的累計銷量突破500萬冊了。=Yes, I saw the news. {{A}} has sold over 5 million copies in total.
……是啊，托大家的福。=...Yes, thanks to everyone's support.
500萬！？=5 million?!
好強……！也就是說，我想想啊，\n1本是600日元左右？所以銷售額是……=That's insane! Wait, let me think. If one volume is around 600 yen, then the total sales would be...
我平時不怎麼關注稿費這塊。\n版稅也都是讓父母幫我管理。=I don't really pay attention to earnings. My parents handle all the royalties for me.
我只要……能畫漫畫就好。\n在「漫畫筆記」的採訪中我也會這麼說。=I just... want to keep drawing manga. That's what I'll say in the "Comic Note" interview too.
「漫畫筆記」……\n是不是{{A}}的雜誌？="Comic Note"...\nIsn't that from {{A}}?
啊，是的。\n{{A}}竟然知道這麼小眾的雜誌啊。=Ah, yes. I'm surprised you know such a niche magazine, {{A}}.
因為我正好在調查……=Well, I've been looking into...
……調查？=...Looking into?
啊，沒有。沒什麼。=Ah, nothing. Never mind.
啊，{{B}}就是{{A}}在的那家！=Ah, {{B}} is where {{A}} works, right?!
笨蛋！=Idiot!
那個！啊～那個……\n我是說……津、金沙芋泥三明治！好想吃！=Uh! Ah～ Umm... I mean... T-Tsuna... Tuna sandwich! Man, I'm starvin'!
的、的確肚子餓了=I-I'm starving too
我想吃雞蛋三明治=<size\=30>I want an egg sandwich</size>
金沙金沙金沙～=Tuna tuna tuna～
{{A}}，完全沒起到轉移話題的效果啊……={{A}}, you're not fooling anyone...
你們不會是……\n在調查{{A}}吧？=You guys aren't... looking into {{A}}, are you?
{{B}}！\n就是之前纏著{{A}}的那個女性吧。={{B}}! It's the woman who was pestering {{A}} before.
{{A}}……\n這下全露餡了呢……={{A}}... Guess the cat's out of the bag now...
大家為什麼要特意調查她呢……？=Why would you all go out of your way to look into her...?
啊，不，也不算是調查啦。\n那個人在網上還挺有名的呢。=Oh, no, it's not really investigating. She's just well-known online.
我當時覺得好像在哪兒見過她，\n就順手搜了一下罷了。=I thought I'd seen her somewhere before, \nso I did a quick search. That's all.
我當時覺得好像在哪裡見過她，\n就順手搜了一下罷了。=I thought I'd seen her somewhere before, \nso I did a quick search. That's all.
哎，她的確是個紅人啦……=Well, she is pretty notorious...
可、可不是嘛！{{A}}似乎也很煩她，\n所以我們好奇她是個什麼來頭……=Y-Yeah! And since {{A}} seemed so annoyed by her, we just got curious about what her deal was...
那個……如果大家是因為擔心我，\n所以調查那個人的話，還是算了吧。=Hey... if you're looking into her because you're worried about me, just stop.
最好別跟她扯上關係。=It's better not to get involved with her.
啊不……是說她這人個性很強。\n要是隨便接近她，反倒會弄得自己不愉快。=I mean... she's just really intense. You'll only end up upsetting yourselves if you got involved.
我嘛因為工作關係已經習慣了……\n俗話說，多一事不如少一事嘛？=I'm used to this kind of thing from work... You know what they say, "let sleeping dogs lie"?
你沒事嗎？=Are you okay?
我們擔心你=<size\=28>We are worried about you</size>
……沒事的，不必擔心我。=...I'm fine, don't worry about me.
來，我們繼續排練吧。\n接下來從{{A}}和我的戲開始！=Alright, let's resume practice. We'll start from the scene between {{A}} and me.
{{C}}，剛才{{A}}說的……\n她明天要去{{B}}的事。={{C}}, about what {{A}} just said... her visit to {{B}} tomorrow...
怎麼了？=What's wrong?
也許是潛入的好機會=A chance to infiltrate

Choice 1
你看看能不能一起去？\n比如說參觀之類的……=See if you can go with her? Could make up an excuse like going on a tour...
Choice 2
嗯，我也這麼想。=Yes, I was thinking the same thing.
唔，的確。如果錯過了這次機會，\n想再進入{{A}}內部可就難了。=True. If we miss this opportunity, getting inside {{A}}'s offices will be nearly impossible.
不過，要怎麼開口才好？=But how should we ask?
只能直說了吧？\n就說「我想參觀，能不能帶我去」。=Just be direct? Like "I'd like to visit, mind if I tag along".
或者說，對出版社感興趣什麼的……\n想見識一下漫畫採訪是什麼樣的……？=Or maybe say you're interested in publishing... want to see how manga interviews work...?
你們想看採訪嗎？=Do you want to watch the interview?
哇！？=Wah!?
抱歉。大家剛才聊天時一直在看我，\n所以我比較在意……=Sorry. I noticed everyone kept looking at me while talking, so I was curious...
啊，抱、抱歉。\n打擾到你畫畫了吧……=Ah, s-sorry. We interrupted your sketching...
沒關係的。所以……\n你們是想跟我一起去明天的採訪嗎？=It's fine. So... you said you wanted to come along to my interview tomorrow?
想看看出版社裡面……=Wanted to see inside...
你是不是需要保鏢……=Do you need bodyguard

Choice 1
這樣啊，是單純感興趣吧。=Oh, it's just simple curiosity.
……想看看出版社、電視臺的後臺，\n好奇內部是什麼樣子之類。我懂的。=...Wanting to see behind the scenes at a publisher or TV station. I get it.
Choice 2
……保鏢？保護我嗎？=...Bodyguard? To protect me?
對、對啊！天知道出版社裡會出什麼事？\n所以得來個保鏢……=Y-Yeah! Who knows what could happen at a publisher? Better safe than sorry...
能發生什麼呢……我只是去接受採訪而已，\n配保鏢實在是沒必要……=What exactly would happen... It's just an interview, bodyguard seem excessive...
{{A}}，其實我們只是在聊，\n想參觀一下出版社裡面啦。={{A}}, actually, we were just talking about touring the offices.

那個……可以嗎？\n不會打擾到你工作的……=Um... would that be okay? We wouldn't want to disrupt your work...
我沒意見哦。=I don't mind.
{{A}}，可是……！={{A}}, but...!
{{A}}？真的嗎？={{A}}? Really?
我們這些非工作人員去那裡，\n不知道會不會很冒昧……=But would it be rude for outsiders like us to just show up...?
這個我會想辦法的。=I'll do something about that.
不過當然……\n我要先徵得負責編輯的同意才行。=Well, of course... if I get permission from the person in charge.
哦……！沒問題，完全沒問題！\n那就拜託你了，{{A}}！=Oh...! That's totally okay! Please, {{A}}!
謝謝……好開心啊！=<size\=28>Thanks... I'm so excited!</size>
不愧是{{A}}啊……！=<size\=28>As expected from {{A}}...!</size>
你、你們那麼想參觀啊……=You... you all really want to visit that badly...
我知道了。\n那我打個電話確認一下。=Alright then. Let me make a quick call to confirm.
好，今天就到這裡吧。\n那麼，明天見！=Ok, then that's it for today. See you tomorrow!
啊～抱歉，{{A}}！\n我們明天……臨時有事情！=Ah～ Sorry, {{A}}! We... suddenly have something to do tomorrow!
明天可不可以不排練了？=Can we cancel rehearsal tomorrow?
怎麼了，又要考試嗎？\n好。那明天就休息一天。=What is it this time, more tests? \nGot it. We'll take tomorrow off.
{{A}}你要自己好好練，別再卡詞啦。\n拜拜！={{A}}, practice your lines alone, no more stumbling. Later!
那個，關於剛才的事……=About what we discussed earlier...
責任編輯同意了。\n不過，只允許1個人同行……=The editor gave permission. But only one person can come along...
1個人？=One person?
是的，他說一下子出現4個無關人員的話，\n會給採訪造成不便……=Yes, he said four unexpected visitors would disrupt the interview...
大家覺得怎麼樣呢？=What do you all think?
1個人也行=One is fine
怎麼辦……=What to do...

Choice 1
……這樣也行？\n我還以為你們想一起去……=...Is this okay? I thought you all wanted to go together...
啊，當然想啦，不過……\n本就是冒昧的請求，只去1個已經很好啦。=Ah, of course we do, but... it's our sudden request, getting one person to go is already great.
那，{{A}}……\n我們就決定一下誰去吧？怎麼說？=So, uh... How should we decide who goes?
嗯，要說我們這群人的代表……=Hmm, if we're choosing a representative...
Choice 2
抱歉……\n大家肯定還是想一起去參觀吧。=Sorry... I know everyone wanted to visit.
啊，不過畢竟是我們冒昧的請求，\n能去1個人就已經很好啦。=Ah, it's our sudden request, getting one person to go is already great.
沒錯沒錯，{{A}}不用道歉啦。\n應該是我們謝謝你幫忙才對！=Exactly, don't apologize, {{A}}! We should be thanking you for helping!
那，我們決定一下到底誰去吧。\n如果選個代表的話，那肯定是……=Alright, let's decide who's going. If we're choosing a representative, obviously...
感受到了來自大家的熱烈視線……=Felt everyone's enthusiastic gazes...
那我去吧……=Then I'll go...
我不想去……=I don't want to go...
交給我就完事了=Just leave it to me

Choice 1
謝謝。\n果然還得是你呢。=Thanks. I knew I could count on you.
那就拜託啦，我們的隊長！=Then please, our Leader!
之後再告訴我們情況哦。=Please give us all the details afterward.
Choice 2
{{A}}！怎麼那麼沒底氣……！？={{A}}! Why are you so unconfident...!?
真是太陽從西邊出來了……=Hell must've frozen over...
我們應付不來啦！\n拜託你了，隊長！=We'd be terrible at this! Please, Leader!
Choice 3
不愧是你！\n之後再告訴我們情況哦。=As expected from you! Please give us all the details afterward.
r:"^那就決定了……\n(.*){{A}}跟我一起去。$"="Then it's decided...\n$1-senpai will come with me."
對了，明天請穿「常服」來。\n理由的話……到時候就知道了。=Oh, and wear "casual clothes" tomorrow. You'll... understand why when the time comes.
稍後我會發你集合時間什麼的。\n明天還{{A}}。=I'll message you the meeting time and details. Looking forward to working with you tomorrow.

Aran Interview

{{A}}編輯={{A}} Editor
{{A}}，感謝您今天抽出時間接受採訪。\n還{{B}}。={{A}}, thank you for taking the time to be interviewed today. Nice to meet you.
責編御手洗=Editor Mitarashi
我是{{A}}的責編御手洗。\n{{B}}。=I'm Mitarashi, {{A}}'s editor. {{B}}.
我是{{A}}。{{B}}。=I am {{A}}. {{B}}.
然後這位是……=And this is...
嗯，聽說了。是{{A}}的朋友，\n{{B}}新聞部的部長吧。=Ah, I've heard. You're {{A}}'s friend, the president of the newspaper club at {{B}}.
新聞部！？=Newspaper club!?

Choice 1
……{{A}}？\n你不是想把這次採訪登在學校報紙上嗎？=...{{A}}? Didn't you want to publish this interview in the school newspaper?
我是聽{{A}}這麼說的。=That's what {{A}} told me.
嗯，沒錯。\n你別緊張啊，「部長」。=Yes, that's right. Don't be so nervous, "president".

Choice 2
你怎麼了？「部長」。\n是緊張了嗎？=What's wrong, "president"? Are you nervous?
我聽{{A}}說了哦，\n你想把這次採訪刊載到學校報紙上吧。=I heard from {{A}} that you wanted to publish this interview in the school newspaper.
校報嗎，真好啊～\n讓我回憶起了學生時代呢。=A school newspaper, that's nice～ Brings back memories of my student days.

原來如此，{{A}}說你是{{B}}新聞部的，\n他們才同意的吧……=I see, They only agreed to this because {{A}} said you were from {{B}}'s newspaper club...
不過請注意，\n不要劇透今天採訪的內容哦。=However, please be careful not to spoil today's interview contents.
哎呀，今天真是受益匪淺。\n感謝您的配合，{{A}}。=Well, today was truly enlightening. Thank you very much for your time, {{A}}.
客氣了，我才應該道謝。=You're welcome. I should be the one thanking you.
那麼，新聞部的小夥子？\n感覺能寫出報導來嗎？=So, the young man from the newspaper club? Think you can write the article?
報導？=Article?
我有事想問……=<size\=29>I have something to ask...</size>

Choice 1
{{A}}，你沒事吧？\n還在緊張嗎？={{A}}, you okay? Still nervous?
如果你有什麼問題就儘管問哦。=If you have questions, just ask!
Choice 2
啊，是要問問題嗎？歡迎歡迎。=Oh, you want to ask something? Go ahead!
r:"^好，機會來了，(.*)！\n快問問(.*)的事！$"="Alright, this is your chance, $1! Ask about $2!"
週刊BAKURO的主編……=<size\=20>Editor-in-chief of Weekly BAKURO...</size>

Choice 1
{{B}}，週刊BAKURO的主編？\n……是指{{A}}？={{B}}? The editor-in-chief of Weekly BAKURO? ...You mean {{A}}?
Choice 2
嗯？你說的{{A}}是……\n指我們BAKURO編輯部的嗎？=Hm? The {{A}} you're talking about... Is she from our BAKURO editorial?

{{A}}，為什麼偏偏問起她？\n不會是……投訴什麼的吧？={{A}}, why are you asking about her? Don't tell me... you're filing a complaint?
r:"^不好，問得太直接了！\n對方似乎有戒心了，(.*)！$"="No, that's too straightforward! They're getting defensive, $1!"
我只是覺得她好漂亮……=I just think she's pretty...
我對醜聞雜誌感興趣……=<size\=25>I'm interested in scandal magazines...</size>

Choice 1
{{A}}～你這也太突然了……\n不過也難怪，畢竟她也算是公眾人物。={{A}}, that's kinda sudden... But I get it, she is a public figure.
Choice 2
{{B}}？也就是說，你崇拜{{A}}？\n這可真是……={{B}}? So you admire {{A}}? That's...
不過，畢竟那個人在網路上確實很有名……=Though, she is pretty famous online..
抱歉啊，關於她我沒什麼好說的。\n如果是我們編輯部的事，我倒可以多說點。=Sorry, I don't have much to say about her. But if it's about our editorial team, I can share more.
看樣子話題進行不下去了……\n怎麼辦才好呢……=Seems like the conversation's hitting a dead end... What to do...
那個……\n其實我們最近見到了那位{{A}}……=Um... actually, we met {{A}} recently...
{{A}}？哇，這是畫的她嗎！？\n畫得好棒！太像了！={{A}}? Wow, is this a drawing of her?! It's amazing! So accurate!
{{C}}？為什麼{{A}}會畫{{B}}？={{C}}? Why would {{A}} draw {{B}}?
最近那個……她來過學校呢。\n大概是對{{A}}有採訪吧……=Well... she recently visited our school. Probably to interview {{A}}...
啊～的確，\n{{A}}跟{{B}}在同一所學校呢。=Ahh～ Right, {{A}} and {{B}} goes to the same school.
然後……那個，她太有存在感了，\n我情不自禁就畫了下來……=And... well, she's so striking, I couldn't help but sketch her...
我經常跟部長提起，\n想把她當做漫畫原型呢……=I keep telling the president I want use her as a manga reference...
啊～那與其說是這位小夥子自己想問，\n其實是替{{A}}問的啊？=Ahh～ So it's not that the young man wanted to ask himself, he was actually asking for {{A}}'s sake, right?
{{A}}，原來如此。\n那個人確實很適合變成漫畫角色呢！={{A}}, I see. That person would actually make a great manga character!
是吧……那，如果您知道些什麼，\n請務必告訴我們……=Right? So... if you know anything about her, please tell us...
對吧，部長？=Right, president?
比如她在社內的軼事……=Like her anecdotes in work...
比如她的個人性格……=Like her personality...
嗯……這個就有點為難我啦……\n你看，我們都有對個人資訊的規定……=Hmm... this is a bit tough for me... You see, we have rules about personal information...
她很有魄力吧=She's very assertive?
她有點可怕吧=She's kind of scary?

Choice 1
啊～那只是對外啦，對外。\n要是在公司裡嘛……哎呀。=Ah～ That's on the outside. Inside the company? Well... umm.
Choice 2
那可不止「有點」哦～！\n先不說對外，在公司裡可是……哎呀。=Not just "kind of"～！Outside the company, sure, but inside... umm.
在公司裡？是什麼樣子的呀？\n我很感興趣……=Inside the company? What's she like? I'm really curious...
不行不行，不能再說下去啦！\n她可是銷冠雜誌的主編，手段高明得很呢！=No, no, I can't say any more! She's the editor-in-chief of a top-selling scandal magazine, she's way too sharp!
要是我再多嘴，\n可是會被開除的……=If I keep running my mouth, I'll get fired for sure...
她那麼有影響力？=She's that influential?
似乎很不好惹啊=<size\=27>Seems difficult to deal with</size>
哎呀停止！\n不是，都說了真的不能聊這個啦！=Stop! Seriously, I can't talk about this!
請放心，我只是當參考消息而已……保證不會告訴其他人的。=Don't worry, I'll just use it as reference... I promise I won't tell anyone.
一定會保密的=I'll keep a secret
您就當吐個槽怎麼樣？=Think of it as venting?
哎……=Ugh...
……其實我最近，分鏡遇到了瓶頸。\n所以想把這麼有個性的人當做參考……=...Truth is, I'm in a slump with my storyboarding lately. Someone with her personality would be perfect reference material...
如果能有點進展，說不定就能接下您那邊畫封面的委託了……=If this helps me make progress, maybe I could even take on that cover illustration commission you mentioned...
真的嗎！\n是說給{{A}}特輯新畫的全彩封面嗎！=Really?! You mean the full color cover for the {{A}} special?
哎呀～那樣的話，我就再多說一點吧。\n但你們真的不要跟別人說……！=Well～ In that case, I guess I can spill a little more. But you swear this stays between us...!
反正，基本跟網上炒的差不多啦。\n再加上公司內部對她的風評……=Anyway, it's pretty much the same as what's online. Plus, there's how she's talked about within the company...
她真的、真的很不好對付，超級難搞！=She's seriously, seriously hard to deal with, super difficult!
然後呢，公司就分成了所謂的：\n「{{A}}派」和「反{{A}}派」啦……=The office is basically split into the "{{A}} faction" and the "Anti-{{A}} faction"...
不對，應該說是給{{A}}拍馬屁的、\n和其他人這兩種吧～=No, more like {{A}}'s bootlickers and everyone else～
畢竟要是不小心被她盯上了，\n是真的會被毀掉的……=Because if she decides you're in her way, she'll ruin you...
所以想在公司生存，不是好好奉承她，\n就是就閉上嘴低調地混日子吧。=To survive here, you have to either get on her good side, or keep your head down and hope she ignores you.
您說的「被毀掉」……是什麼意思呢？=You said "ruined"... what do you mean?
不管提出什麼案子，都會被{{A}}派挑刺，\n比如開會說話被無視，被逼少數服從多數……=Every proposal gets shot down by her faction, ignored in meetings or crushed by peer pressure.
說白了就是職場霸淩。\n連領導也不敢吭聲，任由員工被穿小鞋。=Basically power harassment. Even the boss won't cross her, so you're left unprotected.
說白了就是職場霸凌。\n連領導也不敢吭聲，任由員工被穿小鞋。=Basically power harassment. Even the boss won't cross her, so you're left unprotected.
她為什麼那麼有權力？=Why is she that powerful?
領導都不敢說不？=<size\=27>Even the boss stays silent?</size>
嗯……應該是因為她年輕的時候，\n搞定過很多獨家新聞，所以確實有真本事。=Well... Back in her early days, she landed many exclusives, so she does have real skills.
加上她也是BAKURO的盈利大頭啦。\n只要她能提高銷量，就沒人出來唱反調。=Plus, she's BAKURO's cash cow. As long as she boosts sales, nobody rocks the boat.
不過……以她現在的手段來看，\n當初那些獨家新聞大概也沒那麼簡單吧。=But... judging by her methods now, those early exclusives probably weren't exactly clean either.
她的手段是指？=What methods?
比如，她會收集一些小道消息，\n就是網上那種邊角料之類……=Like, she'll scrape together rumors, those sketchy online posts...
然後誇大其詞寫成報導，跟親眼見過似的。\n明明根本沒做什麼採訪取證。=Then exaggerate them into reports like she witnessed it firsthand. Even though there's never any interviews or fact-checking.
接著，會讓那些拍她馬屁的人，\n去找「適合這篇報導的假證據」。=Next, she'll have her lackeys "find false evidence that fits the article".
那樣就等於捏造了吧……\n她不會被起訴嗎？=That's just fabrication... Wouldn't she get sued?
當然會。不過你看，我們不是大公司嘛？\n有很厲害的律師呢～=Absolutely. But you see, we're a big company? We have many great lawyers～
而且，她擅長爆料藝人醜聞，\n在娛樂圈面子很大啦……=And she specializes in celebrity scandals, so she wields major influence in the industry...
大多數人都不敢反抗吧。跟她作對的話，\n公司和朋友都不會保護自己的……=Most people wouldn't dare to resist. Cross her, and even your company and friends won't protect you...
好可怕……=So scary...
對吧……但能放這種人橫行霸道，\n我們公司也就這樣啦……=Right?... But that's the kind of thing that goes on in our company....
要是想好好工作的話我可不推薦你來哦。\n雖然工資蠻高的。=If you want to work honestly, I wouldn't recommend this place. Though the pay is good.
要是想好好工作的話我可不推薦你來哦。\n雖然薪水蠻高的。=If you want to work honestly, I wouldn't recommend this place. Though the pay is good.
啊……不過，你倒是五官很正。\n也許很適合這家公司呢？=Ah... but you have a pretty good face. You might actually fit right in here?
五官很正？=Pretty face?
謝謝誇獎=Thanks for the compliment
哎呀？看來你被誇慣了呀？\n那個人可能喜歡再謙虛點的人呢～=Oh? Used to hearing that, huh? Though she might prefer someone humbler～
反正{{A}}最喜歡顏值高的了……\n如果把她哄好了，她肯定會好好關照你的。=Anyway, {{A}} loves pretty faces... If you play your cards right, she'd definitely take care of you.
至於那到底是福還是禍嘛……=As for whether it is a blessing or a curse...
啊，今天我說的可千千萬萬要保密哦？\n要是被{{A}}知道了……=Ah, what I say today must be kept secret, okay? If {{A}} finds out...
啊，今天我說的可千千萬萬要保密哦！\n要是被{{A}}知道了……=Ah, what I say today must be kept secret! If {{A}} finds out...
第二天我就會上熱門，\n然後被徹底衝爛了吧……=By tomorrow, I'll be trending online, and then socially executed...

今天辛苦了。=Good work today.
今天可太感謝了=Thanks for today
幫了大忙了=You saved me
我也趁此機會聽到了不少八卦呢。\n看來沒白答應他們畫封面圖。=I also took the chance to hear a lot of gossip. Seems like agreeing to draw the cover art wasn't a waste after all.

你不是想知道她的事嗎？\n那位{{A}}……=Didn't you want to know about her? That {{A}}...
今天之所以跟我一起來，\n也是想詳細調查她的背景吧？=The reason you came with me today, was to investigate her background in detail, right?
這傢伙，為何連這都……！=This guy, how could they even...!
r:"^啊！他在那兒！\n(.*)！$"="Ah! He's over there! $1!"
r:"^啊！他在那裡！\n(.*)！$"="Ah! He's over there! $1!"
{{A}}……？\n大家這是怎麼了？={{A}}...? What happened to you all?
r:"^啊，我們很擔心(.*)，\n所以就來(.*)邊逛邊等……$"="Ah, we were worried about $1, so we came to $2 to look around while waiting..."
來{{B}}……？\n{{A}}明明是在神保町吧？=To {{B}}...? But {{A}} is in Jinbocho?
啊，不是，那個……！\n今天不排練，所以我們想來吃頓好的！=Ah, no, that's...! We don't have practice today, so we wanted to eat something delicious!
……這樣啊。\n果然大家也都很想知道{{A}}的事呢。=...I see. So everyone's also curious about {{A}}.
也就是說……「{{B}}的下一個目標」，\n是{{A}}，對嗎？=That means... "The {{B}}' next target", is {{A}}, right?
{{A}}？你剛剛說什麼……={{A}}? What did you just say...
你你你在說什麼？=<size\=23>Wh-what are you talking about?</size>	
沒有必要掩飾啦。=There's no need to hide it.
哦！？=Oh!?
r:"^這個是(.*){{A}}包裡的……\n貓頭鷹，對吧？$"="This is the owl... in $1-senpai's bag, right?"
看看看錯了吧？=<size\=28>You must be mistaken?</size>	
你、你認錯鳥了吧？=<size\=27>You got the wrong bird?</size>	
是嗎？貓頭鷹在這裡可不常見哦。\n而且我覺得特徵也對得上……=Is that so? Owls aren't common around here. And I think the features match...
另外，我還親眼看到了。\n大家準備發{{A}}的一幕。=Besides, I saw it with my own eyes. The moment you all were preparing to send the calling card.
什麼……！=What...!
在{{A}}地鐵站的臺階那裡……=On the stairs at {{A}} Station...
你們聚在一起，在聊發{{A}}的事情吧？\n然後就拿起手機……=You all got together and were discussing sending the calling card, right? Then you started using your phone...
接著，{{A}}上就出現了……\n發給{{B}}的影片{{C}}。=And soon after, a video calling card appeared on {{A}}... The one sent to {{B}}.

也沒打算告訴任何人你們的真正身份。\n我只不過是……對大家很感興趣而已。=Nor will I reveal your true identities to anyone. I'm simply... very interested in all of you.
感興趣……？=Interested...?
我不是說過了嗎？\n作為採訪對象，大家能激發我的靈感。=Didn't I say it before? As interview subjects, you all inspire me.
真的是……因為這個？\n{{A}}，莫非你要把我們……=Is that... really all? {{A}}, are you planning to use us...
我沒有其他目的。\n我只想看看你們在做什麼，僅此而已。=No ulterior motives. I simply want to observe your activities, nothing more.
真正的怪盜……\n應該可以成為{{A}}的參考吧。=Real Phantom Thieves... Could serve as good references for {{A}}.
我們還沒說過自己是「怪盜」。\n就算假設我們是……=We haven't admitted to being "Phantom Thieves". But let's say we are...
也希望你不要把我們的真人畫進漫畫。=I hope you will avoid writing our true identities in the manga.
這點也請放心。\n你們只是靈感來源，不會出現真實名字的。=Don't worry about that either. I'm just trying to get some inspiration, I won't use real names.
所以，如果不介意的話，\n今後我也想繼續觀摩大家的活動……=So, if you don't mind, I'd like to continue observing your activities from now on...
然後像今天這樣，\n如果有需要的地方，我也會幫忙的。=Just like today, if there's anything you need help with, I'll gladly assist.

需要徵求大家的意見=Need everyone's input
……我知道了。=...Understood.
請放心，我真的不會打擾你們的。\n那我先告辭了。=Rest assured, I have no intention of getting in your way. I'll take my leave now.
怎怎怎怎！麼！辦！啊！\n露餡了！這不是露餡了嘛喂！！=Wh-Wh-Wh-What! What do we do now! We're exposed! Completely exposed!!
都怪{{A}}被拍下來了！=It's all because {{A}} got caught on camera!
吾也沒辦法吧！\n還不是因為你們在車站聊{{A}}的事！=It's unavoidable! You were the ones talking about the calling card at the station!
……不過的確，我們總是嘴上說要小心，\n但結果根本沒做到啊……=...But it's true. We always say we'll be careful, but we never actually are...
總之先冷靜一下=Let's stay calm
先緩一緩再說吧=Take a breather first
sr:"^……是啊。\n(.*)想必也累了。$"="...Yes. $1 must be tired too."
而且這裡人太多了。\n包括{{A}}的事，都等明天在基地聊吧。=And there are too many people here. We should talk about {{A}} and everything else tomorrow at the hideout.
可是，萬一{{A}}今天就對誰告密了……=But what if {{A}} reports us to someone today...
那我們很可能會被幕後黑手殺掉啊……！=Then we will most likely be killed by the mastermind...!
沒事吧……應該。=We'll be fine... probably.
如果她跟「幕後黑手」有關的話，\n我覺得她不會特意跑來找我們說這些的……=If she is connected to the "mastermind", I don't think she would have bothered to tell us...

----------
Day After Exposed by Aran
----------
{{A}}。吾一直都覺得她很可疑，\n原來是知道吾等的身份才來接觸的啊……={{A}}. I always thought she was suspicious, it turns out that she came to contact us because she knew our identities...
雖然露餡了是我們的錯……=Even if it was our fault that we got found out...
但她既不鬧，也不在{{A}}上投稿，\n只悄悄接近我們……我都起雞皮疙瘩了……=But she didn't make a scene or post about it on {{A}}, just quietly approached us... Gives me goosebumps...
錯不了，她就是幕後黑手的手下之類的吧？=No doubt about it, she's probably the mastermind's lackey or something?
就算是，\n我也不明白為什麼她要特意跟我們挑明。=Even if she is, I don't get why she even bothered to tell us.
如果是覺得我們礙眼，想除掉我們……\n暗中偷襲不是更方便嗎？=If she saw us as a threat and wanted to eliminate us... Wouldn't it be easier to ambush us in secret?
雖然她說是「感興趣」「想幫忙」之類……=Although she said she's "interested" and "wants to help"...
不能放鬆警惕=<size\=29>Can't let our guard down</size>
想要相信她=Want to trust her
Choice 1
是啊。肯定不能把我們的怪盜活動，\n那麼輕易地全盤托出。=Yes. We definitely can't just casually spill everything about our Phantom Thief activities.
而且我們是在{{A}}活動，\n沒法給她看啊。=Plus, we operate in the {{A}}, we can't really show her.
不過，\n我們如果刻意回避她的話也很危險。=But if we deliberately avoid her, that's risky too.
如果她真是敵人，\n這樣反而會刺激到她……=If she really is an enemy, that will only irritate her...
Choice 2
r:"^你這也太天真了吧，(.*)。$"="You're way too naive, $1."
我懂你。我也覺得她雖然有點怪，\n但其實是個好孩子……=I get it. I also think she's a little odd, but I also think she's a good person...
那也不能就這麼相信她，然後交代一切。\n但反過來想……=Still, we can't just blindly trust her and reveal everything. But on the other hand...
如果徹底回避她的話，也很危險。=If if we deliberately avoid her, that's risky too.
畢竟，她如果真的是敵人，\n這樣反而會刺激到她……=After all, if she really is an enemy, that will only irritate her...
那我們該怎麼辦啊？=Then what should we do?
跟之前一樣，當做兩校合演的團隊成員，\n和她正常接觸就行了吧？=Just keep things as usual, play the joint play collaborators role and act normal, right?
正常聊天，正常回家。\n但是我們不要主動聊起工作的話題。=Chat normally, go home normally. But we don't talk about the work ourselves.
那要是{{A}}問起來怎麼辦？=What if {{A}} asks about it?
那就只好說無可奉告了吧……\n畢竟隨便敷衍是行不通的。=Then we'll have to say we can't disclose that... No point in being evasive anyway.
不撒謊，也不敷衍，只說「無可奉告」？\n感覺很好辦呢！=No lying, no being evasive, just "I can't disclose that"? Think I can do that!
就說雖然無法告訴她工作的細節，\n但希望能正常做朋友……這樣吧。=Let's tell her we can't discuss work specifics, but we'd still like to stay on good terms...
唔，確實這樣比較穩妥呢。=Hmm, that would be the more judicious approach.
如果她還是執意打聽的話，\n吾等再考慮下一步的對策吧。=If she keeps pressing for info, then we'll figure out our next move.
r:"^那麼，(.*)。\n接下來你來說說在(.*)打聽到的消息吧。$"="Then, $1. Let's share what you found out at $2."
她在公司裡名聲也這麼差啊……\n真是從裡到外都壞透了。=She even has such a bad reputation in the company... She's rotten to the core.
不出所料啊。\n這種人，也難怪能到處瞎寫虛假報導。=Just as I expected. She just wrote a bunch of exaggerated articles.
是啊，整個公司都知道了的話，\n那肯定不是一次兩次了。=Yeah, if the whole company knew about it, it must've happened more than once or twice.
而且，\n在公司裡她是被馬屁精們捧著的吧？=And in the company, she's surrounded by bootlickers, right?
那在{{A}}也一樣？=<size\=24>It's the same in the {{A}}</size>
所以反映到了認知中？=<size\=29>That's reflected in her cognition</size>
原來如此！{{B}}裡的那些螞蟻們，\n之所以那麼討好{{A}}……=I see! That's why the Shadows in her {{B}} were all fawning over {{A}}...
就是因為對於她來說，\n全公司都是阿諛奉承她的僕人吧。=To her, the whole company is just many yes-men.
{{A}}，真過分……={{A}}, that's terrible...
這樣一來，\n如果要通過被陰影們堵住的那個入口……=So if we want to get past that entrance blocked by Shadows...
就要成為她的下屬=<size\=27>Have to become her lackey</size>
必須被她看中=Need to win her favor
應該沒錯。只不過……\n要怎樣才能「被她相中」呢？=That should be correct. But... how do we "win her favor"?
sr:"^(.*)，那個(.*)編輯說過，\n你的顏值不錯，可能會被相中哦……$"="$1, that editor at $2 said, you have a pretty face, she might take a liking to you..."
顏值！？什麼意思？=Pretty face!? What's that supposed to mean?
r:"^啊，我記得在中央大街的時候也是，\n她好像挺中意(.*)和(.*)的吧？$"="Ah, back in the Central Street, she seemed to like $1 and $2, right?"
r:"^的確！啊，那就讓(.*)和(.*)，\n一起色誘(.*)……？$"="Exactly! Ah, then what if $1 and $2 try to, seduce $3...?"
開什麼玩笑=Are you kidding me
我不想幹……=I don't want to...
加油啊，{{A}}！=Keep it up, {{A}}!
Choice 1
就是啊！\n這也太強人所難了吧！=That's right! This is too much to ask!
Choice 2
r:"^對吧！？\n還好(.*)我倆一條心……$"="Right!? Glad we're on the same page, $1..."
Choice 3
別光甩給我啊！\n而且這跟加不加油有啥關係啊！=Don't just dump this on me! And what does "keep it up" even mean here!
嗯，確實太冒險了……\n暫且把它作為我們的底牌吧。=Yes, it is too dangerous... Let's keep it as a last resort.
別隨便搞這種底牌啊……=Don't just casually add it as a last resort...
……嗯，下午的課馬上要開始了。=...Hmm, the afternoon classes are about to start.
總之先回教室吧。\n大家回去都想想接近{{A}}的辦法。=Let's head back to the classroom for now. Everyone, think of ways to get close to {{A}}.
r:"^今天也要排練哦！\n去體育館吧，(.*)。$"="We've got rehearsal today too! Let's go to the gym, $1."
好的，走吧！=Alright, let's go!
還有事情要做=Got things to do
喔，真有幹勁啊！\n那就趕緊去體育館吧，Let's go！=Oh, you're really motivated! Then let's hurry to the gym! Let's go!
啊，難道是要去小賣部買點東西吃嗎……？\n{{A}}，開玩笑的啦！那就等會兒再見囉！=Ah, going to the store to buy some snacks...? {{A}}, just kidding! See you later!

----------
4rd Rehearsal
----------
……嗯，我一切都很好。\n媽媽你呢？=...Mmm, I'm doing just fine. What about you, mom?
這樣啊，那就好。=I see, that's good to hear.
我爸？嗯，還是那麼忙。\n……我有好好吃飯，放心吧。=Dad? Yes, still as busy as ever. \n...Don't worry, I've been eating properly.
學校這邊也都很順利。\n對，在忙戲劇部的事。馬上就要比賽了。=School's going well too. Yes, the drama club has a competition coming up.
大家人都很好，我們相處得很開心哦。=I'm surrounded by great friends, we get along great.
……媽媽你為什麼道歉啊。\n沒必要的。=...Mom, why are you apologizing? There's no need for that.
好，媽媽你也要注意身體。\n那先這樣。嗯，Ciao（再見）。=Alright, you take care of yourself too. That's all for now. Yes, Ciao (Goodbye).
你們來啦。\n怎麼了？幹嘛杵在那裡。=Yo. What's up? Why just standing there?
你剛才在打電話？=<size\=30>Were you on the phone?</size>
「媽媽」？="Mom"?
{{A}}，被你們聽到了啊。\n對，我跟我媽會定期電話聯繫。={{A}}, you heard that. Yes, I call my mom regularly.
她在國外生活，\n所以這樣時不時互相聊聊近況。=She lives abroad, so we check in like this from time to time.
{{A}}……你跟媽媽不住在一起啊？\n是因為工作嗎？={{A}}... you don't live with your mom? Is it because of work?
嗯。我媽太忙了，要到處跑。\n所以就住在國外了。=Hm. Mom's always traveling for work, so she stays overseas.
每年大概回日本一兩次吧。=She comes back to Japan maybe once or twice a year.
好辛苦啊=That sounds tough
你不會想她嗎？=Don't you miss her?
畢竟從小就這樣，我已經習慣啦。=I've been used to it since I was little.
我很尊敬她能以事業為重。\n而且就像剛才那樣，我們也常聯繫。=I really respect her dedication to her career. And like you just heard, we keep in touch.
所以……嗯，沒什麼好寂寞的。=So... well, there's nothing to be lonely about.
來，我們進體育館吧。快點排練！=Come, let's head inside the gym. Time for rehearsal!
剛才他在電話裡……\n他說跟{{A}}戲劇部「關係很好」……=Earlier on the phone... He said he "gets along great" with the {{A}} drama club...
不知道是不是不想告訴母親，\n自己與戲劇部的人其實有矛盾……=I wonder if he didn't want to tell his mom about the tension between him and the others...
好了，今天我們來全部過一遍吧。\n從第一幕到最後一幕，一口氣哦！=Alright, today we're running through the whole thing. From the first scene to the last scene, nonstop!
「呼，看來今天到此為止了。\n期待再會，{{A}}的各位！」="Whew, looks like that's it for today. Until we meet again, members of the {{A}}!"
「等著瞧……\n我們一定會追上你的……」="Just you wait... We'll catch up to you someday..."
「然後，奪回幸福的未來！\n我們是……」="And take back our happy future! We are..."
三人=Three People
「{{A}}！」="{{A}}!"
好，很不錯！=Alright, okay!
好耶，我們這還是頭一回一口氣演完吧！\n而且感覺演得還很不錯啊！是吧！=Woohoo! This is the first time we've performed it all in one go! And I feel like the acting was pretty good! Right!
就是很棒吧？\n雖然還有點小錯。=It was awesome, wasn't it? Even though there were a few hiccups.
就算是忘詞的地方，\n大家也都能靠即興表演連下去呢。=Even when someone forgot a line, everyone just improvised through it smoothly.
這證明大家已經把整部戲都牢牢記住了，\n是把角色演活了的證明哦。=That proves you've all internalized the script, it's a sign you've become your characters.
我們做到了！=We did it!
{{A}}覺得呢？=<size\=22>What do you think, {{A}}?</size>
{{A}}你覺得呢？=<size\=29>What do you think, {{A}}?</size>
是在問我作為原作者的意見嗎？\n嗯……=Are you asking for the author's opinion? Hmm...
我覺得大家都能準確解讀角色，演得很好。=I think everyone really understood their characters and acted them out wonderfully.
嗯，我覺得和剛開始的時候相比，\n大家簡直進步太多了。=Yes, compared to when you first started, the improvement is unbelievable.
就算作為一名普通觀眾，\n我也看得相當滿足。=Even just as an audience member, I was thoroughly impressed.
當然也還有些不足，\n比如{{A}}經常說不順臺詞……=Of course, there's still room for improvement, like {{A}} stumbling over his lines...
嗚，抱歉啊！=Ugh, sorry about that!
不過……能切實感受到{{A}}的熱情。\n就像真的「媽媽」一樣呢。=But... I could feel {{A}}'s passion. It was like watching a real "mother".
真假，我演出了真正的「媽媽」……！=For real, I played a real "mother"...!
等等，我該高興嗎……？=Wait, should I be happy...?
r:"^(.*){{C}}、{{A}}，\n還有{{B}}，大家都很認真。$"="$1-senpai, {{A}}, and {{B}}, you were all so serious."
雖然和漫畫中的{{A}}們不完全一樣，\n但是大家演出了各自心目中的形象……=Though it's not exactly like the manga protagonists, you brought your own interpretations to life...
啊，沒事。\n{{A}}的演技真的很厲害。=Ah, right. {{A}}'s acting was excellent as expected.
……看起來你像是欲言又止啊。\n用不著顧慮，有話直說吧。=...Looks like you're hesitant to speak. Don't worry, just say what you're thinking.
沒有，請別在意。\n我對演技可是門外漢。=No, it's nothing. Please ignore me. I'm no expert on acting.
不，拜託你了。對演員來說，\n批評也是演技的源泉。=No, please. For actors, criticism is also a source of skills.
你就直說吧。=Just say it straight.
……那好吧。\n如果我說錯了，還請你不要介意。=...Right. If I'm wrong, please don't mind.
我剛剛突然發現，我好像……\n對{{A}}的演技「沒印象」。=It just hit me... I have "no impression" of {{A}}'s performance.
素描也是……明明其他人都畫了好多，\n但{{A}}的卻沒幾幅。=Even in the sketches... I drew so many of the others, but barely any of {{A}}.
不過畢竟演的是壞人角色，\n也許你是特意這麼表現的……=Though, since you're playing the villain, maybe that was intentional...
總之……\n感覺是種沒有留下印象的演技。=Anyway... it's like your acting left no impression.
我太沒禮貌了。對不起。\n也許是因為演得太好了，才沒留下痕跡呢。=That's rude. Sorry. Maybe it was so good that it didn't leave much of an impression.
不……你說得太對了。\n不愧是{{A}}，觀察力很強。=No... you're absolutely right. As expected from {{A}}, you have a keen eye.
劇團的夥伴也對我說過同樣的話。\n他們說，在我的表演中看不到「我自己」。=The drama club members said the same thing. They told me they couldn't see "myself" in my acting.
你自己？=Youself?
他們說我演得很好，也很有感染力。\n但是……「感覺不一定非要我來演」。=They said I acted well and was very charismatic. But... "it didn't have to be me acting it".
要是配角倒還行，但作為主角的話，\n無法給人留下深刻印象是不合格的。=It's fine for a side character, but as a lead, failing to leave an impact is a failure.
真的假的……要我說，\n總之就是演得很好啊……=For real... I mean, I thought you were great...
我也是……=Me too...
我也覺得演技很好=<size\=21>I also thought the acting was great</size>
大概就是有技術，但缺乏激情吧。\n這樣是當不了明星的。=It's like having skill but lacking passion. I can't become a star like this.
哦，\n就像是味道不錯但沒特點的拉麵嗎……=Oh, it's like ramen that tastes good but has no distinctive features...
啊，抱歉！=Ah, sorry!
{{A}}，沒事。我覺得你的比喻很恰當。=Haha, no worries. That's actually a perfect analogy.
只不過這個問題……\n在學園祭之前恐怕是克服不了了。抱歉。=It's just this... isn't something I can fix before the school festival. My apologies.
這就是{{A}}作為演員，\n今後要攻克的課題吧。=This is one of {{A}}'s future challenges as an actor.
沒錯。{{A}}，謝謝你。\n抱歉讓你說了些難以啟齒的話。=Exactly. Thank you, {{A}}. And sorry for making you say something difficult.
沒關係……=It's okay...
那，時間不早了。\n今天就到這裡吧。=Well, it's getting late. Let's call it a day.
好的，各位辛苦了。\n今天我還有工作要做，先告辭了……=Okay, everyone, good work today. I have work today, so I'll go first...
我說……\n{{A}}是不是有點失落啊？=Hey... Did {{A}} seem kinda down to you?
應該是在想{{A}}的話吧……=Probably thinking about what {{A}} said...
這種時候就是那個了，{{A}}！=It's time, {{A}}!
這種時候就去吃拉麵吧！=Time for ramen!
……你是說拉麵嗎！=...Did you say ramen!
是啊！拉麵！=Yes! Ramen!
嗯？拉麵？=Huh? Ramen?
沒錯，我知道家超級好吃的拉麵！\n我們一起去吧，{{A}}！=Right, I know an amazing ramen place! Let's go together, {{A}}!
{{A}}，你們要去吃拉麵嗎！？\n那我也要去！={{A}}, you guys are getting ramen!? \nI wanna go too!
不行哦，{{A}}。不是說今天回去時，\n要一起去看女生服裝的布料嗎？=No, {{A}}. Didn't we say we'd check out fabrics for girls' outfits on the way back?
哎呀……！我想起來了……！=Oops...! I remembered...!
下次再大家一起吧=<size\=28>Let's go together next time</size>
等什麼時候有機會=<size\=26>When we get another chance</size>
也是，今天{{A}}也不在。\n那你們3個吃好哦～=Right, {{A}} is not here either. Then you three enjoy the meal～
我們就先走啦。=We'll take our leave.
好，那今天就來一場男人們的拉麵大餐！\n我們走起，{{A}}！=Right, let's have a ramen feast for the guys today! Let's go, {{A}}!
噢、噢……？=O-Oh...?

嗯……Buono！！=Mmm... Buono!!
這拉麵什麼來頭啊……！\n也太好吃了吧！=What's this ramen...! It's so good!
我就說吧！\n關鍵是這個湯底，鰹魚湯底！=Told you! The key is the broth, bonito broth!
Buono？=Buono?
剛才說的是義大利語嗎？=Was that Italian just now?
啊，我又說順嘴了。\n抱歉，因為拉麵太好吃了，不小心就……=Ah, I said it again. Sorry, the ramen was just so good, it came out naturally...
對哦，{{A}}偶爾會說外語呢。\n「Bravo」，還有B……「Bene」？=Yeah, {{A}} sometimes throws in foreign words. Like "Bravo" and B... "Bene"?
Bene是義大利語「OK」的意思，\nBravo是「很棒」的意思。=Bene means "OK" in Italian, Bravo means "great".
Buono的話，就是「好吃」的意思啦。=And "Buono" means "tasty".
我媽媽是義大利人，\n所以從小就耳濡目染了。=My mom is Italian, so I picked it up growing up.
真的嗎！\n那……你爸爸是日本人嗎？=For real! Then... your dad is Japanese?
沒錯，我是義大利和日本混血。=Yes, I'm half Italian and half Japanese.
雖然我基本是聽日語長大的，\n不過語氣詞什麼的還是受我媽媽的影響。=Although I basically grew up speaking Japanese, my little interjections and such are still influenced by my mom.
一放鬆下來就會不小心說出口……=When I relax, they just slip out...
你隨時都可以放鬆的=You can relax anytime
希望在我們面前你能做自己=<size\=25>Hope you can be yourself around us</size>
嗯，但是……=Hmm, but...
r:"^就是呀，(.*)說得對，\n做自己就行啦！難得現在只有男生呢！$"="Come on, $1's right, just be yourself! It's just us guys here anyway!"
嗯……啊～=Hmm... Sigh～
今天{{A}}說的……\n從我的演技裡「看不到我自己」……=Today, what {{A}} said... that she "couldn't see myself" in my acting...
其實不止是演戲。=It's not just about acting.
不止是在舞臺上。\n我平時也老這樣，不袒露真正的自己……=Not just on stage. Even in everyday life, I don't show my true self...
我總是在「撒謊」。=I'm always "lying".
撒謊是指……=Lying...
就是字面意思啦。\n不管對誰，我都沒展現過真正的自己。=Literally. I don't show my true colors in front of anyone.
這感覺就像是……\n我一直在飾演「{{A}}」這個角色。=It's like... I've been playing the role of "{{A}}".
可……不過……\n這跟撒謊可是兩碼事吧？=But... that's not the same as lyin', right?
但也肯定不是「誠實」。=But it's definitely not "honest", either.
事到如今……連我自己都忘了，\n究竟要如何展現真正的自我了。=At this point... I don't even remember how to show my true self.
只有像這樣吃到好吃的，\n或者剛演出完很興奮的時候……=Only when eating something incredible, or right after a show when I'm still buzzing...
才能找回一點真正的自己……=That's when I feel like my true self is coming back...
而在平時，\n隱藏自己已經成了一種習慣了。=But the rest of the time, hiding's just second nature.
為什麼要這麼做？=Why do this?
是跟家裡有關係嗎？=Is it related to family?
sr:"^(.*)知道，\n我媽媽一直住在義大利。$"="$1 knows, my mother has always lived in Italy."
sr:"^……猜對了。(.*)知道吧，\n我媽媽一直住在義大利。$"="...Bingo. $1 knows, my mother has always lived in Italy."
不是說我父母人不好，或者關係差哦？\n我很喜歡他們，也很尊敬他們。=Not that my parents are bad people or have a bad relationship. I love and respect them.
不是說我父母人不好，或者關係差哦！\n我很喜歡他們，也很尊敬他們。=Not that my parents are bad people or have a bad relationship. I love and respect them.
只不過……嗯，因為一些原因，\n我們一家不得不兩地分居。=But... well, for some reasons, we had to live apart.
一些原因？=Some reasons?
這個嘛～就是我的私事啦。\n不，不如說是父母的私事。=That's～ More of a personal matter. Or rather, my parents' private matter.
反正就因為這個……\n在父母面前，我就一直扮演著好孩子。=Anyway, because of that... I've always played the good child in front of them.
為了不讓他們擔心，不給他們添麻煩，\n我就藏起了感情，成了這麼個人。=In order not to make them worry and cause them trouble, I hid my feelings, and became this.
不過他們真的是很好的父母哦？\n夫妻關係很好，也都很愛我，我懂。=But they're really great parents. They love each other, they love me, I know that.
不過他們真的是很好的父母哦！\n夫妻關係很好，也都很愛我，我懂。=But they're really great parents. They love each other, they love me, I know that.
但這大概就是我的本性。\n這麼一想，就更覺得對不起他們……=But maybe this is just who I am. And that just makes me feel even guiltier...
我……能理解{{A}}。不想讓父母擔心，\n所以不能讓他們看到真正的自己。=I... get it, {{A}}. Not wanting to burden your parents, so you can't show them your true self.
我是單親家庭，老媽工作非常辛苦。\n為了不讓她擔心……=I grew up with a single mom who worked herself to the bone. In order to not make her worry...
比如我想她啦，還有學校裡的事啦……\n這些我都故意不去跟她說。=Things like I missed her, or stuff at school... I won't deliberately tell her those.
怎麼說呢……就因為愛自己的爸媽，\n所以才有話說不出口……吧。=How to say it... There are some things you can't say because you love your parents...
是吧。對了，你也別總對我用敬語了。\n隨意就好，隨意。=Yes. Right, and drop the honorifics when addressing me. Just talk normally.
真的？那就，{{B}}！\n……不對，還是得叫{{A}}吧？=Seriously? Then, {{B}}! ...No, I should still call you {{A}}.
r:"^就叫我(.*)就行，我也直接叫你(.*)。\n(.*)也是哦！$"="Just call me $1, and I'll just call you $2. You too, $3!"
現在的{{A}}就在做自己=<size\=29>The {{A}} now is the true self</size>
{{A}}的語氣也完全不同了=<size\=26>{{A}}'s tone is completely different</size>
{{A}}，的確！\n因為這拉麵太好吃了，嘴都軟了。={{A}}, true! The ramen's so good, I'm acting soft.
事到如今，\n也沒必要在你們面前裝酷擺架子了。=At this point, there's no need to keep acting cool around you guys.
{{A}}，原來你之前都在裝酷啊。={{A}}, turns out you were just pretending to be cool.
那當然啦。\n畢竟我的影片那麼紅，還登過雜誌。=Of course. After all, my video went viral and had even been featured in magazines.
所以我覺得……\n應該「演」得更像模像樣一點吧。=So I figured... I had to "act" the part.
已經不用演了=<size\=30>No need to act anymore</size>
做{{A}}自己就好=Just be {{A}}
……我也覺得！=...I think so too!
那我就直說了，我還沒吃飽呢！\n不然再加份麵吧！=Then I'll say it straight, I'm still hungry! Let's order another bowl!
說得好！那乾脆再來一碗！\n除了醬油拉麵，味噌拉麵也很棒哦。=Now we're talking! Let's have a second one! Soy ramen's good, but miso's killer too.
Bravo！好！\n打擾一下，我想點單！=Bravo! Right! Excuse me, we'd like to order!
啊～吃飽了吃飽了。\n糟了，接下來得節食了啊。=Ah～ So full. Oh no, I have to go on a diet after this.
是該鍛煉吧，練肌肉。\n把吃的變成肌肉就行啦。=Just exercise and build muscle. Turn all this food into gains.
畢竟肌肉永遠可靠=Muscles are forever
看！我的肌肉！=Look! My muscles!
{{A}}，\n果然男生一起玩就很開心啊！={{A}}, it's fun hanging out with the guys!
說實話，有女孩子時我總是小心翼翼的……\n這和隱藏真實的自己又不是一回事。=Honestly, I'm always on guard around girls... though that's different from hiding myself.
跟女生說話的時候，\n難道你們不緊張嗎？=You guys get nervous talking to girls too, right?
我懂！\n會很怕說錯話啥的。=Totally! Always worried about saying the wrong thing.
我還以為{{A}}你不會這樣呢。\n畢竟不是總有女生圍著你轉嘛？=I thought you wouldn't be like this, {{A}}. Aren't there always girls around you?
就算是粉絲，我也會緊張啊！=Even with fans, I still panic!
為何聚集在我周圍的都是女孩子……\n這是為何、為何……！=Why is it always girls around me... Why, why...!
搞了半天你還是在炫耀阿！=You're still showing off!
不不，我真不是在炫耀！\n我現在超想聊一些很蠢的話題！=No, no, I'm really not! I really want to talk about something dumb right now!
讓我們來一場只有男孩子才懂的、\n無聊吹牛大會吧！！=Let's have a stupid bragging session that only guys can understand!!
就這樣三個人一起，\n因為各種無聊至極的話題大笑……=The three of us laughed at all kinds of stupid topics together...
啊～今天真是「吃飽笑足」了……\n好久沒這麼開心過了呢。=Ah～ We really "live it up" today... Haven't had this much fun in ages.
{{A}}，我還有家推薦的店呢。\n下次我們去那家吧。={{A}}, I know another great shop. Let's hit it up next time.
Bene！我期待著呢。=Bene! Looking forward to it.
那，今天謝謝你們啦！\n明天見，Ciao！=Alright, thanks for today! See you tomorrow, Ciao!
哦～Ciao！=Yeah～ Ciao!

5th Rehearsal
----------
好，大型道具都差不多了。\n就剩下一些小道具了。=Okay, the large props are mostly done. Now we just have some small props left.
比如{{A}}們的武器，\n必須要好好製作才行～！=Like the weapons for the protagonists, we need to make sure they're well-crafted～!
嗯。{{A}}，能給我看一下人設圖嗎？=Hmm. {{A}}, can I see the character design illustrations?
啊，好的。給你。=Ah, sure. Here you go.
原來如此……這個的話，\n應該能用泡沫塑膠之類的材料搞定？=I see... For this, maybe we can use foam or something similar?
哇，{{A}}的武器啊！\n我超想用用看呢！=Wow, the {{A}}'s weapons! I'd love to try using them!
啊……話說回來，我們還得準備服裝呢！=Ah... Speaking of which, we still need to prepare the costumes!
還有負責音響、燈光的工作人員呢……\n我問過其他{{A}}了，他們都很忙。=And the staff for sound and lighting... I asked the other {{A}}s, but they're all busy.
另外，{{B}}和{{A}}，\n雖然能一人分飾好幾個角色……=Also, {{B}} and {{A}} can each play multiple roles, but...
但有些場景行不通吧。\n尤其是這場戰鬥戲……=Some scenes just won't work. Especially this fight scene...
對。剛演完一個雜兵，\n馬上又作為BOSS登場的確有點兒傻……=Right. It's a bit silly to appear as a boss right after appearing as a small fry...
對。剛演完一個雜兵，\n馬上又作為BOSS登場的確有一點傻……=Right. It's a bit silly to appear as a boss right after appearing as a small fry...
起碼再來1個……\n不，最好能再來3個演員啊……=We need at least one more... No, ideally three more actors...
{{A}}說她已經答應要給各種攤位幫忙，\n所以來不了……={{A}} said she's already promised to help with various stalls, so she can't make it...
sr:"^(.*)有沒有合適的人選啊？\n……不過，要是有的話你早就叫來了吧。$"="$1, do you know anyone who could help? ...Though if you did, you'd have called them already, right?"
想不到還有誰……=<size\=27>Can't think of anyone else...</size>
其實還真有……=Actually...
{{A}}……看來輪到我登場了。={{A}}... Looks like it's my time to shine.
{{A}}……是誰！？={{A}}... Who!?
{{A}}……問得好。\n雖然一言難盡……硬要說的話……={{A}}... Good question. It's hard to explain in a few words... But if I had to say...
我是……「{{A}}」。=I am... "{{A}}".
我已經知曉你們的困境了。\n現在你們身陷「深淵迷宮」裡……=I've already grasped your predicament. Right now, you're trapped in the "Abyss Labyrinth"...
而離開迷宮，就需要「{{A}}」……\n也就是我的指引。=And to escape the labyrinth, you need the guidance of the "{{A}}"... that is, me.
{{A}}，完全不知道這人在說什麼……={{A}}, I have no idea what this guy's talking about...
r:"^話說回來，他到底是誰啊？\n(.*)你知道嗎？$"="Speaking of, who even is he? $1, do you know him?"
是誰來著……？=Who...?
我不認識=I don't know them
他是「深淵的引導者」=He is the "Abyssal Guide"

Choice 1
不是吧不是吧！\n你別這樣啊！？=No no! Don't be like this!?
Choice 2
我是{{B}}啊！高一的{{A}}！=I'm {{B}}! A first-year! {{A}}!
Choice 3
r:"^呼……不愧是與我同為「{{A}}」的，\n(.*){{B}}。$"="Ha... As expected of my fellow "{{A}}", $1-senpai."
我是高一的{{A}}……\n和{{B}}同為被命運指引之人。=I'm {{A}}, a first-year... A fellow seeker guided by fate.
是、是這樣啊……\n喔……喔唷～=Oh, I see... O-okay～
大家不是正在犯愁嗎？\n我都明白的。=You're all worried, right? I get it.
你們在等待一個，能站上舞臺中央的、\n命定的隊友……沒錯吧？=You're waiting for a destined comrade to stand at the center of the stage... Right?
好繞啊這個人……\n是說，你也想演出是嗎？=This guy's such a pain... \nSo, you want to join the play?
唔！\n就、就是這個意思。=Guh! W-Well, yeah, that's the idea.
真的嗎！那你倒是直說啊！\n什麼深淵啊命運啊，你說這些誰懂啊！=Really? Then just say so! Who understands all that "abyss" and "fate" stuff!
{{B}}——！太好了！\n{{A}}對吧？太感謝你啦！={{B}}-! That's great! {{A}}, right? \nThank you so much!
沒、沒什麼……畢竟這也是命運的安排。\n區區小事，不足掛齒。=N-no problem... It's just fate's will. \nA small matter, really.
不知為何，\n高一的{{A}}願意參加演出……=For some reason, {{A}}, a first-year, is willing to join the play...
很感謝{{A}}的參與。\n但就算這樣，我們人手還是不夠……=We're grateful for {{A}}'s help, but even with him, we're still short on people...
好吧。那我再去試試，\n跟我們戲劇部的人聊聊。=Alright. I'll try talking to the drama club again.
{{A}}？他們不是說過不想幫忙嗎……={{A}}? But they already said they didn't want to help...
如果他們看過我們現在的演技，\n我想是有可能回心轉意的。=If they see how much we've improved, I think they might change their minds.
因為和你們一起演出，\n就是很開心嘛！=Because acting with you all is just so much fun!
死馬當作活馬醫吧=Give it a shot
嗯，交給我吧！\n我會好好說服他們的。=Yes, leave it to me! \nI'll convince them properly.
因為上次的事，可能讓你們印象有點差……\n但他們對演戲都很上心，人也很好。=They might've seemed rude to you... but they're actually passionate actors and good people.
哇……糟了。=Wow... Oh no.
之前提交的分鏡需要修改。\n抱歉，我先回去了……=I need to revise the submitted storyboard. \nSorry, I must go...
哇，那可是個大工程……！\n加油啊，{{A}}！=Whoa, that's a big task...! \nGood luck, {{A}}!
嗯嗯，我先告辭了……！=Mmm, I'll take my leave...!
既要當漫畫家，又要當學生，\n一定很辛苦吧……=Being both a manga artist and a student must be tough...
好了，我們繼續排練吧。\n{{A}}，你來看看這裡……=Alright, let's get back to rehearsing. {{A}}, take a look at this...
Bene！你演得很不錯啊，{{A}}。=Bene! Your acting is great, {{A}}.
畢、畢竟我可是「{{A}}」嘛……=W-Well, I am a "{{A}}" after all...
好了，今天的練習到此為止。\n我們來想想服裝和小道具的問題吧。=Okay, that's it for today's practice. Let's think about the costumes and small props.
自己從頭開始剪裁很難吧。\n最好還是用類似的衣服改一下……=Making them from scratch would be hard. \nMaybe we can modify existing clothes...
打擾一下～\n{{B}}的{{A}}在嗎？=Excuse me～ Is {{A}} from {{B}} here?
{{B}}？{{A}}？={{B}}? {{A}}?
我就是{{A}}……=I am {{A}}...
啊，{{A}}！能請你來一下嗎？\n有個人在校門口吵著要找你……=Ah, {{A}}! Can you please come here for a moment? Someone is clamoring to find you at the gate...

Met KOKORO

我都說過了！\n未經許可，外人不能隨便進入校園！=I've told you before! Unauthorized outsiders are not allowed to enter the school grounds without permission!
必須先填寫申請表……=You must fill out an application first...
呵欠～～～=Yawn～～～
只知道遵守死規則，\n不知道靈活變通……=All you know is blindly following rigid rules, \nwith no flexibility at all...
用這種思想來教書，\n貴校的學生還真是可憐。=Teaching with this kind of mindset, \nyour students must be pitiful.
連入校目的和逗留時間也不問，\n用統一申請當藉口，合理性在哪？嗯？=Not even inquiring about our purpose or duration, just hiding behind bureaucratic formalities? How utterly absurd.
唔……當然是為了保證學生的安全！=Uh... Of course, it's to ensure student safety!
填寫申請表與學生的安全有什麼關係？=How, precisely, does scribbling on a form ensure student safety?
難道說你們學校，\n把所有外來者都一杆子打成危險分子？=Or does this institution simply presume every outsider to be a threat?
不是這個意思……=That's not what I meant...
那是什麼意思？\n我沒空聽你狡辯，請你正面回答。=Elaborate. I'll not suffer your equivocations, respond plainly.
哎呀，{{A}}～=Ara, {{A}}～
果然是您啊……\n這到底是怎麼回事？=So it is you... What exactly is going on here?
{{A}}……這位是……={{A}}... This is...?
YO！你就是{{A}}？\n不錯哦！比影片裡還要性感！=YO! You must be {{A}}? Nice! \nEven sexier than in the video!
難道您是……{{A}}？\n那位有名的製作人？=Wait... Are you... {{A}}? \nThe famous producer?
YEAH！你認識我啊？\n真開心～這麼說我還挺有名的吼？=YEAH! You know me? So happy～ \nGuess I'm pretty well-known, huh?
那當然！\n在整個業界沒人不知道您的名字……！=Of course! Your name is legendary in the entire industry...!
我是{{A}}。{{B}}！=I am {{A}}. {{B}}!
矮油～！不要這麼拘謹YO！\n老實說哦，我今天來就是專程為了你啦！=Aww～! No need to be so formal, YO! Honestly, I came here just for you today!
穿、穿得好個性啊……\n是叫{{A}}嗎？=S-stands out so much... This is {{A}}?
沒錯，這位監製過很多舞臺和電影作品……=Exactly, he's produced countless stage and film works...
竟然不認識{{A}}，\n這些門外漢就是有眼無珠啊。=To be ignorant of {{A}}, \nhow utterly plebeian.
他之前是電視臺超～厲害的導演哦。\n現在出來自己幹了……=He used to be a brilliant～legendary TV director. Now he's independent...
舞臺、電影、演唱會……\n他可是什麼都很拿手的頂級製作人呢。=Stage, cinema, concerts... \na true virtuoso of production. 
{{B}}！不要客氣啦，\n直接叫我「{{A}}」就對了！={{B}}! And don't be shy, \njust call me "{{A}}"!
那為什麼……\n{{B}}會跟{{A}}來這裡？=But why... is {{B}} here with {{A}}?
{{C}}，準備開心吧，{{A}}！\n你要當{{B}}電視劇的主演了！={{C}}, get ready to celebrate, {{A}}! {{B}} has graciously chosen you as the lead!
主演！？=Lead!?
YES！其實我現在吼，\n在策劃一個超酷超炫的網劇哦！=YES! Actually, right now, I'm planning a super cool and flashy web series!
正好在找主演，{{A}}就講說，\n有個超讚超合適的人選YO！=I was looking for a lead, and {{A}} here said there's an amazing perfect candidate, YO!
哼哼，我可是幫你好好舉薦了一把哦。\n快感謝我吧，{{A}}！=Hmph, I did go out of my way to endorse you, you know. You'd best be grateful, {{A}}!
{{A}}，你是被「有毒父母」養大的吧？={{A}}, you were raised by "toxic parents", right?
阿……？=Huh...?
這次要拍的電視劇呀，\n就是以超熱門的「有毒父母」為主題的YO！=This drama we're making, is all about the super hot topic of "toxic parents", YO!
家庭的陰暗面，\n簡直是最刺激的娛樂有沒有！=The dark side of family, the most thrilling entertainment!
這傢伙……在瞎說些什麼啊……=This guy... What the hell is he saying...
如果主演又剛好是有毒父母的倖存者吼，\n到時候在網路上一定超嗨的！=And if the lead actor actually survived toxic parents, it'll be crazy viral online!
就是這麼巧哦，{{A}}剛好把你、\n這個被有毒父母養大的帥～哥介紹給我！=What a coincidence, {{A}} just introduce me to you, a handsome guy raised by toxic parents～!
我？被有毒父母養大的……？=Me? Raised by toxic parents...?
總之就是要先試拍一下啦，\n你要把這周全～部都空出來給我哦？=Anyway, we'll do a test shoot first, so clear your entire week for me, okay～?
總之就是要先試拍一下啦，\n你要把這周全～部都空出來給我哦！=Anyway, we'll do a test shoot first, so clear your entire week for me, okay～?
拍攝地點已經訂好啦！不會很突然吧？\n明天一早我們直接在外景巴士上見囉！=The filming location's already booked! Not too sudden, right? We'll meet tomorrow morning on the location bus!
等、等等！\n也就是說，這一整周{{A}}都不在嗎？=W-Wait! So {{A}} won't be here all week?
那可不好辦=That's a problem
馬上就是學園祭的演出了=<size\=23>The school festival performance is soon</size>
對啊！\n沒有{{A}}，我們怎麼排練啊！=Exactly! Without {{A}}, how can we rehearse!?
……舞臺？{{B}}啊，\n{{A}}現在不是沒有接工作的嘛？=...Stage? {{B}}, \nisn't {{A}} free right now?
他們說的不是工作，是學園祭啦。\n{{A}}沒必要陪他們弄這個。=They're talking about the school festival, not work. {{A}} has far better uses with his time.
YEAH！學園祭！\n超讚的有沒有！青春！告白！篝火晚會！=YEAH! School festival! So awesome! Youth! Confessions! Campfire!
反正定下這邊的工作之後，\n你也沒辦法出演{{A}}的學園祭了。=Once this job is confirmed, you won't have time for {{A}}'s school festival.
我跟你講哦，日程真的超緊超不妙的！\n計畫下個月就得哢嚓——開機囉！=Let me tell you, the schedule is crazy tight! We're scheduled to start filming next month-!
就是說這半年你都得乖乖來全職工作YO！\n其他有的沒的拜託一律取消了啦，YO！=Meaning you'll be working full-time for the next half a year, YO! Please cancel all other nonsense, YO!
半年……恐怕不行！\n接下來還有全戲呢！而且戲劇社那邊也……=Half a year... That's impossible! We have the All-Drama! And the drama club...
{{A}}能更有名的話，對社團也是雙贏吧。\n沒關係啦。=If {{A}} gains proper recognition, it will be a win-win for the club. Don't worry.
而且，你說的全戲是高中的戲劇大賽吧？\n那種活動無所謂啦。=Besides, the All-Drama is just some high school drama competition, right? Who cares about that.
當然有所謂！\n大家都為了比賽在拼命排練……=Of course I care! Everyone's been working so hard for it...
嗯，一群想靠著沾{{A}}的光、\n來贏下比賽的孩子們，真可憐……=Hmph, pitiful children, clinging to {{A}}'s brilliance like insects to light, how pathetic...
但他們要是敢多說什麼，\n我也會讓他們閉嘴的。放心啦。=But if they dare complain, I'll silence them myself. Don't worry.
你們也是哦。=You too.
他的前途不可限量，明白嗎？\n1秒鐘都不能浪費在學園祭這種玩意上呢。=His future is limitless, understand? Can't squander a single second on something as trivial as a school festival.
「這種玩意」……！="Something as trivial"...!
你們和{{A}}，\n根本就是兩個世界的人。=You and {{A}}... \nare from completely different worlds.
你們也算跟他共度了一段青春時光，\n哪怕時間很短，也該知足了吧。=Be grateful you got to spend even a little time with him, that's more than most will ever have.
你這人怎麼說話的！\n拿我們當傻子嗎，混蛋！？=How can you talk like that! You take us for fools, bastard!?
等等，{{A}}，住手！=Wait, {{A}}, stop!
你別攔我，{{A}}！=Don't stop me, {{A}}!
住手，{{A}}。=Stop, {{A}}.
……對不起，{{A}}。\n我拒絕這份工作。=...I'm sorry, {{A}}. I refuse this job.
OH……\n我能問問理由嗎？=OH... Mind telling me why?
這個排程我無法接受。\n因為我還要參加學園祭和全戲。=This schedule doesn't work for me. I still have the school festival and the All-Drama.
等等……！你在說什麼呀，{{A}}！\n高中戲劇和網劇，哪邊更重要你不知道嗎！=Wait...! What are you saying, {{A}}!? Which is more important, some high school play or a web series!
高中戲劇更重要。\n起碼對現在的我來說是這樣。=The high school play is more important. \nAt least, to me right now.
當然，我很感激這份工作邀請。\n不過……=Of course, I'm grateful for the offer. But...
對我來說，\n跟大家共同創造的高中舞臺也很重要。=To me, the stage I create with my friends in high school matters too.
用你的價值觀貶低它，\n是對我和我朋友的侮辱。=Belittling it with your own values is an insult to me and my friends.
還有，{{A}}、{{B}}，\n我要更正一下。=Also, {{A}}, {{B}}, \nI need to correct something.
我的父母才不是有毒父母。\n他們對我這個獨生子非常好，是很優秀的。=My parents are not toxic. They were wonderful to me, their only child.
真的假的～！？=For real～!?
NONONO！\n這跟你講的完全不一樣嘛，{{A}}！=NONONO! This is totally different from what you told me, {{A}}!
不……這是……！=No... That's...!
{{A}}，你醒醒。\n也許你很難承認他們是有毒父母……={{A}}, wake up. Perhaps it's hard for you to admit they were toxic...
但這件事也可以成為你的武器。\n你要把成長的不幸變成機遇！=But you can use that. \nTurn your pain into opportunity!
我會幫你改變的……\n好嗎，{{A}}？=I'll help you through it... Alright, {{A}}?
……我不知道你對我父母了解多少，\n但請不要再用自以為是的猜測來侮辱他們。=...I don't know what you think you know about my parents, but stop insulting them with your assumptions.
啊～懂啦懂啦。整個就是大誤會吧？\n是{{A}}誤會啦對吧？=Ah～ Got it, got it. Just a big misunderstanding, right? {{A}} got it wrong?
不、不是這樣的，{{A}}！=N-no, {{A}}, that's not it!
{{A}}呀～沒有證據就行動，\n可是你的壞習慣YO～？={{A}}～ Acting without evidence is a bad habit of yours, YO～?
那，這件事就當我沒講過啦！=Well, let's just pretend this never happened!
等等……{{A}}！=Wait... {{A}}!
等等，那邊是校舍！\n你去那邊幹什麼啊！=Wait, that's the school building! \nWhere are you going!
不是在準備學園祭嘛？\n我超～想感受一下青春的芬芳呀！=Isn't it the school festival prep? I super want to soak in that youthful energy～!
啊，我會填申請表的啦！\n去哪裡填？教師辦公室？=Ah, I'll fill out the form! Where do I go? \nThe faculty office?

難以置信……\n你知道自己剛才做了什麼嗎，{{A}}？=Unbelievable... Do you realize what you just did, {{A}}?
你把你自己的未來就這麼斷送了啊！=You just threw away your own future!
我很感謝您為我介紹了一份好工作。=I'm grateful you introduced me to a great opportunity.
不過，我的未來由我自己決定。\n你無權對我指手畫腳！=But my future is mine to decide. You don't get to dictate my choices!
……什麼！=...What!
請尊重他的意志=Please respect his will
關你們屁事！！=None of your business!!
{{A}}你……\n你以為，是因為誰你才有現在的人氣？={{A}}, you... Do you even realize who's responsible for your current popularity?
是誰，把你從小舞臺一步步帶到這裡的？=Who dragged you up from those pathetic little stages?
的確是托您的福，我才有如今的人氣。\n但我當初並沒有拜託過您……=I owe my current popularity to you. But I never asked for your help in the first place...
我也同樣可以毀掉你……\n你明白吧？=I can just as easily ruin you... \nYou understand that, right?
不光是你，我也可以讓你父母……\n懂嗎？=And not just you, your parents too... \nGet it?
{{B}}……{{A}}，明白就好。\n我倒要看看你的覺悟如何。={{B}}... {{A}}, you do understand. Let's see how long that resolve of yours lasts.
等你父母被毀掉的時候……\n看你還敢不敢這樣忤逆我。=Once your parents are ruined... \nwe'll see if you still dare to defy me.
{{A}}……我不想說難聽的話。\n你快趁現在向{{B}}道歉。={{A}}... I don't want to say anything harsh. You should apologize to {{B}} right now.
再這樣下去你……不，你父母也是，\n還有跟你相關的人都會遭殃的。=If this keeps up, you... no, your parents and everyone connected to you will suffer.
多此一舉，{{A}}。\n口頭道歉是沒有意義的。=Unnecessary, {{A}}. \nAn empty apology means nothing.
如果真的理解自己的立場，\n{{A}}會知道該怎麼做的……就像你一樣。=If he truly understands his position, \n{{A}} will know what to do.... Just like you.
好了，走吧。\n必須抓緊準備{{A}}父母的資料了呢。=Now, let's go. We have to hurry and gather information on {{A}}'s parents.
沒事吧？{{A}}？=Are you okay, {{A}}?
……要說沒事才是假的啊，哎。=..Honestly? No.
{{A}}沒做錯什麼=<size\=24>{{A}} didn't do anything wrong</size>
都是{{A}}的錯=<size\=29>It's all {{A}}'s fault</size>
怎麼攻擊我都沒關係，\n但是……我父母……=They can attack me all they want, \nbut... my parents...
他們都是在社會上有頭有臉的人，\n如果因為我出了什麼事……=They're respected people in society, if something happens to them because of me...
我真蠢啊……\n我明明知道與她為敵有多可怕。=I'm so stupid... I knew how dangerous it was to oppose her.
可……我就是沒忍住。=But... I just couldn't hold back.
我受不了她看不起高中戲劇……\n受不了她取笑我、戲劇部，還有大家……=I hate how she scoffs at high school theater... mocks me, the drama club, everyone...
我想和你們、這些熱愛表演的人一起……\n一起站在學園祭的舞臺上……！=I wanna stand on that festival stage with you guys... people who burn for acting just like I do...!
唔……剛剛的是……=Hmm... That was...
……總之，我先去跟爸爸打個電話。\n得想想辦法才行……=...Anyway, I need to call my dad first. \nI have to figure something out...
另外……我可能沒辦法在學園祭演出了。\n抱歉啊，明明都一路走過來了。=Also... I might have to drop out of the festival performance. Sorry, even after coming this far.
{{B}}！為什麼啊，{{A}}！={{B}}! Why, {{A}}!
那個人說要毀掉誰，就真的會說到做到。\n無論對方是藝人，還是普通人……=When that woman says she'll ruin someone, she means it. Whether it's a celebrity or an ordinary person...
所以如果我繼續參加，\n你們、還有{{A}}，都會有麻煩的。=So if I keep participating, you, and {{A}}, will be in danger.
不用顧慮我們！=Don't worry about us!
不會造成麻煩的！=No trouble at all!
對啊！\n而且我們可以自己保護自己！=Yeah! And we can protect ourselves!
我們想要跟{{A}}一起演出！=We want to perform with you, {{A}}!
你們能這麼說，我很開心。謝啦。\n不過……=I'm glad you feel that way. Thanks. But...
她不是普通的對手……\n就像{{A}}也不敢跟她作對一樣……=She's not an ordinary enemy... Even {{A}} wouldn't dare oppose her...
話說回來……\n剛才跟{{A}}一起的那位男性……=Speaking of which... That man who was with {{A}} earlier...
他也是{{A}}的朋友嗎？\n好像你還知道他的名字……=Is he also a friend of yours, Ikenami-kun? \nYou seemed to know his name...
嗯，那個人是……以前的熟人。=Yes, that guy is... an old acquaintance.
總之我先給我爸打個電話。\n你們先回體育館吧。=Anyway, I'll call my dad first. \nYou all head back to the gym.
{{A}}要是真的放棄了，\n那可怎麼辦啊……=If {{A}} really gives up, then what are we going to do?
還有他父母的事情。\n{{A}}是在用造謠來威脅他！=And about his parents. \n{{A}} is threatening him with slander!
唔……吾感覺，\n{{A}}剛剛復甦的慾望好像又被奪走了。=Hmm... I sense that {{A}}'s newly awakened desires are being stolen from him again.
現在馬上讓{{A}}改心=<size\=25>Have to change {{A}}'s heart</size>
說服{{A}}不要放棄=<size\=25>Convince {{A}} not to give up</size>

Choice 1
對！這樣一來，\n也不用擔心{{A}}的慾望被繼續奪走了！=Right! That way, {{A}}'s desires won't keep getting stolen!
而且還可以保護{{A}}的家人！=And this can protect {{A}}'s family too!
Choice 2
與其這樣，\n不如現在就去{{B}}，讓{{A}}改心吧！=Rather than waiting, let's head to the {{B}} now and change {{A}}'s heart!
這樣一來，\n我們就可以保護{{A}}和他的家人了！=That way, we can protect {{A}} and his family!
說得對……\n就算有陰影擋住入口，我們也必須前進了。=You're right... Even if the Shadows are blocking the entrance, we have to push forward.
走吧，現在就去{{A}}……=Let's go to {{A}} now...

{{C}}？{{C}}？？{{B}}！？\n等等，誰啊！？是誰點了{{A}}！={{C}}? {{C}}?? {{B}}!? Wait, who!? \nWho started the {{A}}!
喂，吾強調過多少次了！\n禁止從{{A}}站以外的地方潛入啊！=Hey, how many times do I have to say it! No infiltrating from anywhere but {{A}} Station!
r:"^不是我啊！是(.*)嗎！？$"="Wasn't me! Was it $1?"
不是不是=No no
WIND？=Wind?
那，難道說是WIND？=Then, was it Wind?
才不是呢！=No way!
{{B}}？\n那到底是誰點了{{A}}啊？={{B}}? Then who started the {{A}}?
……等等，大家看那邊！=...Wait, everyone, look over there!
{{A}}？怎麼沒有訊號……？={{A}}? Why's there no signal...?
{{A}}……這裡是哪兒……={{A}}... Where is this...
{{A}}……這裡是哪裡……={{A}}... Where is this...
{{A}}，你們是誰啊！？={{A}}, who are you!?
{{C}}、這個聲音是……\n{{B}}和{{A}}？={{C}}, that voice... {{B}} and {{A}}?
r:"^那，難道那邊的是(.*)……？\n然後你是(.*)？$"="Then, that's $1...? And you're $2?"
你們這是穿的什麼啊！？\n也不是演出服吧，到底是……=What are you wearing!? These aren't stage costumes, right? What's going on...
{{A}}，搞不懂，這是怎麼了。\n發生了什麼？還有那邊那個玩偶是誰啊？={{A}}, I don't get it. What's going on? \nAnd who's that mascot?
誰是玩偶啊！你哪怕說{{A}}都比……\n算了，煩死了！=Who are you calling a mascot! Even {{A}} would be... Whatever, I'm so annoyed!
不過為何連{{A}}都會來{{B}}……=But why is {{A}} in the {{B}} too...
那個，該怎麼跟你解釋呢？\n雖然這是機密，但其實我們是…=Um, how to explain this...? \nIt's a secret, but we're actually...
{{B}}……！？\n{{A}}，快來我們身後！={{B}}...!? {{A}}, get behind us, now!
這個大傢伙是什麼東西！？\n到底發生了什麼啊？=What is that thing!? What's happening?!
{{B}}……\n吾等不能邊帶著{{A}}邊戰鬥……！={{B}}... We can't fight and protect {{A}} at the same time...!
{{A}}！？\n這車又是從哪兒冒出來的啊！={{A}}!? Where'd this car even come from!
{{A}}！？\n這車又是從哪裡冒出來的啊！={{A}}!? Where'd this car even come from!
沒時間解釋了，快上車！！=No time, just get in!!
各位，戰略性撤退！\n從這裡先逃出去吧！=Everyone, tactical retreat! Let's escape for now!
車竟然……說話了！？=The car just... talked!?
{{A}}，你現在一定有很多疑問，\n但還請無條件配合我們。={{A}}, I know this makes no sense to you, but just do as we say for now.
請相信我們=Please trust us
一定會保護好你的=I will protect you
sr:"^(.*)……\n好，我知道了。$"="$1... Okay, I understand."
總之我會跟著你們的。\n過後可要好好解釋清楚啊！=I'll follow you. But you owe me an explanation later!

可惡，怎麼甩不掉它……\n再跑快點兒，CATTLE！=Damn it, it's still on us...! Go faster, Cattle!
可惡，怎麼甩不掉它……\n再跑快一點，CATTLE！=Damn it, it's still on us...! Go faster, Cattle!
不用你說吾也知道！\n但人太多了速度上不來……再這樣下去……=I know! I can't speed up with this many people... At this rate...
啊，你們看！\n那邊不就是{{A}}入口嗎？=Ah, look! Isn't that the entrance to {{A}}?
{{A}}的……{{B}}？={{A}}'s... {{B}}?
WONDER，先進{{A}}裡吧！\n那裡一定有能躲的地方！=Wonder, let's enter the {{A}}! \nThere must be a place to hide!
先去{{A}}躲避一下！=Hide in the {{A}}!
吾知道了！\n大家坐好，吾要直接衝進去了！=I got it! Everyone, sit tight, I'm going in!

呼……\n看來{{B}}不會追到{{A}}裡面呢。=Phew... Looks like {{B}} won't follow us into the {{A}}.
不過它的氣息還在附近。\n現在最好不要離開{{A}}區域。=But its presence is still nearby. It would be best to not leave the {{A}} yet.
那個……現在算暫時安全了嗎？\n我想請你們說明一下情況……=So... are we safe for now? \nI would like you to explain...
啊，對啊。\n其實是這樣的……=Ah, right. \nActually...
{{A}}……{{B}}，還有陰影……\n所以，你們現在才穿著{{C}}啊……={{A}}... {{B}}, and Shadow... So that's why you're all in {{C}}...
我覺得你肯定不信吧……=I know it's hard to believe...
不，我相信你們。\n畢竟我能看出來，這可不是特攝什麼的。=No, I believe you. Honestly, it's obvious this isn't some staged production.
所以，你們穿梭在現實與{{A}}之間，\n跟剛才那種怪物戰鬥……=So, you travel between the real world and the {{A}}, fighting those monsters...
沒錯，用這個{{A}}。=Yes, using this {{A}}.
嗯？總覺得見過這個圖示……=Huh? I think I've seen this icon...
對了！剛才我給爸爸打電話，雖然沒打通，\n但好像看到一個陌生的圖示……=Right! Just now, when I couldn't call my dad earlier, I saw this weird icon I didn't recognize...
果然啊……！\n這跟你們的圖示是一樣的吧？=Knew it...! It's the same icon as yours?
{{A}}的手機裡也有導航？={{A}} got the Nav too?
莫非突然來到{{A}}是因為……=<size\=26>We're suddenly in the {{A}} because...</size>
{{C}}還真是！\n{{A}}的手機裡也有{{B}}！={{C}} For real! {{A}}'s phone also have the {{B}}!
那剛才大家突然進入{{A}}……=So maybe the reason we suddenly entered the {{A}} was...
啊，是不是{{A}}不小心點了圖示啊？=Ah, did {{A}} accidentally tapped on the icon?
{{A}}、有嗎……？\n我不記得我點過。={{A}}, did I...? I don't remember.
那麼，{{A}}，接下來要怎麼辦呢？\n如果出去，剛才那傢伙就會追過來吧？=Then, um, what now? If we go back out, that thing will probably chase us?
沒錯，至少在{{B}}的氣息消失之前，\n我們都不能離開{{A}}……=Right. Until the {{B}}'s presence vanishes, \nwe can't leave the {{A}}...
好。那麼……\n看來只能進那棟很顯眼的大樓了吧？=Right. Then... I'm guessing we should enter that flashy building, right?
唔……\n雖然帶著{{A}}探索{{B}}會有風險……=Hmm... Alright bringing {{A}} to {{B}} exploration is risky...
但比起去外面，\n{{A}}裡才有藏身之處呢。=It's safer than being outside, there are hiding spots in the {{A}}.
那些人不人鬼不鬼的傢伙是誰啊……\n而且好像提到了「{{A}}」？=What are those weird looking guys... They kept mentioning "{{A}}"?
啊，抱歉。本來想晚點再跟你解釋的。\n你把這裡當作{{A}}的內心世界吧。=Ah, sorry. I was going to explain this to you later. You can think of this as {{A}}'s inner world.
{{A}}的……內心世界？={{A}}'s... inner world?
沒錯，是以{{A}}扭曲的慾望為核心，\n形成的認知{{C}}……也就是「{{B}}」。=That's right, this is a cognitive place formed with {{A}}'s distorted desires at its core... a "{{B}}".
只要奪走隱藏在這裡的{{B}}，\n我們就能讓{{A}}改心。=By stealing the {{B}} hidden here, we can change {{A}}'s heart.
阿？改、改心……？=Huh? C-Change of heart...?
那個{{A}}，會變成正常人？\n這不可能吧……=That {{A}}, will become a normal person? That's impossible...
你這麼想也不奇怪啦，但實際上，\n我們已經讓前棒球選手{{A}}……=You might think so, but actually, we already did that to the former baseball player {{A}}...
還有{{A}}、{{B}}都改心了哦。=We also made {{A}} and {{B}} have a change of heart.
啊～我記得，\n美食藝人{{A}}在新聞發佈會上大哭……=Ah～ I remember, the gourmet celebrity {{A}} broke down at that press conference...
好像從那時起，就出現了「怪盜」這個詞。\n就是因為你們讓他們改心了吧？=That's when the "Phantom Thieves" rumors started. Was that because you guys changed their hearts?
我們也會讓{{A}}改心的=<size\=26>We will change {{A}}'s heart</size>
難以置信……\n真是完全想像不到。=I can't believe it... \nThere's just no way I can believe that.
嗯，但信不信由你，這是事實。=Hmm, there's no helping it. But whether you believe it or not, that's the truth.
不過，接下來該怎麼辦呢？\n那些傢伙肯定不會讓我們進去的吧？=But, what's next? Those guys are blocking our way again.
而且，上次找到的另一個區域是死路。=However, the other area we explored last time was a dead end.
要是在那裡被襲擊，就真的無處可逃了。\n吾不贊成去那邊。=There is no escape if we get ambushed. I don't agree with going there.
是啊，該怎麼辦呢……=Right, then what should we do...
如果想見{{A}}的話，\n那就變成帥哥後再來吧！=If you want an audience with {{A}}, come back when you're handsome!
現在有帥哥了吧……=<size\=26>There's someone handsome...</size>
{{A}}在的話是不是……={{A}} is here...
啊，你是說如果和{{A}}在一起，\n那些陰影就會讓我們通過？=Ah, you are saying if we go with {{A}}, those Shadows will let us pass?
他確實很帥……\n但這真的行得通嗎？=He's certainly handsome... \nBut will this really work?
唔……從{{B}}現實中的狀態來看，\n她很可能將{{A}}認知為「特殊的存在」……=Hmm... Given {{B}}'s behaviors in reality, it's highly likely she might perceive {{A}} as a "special person"...
不能這麼做。\n不能讓{{A}}去當誘餌。=We can't do this. \nWe can't let {{A}} be the bait.
我不介意。=I don't mind.
雖然我不清楚原委，\n但如果能幫上忙，就讓我去吧。=I may not know the details, \nbut if I can help, let me do it.
我和那些奇怪的人談談就行嗎？=All I have to do is talk to those strange people, right?
跟我們一起吧=Come with us
我們會保護你的=We'll protect you
跟著你們就行，對吧？\n明白，那更沒問題了。=Just follow you guys, right? \nGot it, no problem then.
不過，真進到塔裡的話可能會更危險哦，\n說不定會遇到更強悍的陰影。=But if we really go inside the tower, it might get even more dangerous. We could run into stronger Shadows.
就算這樣也要試試=<size\=30>Even so, we have to try</size>
不想錯失良機=<size\=29>Can't miss the opportunity</size>
還是放棄吧……=Maybe give up...

Choice 1
好，隊長都這麼說了，我也贊成！=Alright, if the leader says so, I agree too!
我來負責保護{{A}}！就交給我吧！=I'll take responsibility for protecting {{A}}! \nLeave it to me!
Choice 2
是啊，不管怎樣，\n不進去怎麼讓{{A}}改心呢？=Yeah, no matter what, how else can we change {{A}}'s heart if we don't go in?
Choice 3
你在怕什麼呀。\n我不都說了沒關係嘛？=What are you afraid of? Didn't I say it's fine?
我相信無論發生什麼，\n你們都會保護我的。=I trust that no matter what happens, you'll all protect me.
喂，我來負責保護{{A}}！就交給我吧！=Hey, I'll take responsibility for protecting {{A}}! Leave it to me!
好吧。吾也聽從隊長的決定。=Alright. I'll follow the leader's decision too.
那走吧！\n如果不讓我們進去，就打倒他們！=Then let's go! If they don't let us in, \nwe'll just take them down!
……哦對了，{{A}}。\n在這裡要叫我SOY啊。=...Oh, right, {{A}}. Here, you have to call me Soy.
我是CLOSER！=I am Closer!
請叫我WIND。=Please call me Wind.
吾是CATTLE。\n這傢伙是WONDER。=I'm Cattle.\nThis guy is Wonder.
我是WONDER，{{A}}=<size\=25>I'm Wonder. {{A}}</size>
很像怪盜吧？=Like Phantom Thieves?
原來如此，在{{A}}要用代號相稱啊。=I see, you use code names in the {{A}}.
Bene。那我和你們一起。\n拜託了，WONDER。=Bene, then I'll join you. Please, Wonder.

Palace 5 Exploration Part 2
----------
這裡只能通往死路。\n還是前往正面的入口吧。=This path only leads to a dead end. Let's head to the main entrance instead.
只能一試了……=Have no choice but to try...
哦呀，那邊的小哥……！=Oh my, that guy over there...!
好棒的帥哥……！\n請進去吧！=What a handsome man...! \nPlease, go right in!
可以進去嗎？\n不會是想趁機偷襲我們吧。=Are we really allowed in? You're not planning to ambush us, are you?
哪裡敢！\n這裡的規定就是要對帥哥畢恭畢敬哦！=How could we dare! The rule here is to treat handsome men with the utmost respect!
那麼，帥哥的各位同伴們也請進吧。=In that case, the handsome one's companions may enter as well.
好厲害，真的給過了啊。=Amazing, they actually let us through.
果然是看「臉」放人啊……=So they really judge people based on "looks"...
這是……{{A}}的認知對吧？\n唔，總覺得好噁心……=This must be... {{A}}'s cognition, right? Ugh, it feels kinda gross...
不過既然達到目的了那就無所謂啦。\n總之我們進去吧。=But since it worked, I guess it doesn't matter. Anyway, let's go in.

{{A}}！\n要去上層就好好排隊啊！={{A}}! If you want to go to the top, just queue up!
{{A}}……抱歉。這是什麼情況？={{A}}... sorry.\nWhat is this situation?
大家都是好不容易才取得了『上去的資格』，\n不要在最後關頭做出格的事呀。=Everyone has finally obtained the "qualifications to go up", don't do anything out of line at the last minute.
上去的資格？=Qualifications to go up?
哦？ 你們不知道嗎？ 想到上層去，\n只有先去『覲見室』取得資格才行哦。=Oh? Didn't you know? To reach the upper level, you must first get the qualifications in the "Audience Chamber".
覲見室……又是什麼？？=Audience Chamber... What's that??
哎呀，原來是一群菜鳥啊。\n那是一個很重要的房間啦！=Oh, it turns out they are a bunch of rookies. That's a very important room!
如果想到上面去，\n就先去那邊取得資格再說吧。=If you want to go to the top, you should first get the qualifications.
看來不會簡單的讓我們通過呢。\n只能去那個『覲見室』一探究竟了。=It looks like they won't let us pass so easily. Let's investigate this "Audience Chamber".
WONDER，在附近找找\n前往深處的路吧。=Wonder, look around for a way to go deeper.

哇……這是哪兒？好震撼啊。\n而且有好多人呢。=Wow... What is this place? It's amazing. \nAnd there are so many people here.
哇……這是哪裡？好震撼啊。\n而且有好多人呢。=Wow... What is this place? It's amazing. \nAnd there are so many people here.
那些不是真正的人，是認知存在。\n可以理解為{{A}}印象中的人。=Those aren't real people, they're cognitive beings. You can think of them as how {{A}} perceives them.
明明之前探索過的區域，\n都是像螞蟻一樣的陰影……=But in the areas we explored before, \nthe Shadows were all like ants...
為什麼這裡有這麼多人型認知存在啊？=Why are there so many humanoid cognitive beings here?
走近看看=Take a closer look
問問他們自己吧=Ask them

Choice 1
嗯，仔細觀察一下他們的行動吧，\n看看到底是基於什麼樣的認知。=Hmm, let's carefully observe their behavior first. We should figure out what kind of cognition they're based on.
Choice 2
唔，想弄懂他們是基於什麼樣的認知，\n確認問本人效率最高……=Well, if we want to understand their cognition, asking them directly would be the most efficient...

但這樣有可能會被{{A}}察覺。\n總之先靠近點看看情況吧。=But that might alert {{A}}. For now, let's just move closer and assess the situation.
有氣無力的認知存在=Weak Cognitive Being
我對不起這個世界，活著我很抱歉……\n我……是個沒有任何價值的人……=I've wronged this world, I'm sorry for being alive... I... am a worthless person...
{{A}}？為什麼要說這種話！？=Huh?! Why would they say such things!?
喂，CLOSER！=Hey, Closer!
啊！=Ah!
抱歉，但這個人……\n看起來也太慘了……=I'm sorry, but this person... \nthey look absolutely miserable...
你不需要同情我……\n我是個色狼，是個無恥的混蛋。=You don't need to pity me... I'm a pervert, a shameless scumbag.
色狼！？=A pervert!?
是的。多虧{{A}}揭露了我的罪，\n我才得以受到社會的制裁……=Yes. Thanks to {{A}} exposing my sins, I was rightfully punished by society...
我已經無法再回到社會……\n我只能一直在這裡懺悔下去……=I can never return to society now... All I can do is stay here and repent forever...
色狼啊……\n那確實不可原諒……=A pervert, huh... Yeah, that's unforgivable...
等一下。\n我好像見過這個人。=Wait. I think I've seen this person before.
我忘了名字，應該是家出版社的副社長。\n好像跟{{A}}是競爭對手吧……=I don't remember his name, but he was a deputy editor at some publishing company. Probably a competitor to {{A}}...
莫非，這是……！=Could it be, this is...!
女性認知存在=Female Cognitive Being
我明明是偶像，卻和經紀人搞婚外情。\n我背叛了我的粉絲……=I was an idol, but I had an affair with my manager. I betrayed my fans...
我們被{{A}}揭發了。\n一切都真相大白了。={{A}} exposed us. \nThe whole truth came to light.
男性認知存在=Male Cognitive Being
我就是那個對她出手的變態經紀人。=I was the disgusting manager who took advantage of her.
我已經不能回歸職場和家庭了……=I can never go back to my job or my family now...
我會在這裡跟她一起不斷反省的……\n十分感謝揭發我們的{{A}}。=I'll stay here and reflect with her forever... I'm so grateful to {{A}} for revealing our sins...
看來這裡的人都是……=So the people here are all...
是被{{A}}寫成報導、爆出醜聞的人，\n所形成的認知存在吧。=These are the cognitive beings formed from people whom {{A}} exposed in scandalous articles.
也就是說，他們都是受害者吧……！=In other words, they're all victims...!
剛才那位女性和經紀人，我有印象呢。=I remember that woman and her manager.
好像就是因為出軌報導，\n那個女孩最後退出了演藝圈。=It's true that she retired from the industry after the affair was reported.
……但在業界，一直有人說那是謠言。=...But in the industry, there were always rumors that it was just fabrication.
謠言！？=Fabrication!?
嗯。她跟經紀人只是正常的工作關係，\n而且自己本來就有男朋友。=Yes. She and her manager were just in a normal professional relationship, and she already had a boyfriend.
但她男朋友……\n似乎是位{{A}}欣賞的歌手……=But her boyfriend... was apparently a singer that {{A}} admired...
{{B}}？\n所以就出於{{A}}陷害了那個偶像！？={{B}}? So she framed that idol out of jealousy!?
好幾個認識她的演員朋友都這麼說。\n雖然也不知道真假……=Several of her actor friends said so. \nThough we can't be sure if it's true...
現在我覺得，\n{{A}}也許真的幹得出來這種事。=At this point, \nI wouldn't put it past {{A}}.
太過分了吧……=That's terrible...
換句話說，這裡的人都是被{{A}}陷害、\n被社會所抹殺的人。=In other words, the people were framed by {{A}} and socially erased.
而且他們嘴裡都是對{{A}}的感恩戴德。\n這意味著……=And yet, they're all spouting gratitude toward {{A}}. That means...
對{{A}}而言「制裁他們」不但理所應當，\n反而認為是「拯救」了他們。=To {{A}}, "punishing them" isn't just justified, she genuinely believes she's "saving" them.
這認知真是扭曲到極限了。\n為了私慾毀掉他人，還認為這是正義……=This cognition is distorted to the extreme. Destroying lives for selfish gain and calling it justice...
不可饒恕……=Unforgivable...
她到底毀了多少人的人生……=How many lives has she ruined...
是啊，這場面的確令人作嘔。\n但吾等必須繼續前進了。=Indeed, this is sickening to witness. \nBut we must press on.

唔……！\n那是……在做什麼？=Hmm…! \nWhat is that... doing?
剛才的那個陰影，\n是怎麼開的門呀？=How did the shadow just now open the door?
應該和牆上的結晶有關。=It should be related to the crystal on the wall.
但和迄今為止遇到的結晶不同，\n似乎沒有辦法移動。=But unlike the crystals encountered so far, it seems that there is no way to move.
嗯……剛才的陰影似乎做了些奇妙的舉動\n把結晶給啟動了……=Hmm... the shadow just now seemed to have done something strange and activated the crystal...
嗯，『{{A}}』地一下那樣……\n要模仿它的動作嗎？=Yes, they did a "{{A}}"... \nWant to imitate its actions?
目前的線索太少了。\n先跟上去看看吧。=There are too few clues at the moment. \nLet's follow and see first.
剛才的陰影應該就在門後！\nWONDER，準備好了嗎？=The shadow just now should be behind the door! Wonder, are you ready?
那些紅兵蟻是在幹什麼……？\n好像在使用什麼武器……=What are those red soldier ants doing...? \nIt seems like they are using some weapon...
你們……是入侵者嗎！？\n抓住他們！=Are you... intruders!?\nCatch them!
幹得不錯，WONDER！=Good job, Wonder!
剛才是怎麼回事？\n那個東西直接進到手槍裡了！？=What happened just now? \nThat thing went straight into the gun!?
嗯……似乎是那種結晶的能量\n被灌注到WONDER的武器裡了……=Hmm... it seems that the energy of the crystals has been infused into Wonder's weapon...
現在是不是\n也可以做到剛才的『那個』了？=Maybe you can do "that" now?
啊，你是指剛才的陰影\n『{{A}}』的那一下吧！=Ah, you mean that “{{A}}”!
這種能量……\n該說是螞蟻的費洛蒙一樣的東西嗎。=This energy... is it something like ant pheromones?
總之，這樣應該就能啟動牆壁上的結晶了。=Anyway, this should be able to activate the crystals on the wall.
成功了！\nWONDER，旁邊還有一個結晶！=Success! Wonder, there is another crystal next to it!
啊……聽到剛才的聲音了嗎？\n可能是哪裡的門開了！=Ah...did you hear that sound just now? \nMaybe a door somewhere is open!
這個辦法果然可行。\n我們回剛才的房間確認一下吧。=This method really works. \nLet's go back to the room and check.
唔……看來沒有子彈了。=Hmm... looks like there's no ammo left.

不錯！獲得貧民窟的全部地圖了！=Nice!\nWe got the full slum map now!
唔啊，感覺要走的路還很長？\n我們是要去哪裡來著？=Hmm, it feels like there is still a long way to go? Where are we going?
現在準備前往的是，\n地圖這裡的『覲見室』。=Now we are going to the "Audience Chamber" here on the map.
到處都有陰影的氣息。\n全員，一邊警戒周圍一邊前進吧。=There are Shadows everywhere. Everyone, move forward while keeping an eye on your surroundings.

好耶！WONDER，門開了哦！=Yay! Wonder, the door is open!
WONDER，前方有強敵的氣息！\n準備好了嗎？=Wonder, there is a presence of a strong enemy ahead! Ready?
那位是……？=That is...?
大膽入侵者，竟敢擅闖禁地！=Bold intruders, you are trespassing!
這傢伙看上去很強啊……！\n好，放馬過來吧！=This guy looks strong...! \nAlright, bring it!

嗯，怎麼了？{{A}}。=Hm, what's wrong? {{A}}.
沒……不會吧。\n可是……=No way... It can't be. But...
等我一下！=Wait!
那個，抱歉打擾一下！=Excuse me, sorry to bother you!
美麗的女性=Beautiful Women
果然是……媽媽！！=It really is... Mom!!
{{B}}那是{{A}}的媽媽！？={{B}} That's {{A}}s mom!?
是媽媽年輕的時候。那時我還小……=Yeah, from when she was younger. \nWhen I was little...
為什麼媽媽會在這種地方……\n而且為什麼穿成這樣子……=Why is mom in a place like this...?\nAnd why is she dressed like that...?
母親的認知存在=Cognitive Mother
請不要管我……讓我一個人待著……=Please... just leave me alone...
我是個不僅出軌、\n還拋棄了孩子和丈夫的惡毒女人……=I'm a vile woman who cheated and abandoned my child and husband...
阿……！？=Huh...!?
{{A}}揭露了我的罪行，\n所以我逃回了自己的國家。={{A}} exposed my sins, \nso I fled back to my home country.
我的丈夫和兒子才終於……\n得以擺脫我這個該死的女人。=Only then could my husband and son... finally be free of a wretch like me.
我對{{A}}感激不盡……=I am very grateful to {{A}}...
你、你在說什麼啊，媽媽！=Wh-what are you saying, mom!
媽媽你沒出軌！\n而且你也沒有拋棄我、沒離開爸爸啊！=You never cheated! And you didn't abandon me or dad either!
不，我就是個不僅出軌、\n還拋棄了丈夫和兒子的惡毒女人……=No, I'm a vile woman who cheated and abandoned my child and husband...
是{{A}}她……\n讓我的家人得到了解脫……=It was {{A}} who... \nfreed them from me...
難道……\n寫當初那篇報導的人就是……！=Don't tell me... The one who wrote that article back then was...!
沒事吧，{{A}}？=Are you okay, {{A}}?

Choice 1
原來……！\n原來是這麼一回事！=I see...! So that's what happened!
Choice 2
啊、嗯……我沒事。\n原來是這樣，原來是這麼回事啊……=Ah... yeah, I'm fine. It all makes sense now...
你明白什麼了，{{A}}？=What did you figure out, {{A}}?
……當初，媽媽是因為一篇醜聞，\n才無法繼續留在日本的。=...Back then, my mom couldn't stay in Japan anymore because of a scandal.
我的父母都是演員，\n他們兩個現在也都還在工作。=Both of my parents are actors, \nthey're still active today.
父親主攻舞臺劇，而母親只演義大利電影。\n所以大家應該不認識……=My dad is mainly on stage and my mom has only appeared in Italian films, so you probably don't know them...
那也就是說，{{A}}是演員世家？\n哇……星二代！=Wait, so {{A}} comes from a family of actors? Wow... a celebrity child!
……沒那麼厲害啦。=...It's not that impressive.
不過，我之所以走演員這條路，\n也是因為父母的影響吧。=But I guess the reason I became an actor was because of them.
小時候，即使只是給我讀繪本，\n他們也會分角色來飾演。=When I was little, even when they just read me picture books, they'd act out the different roles.
最後我也演了起來，一家人一起扮家家酒。\n差不多就是這種家庭環境……=Eventually, I started joining in too. it was like our whole family was playing pretend together...
全家人一起表演嗎……\n好溫馨啊。=A play for the whole family... \nThat sounds so warm.
真是好棒的父母啊！=Your parents are amazing!
嗯，雖然記憶有些模糊……\n但那的確是段很幸福、很快樂的時光。=Yeah, though my memories are a bit fuzzy... \nIt really was a happy, joyful time.
但是有一天……\n一篇報導毀掉了一切。=But one day... \na single article destroyed everything.
日本的醜聞雜誌上，\n刊登了媽媽出軌的文章。=A Japanese scandal magazine published a story claiming my mom was having an affair.
那是一篇完全毫無根據的報導，\n我爸媽都立即否認了。=It was completely baseless, both my parents denied it immediately.
實際上，\n她也只是被拍到和電影製片人吃飯而已。=In reality, she was just photographed having dinner with a film producer.
那不應該立刻就澄清了嗎……？=Shouldn't that have been cleared up instantly...?
那個雜誌就像在追著她咬一樣，\n又接連爆出了更多的醜聞。=But that magazine kept hounding her, publishing more and more fabricated scandals.
說什麼跟年輕演員們偷情、\n拋下兒子在國外過著奢侈的生活……=They claimed she was secretly seeing younger actors, that she abandoned me to live lavishly abroad...
當然，那也全都是謠言。\n只是在國外與年輕演員正常拍攝罷了。=Of course, none of it was true. She was just working on films overseas with those actors.
但俗話說：三人成虎。\n經過媒體的多次報導……人們逐漸相信了。=As the saying goes, no smoke without fire. After many media reports... people bought into it.
另外，我爸爸也是個很受女性歡迎的演員，\n也許這也成了被抨擊的黑點。=Plus, my dad was a popular actor with women, so maybe that made him an easy target too.
其他媒體也都爭相開始報導……\n最終，媽媽在日本的形象完全崩塌了。=Other media followed suit... until mom's reputation in Japan was destroyed.
怎麼這樣……=How...
好過分啊……=That's terrible...
造謠造到這種地步……=To slander this far...
很遺憾，也許這就是人性……\n有名的人越不幸，大眾就越興奮狂熱……=Sadly, maybe that's human nature... The more famous someone is, the more the public enjoys seeing them fall...
人們如果失去正常的判斷能力，\n只會演變成集體正義的徹底失控……=When people stop thinking critically, it just becomes mob justice...
也許……你們是對的。\n當然，那時我爸爸一直在抗議……=Maybe... you're right. Of course, my dad protested at the time too...
最後連他自己都被諷刺成……\n「自欺欺人的傢伙」「綠帽男」……=Even he himself was ridiculed as... "delusional," and "a cuckold"...
好過分……=That's terrible...
結果，媽媽得了心病，回了老家義大利。=In the end, mom's heart grew unwell, and she had to return to her hometown in Italy.
所以你們才分開住了啊……=So that's why you lived apart...
我爸爸也考慮過，\n把他的工作重心轉移到義大利……=My dad considered moving his career to Italy too...
但如果輕率地搬過去的話，\n他反而可能會被進一步被批評成懦夫、逃兵。=But if he did that recklessly, people would've just criticized him as a coward and a deserter.
怎麼會這樣……！=No way...!
雖然記不太清了，\n但我媽媽每天都哭著求我和爸爸……=I don't remember it well, but my mom kept begging me and my dad through tears...
「我無法忍受我愛的人受到傷害，\n希望你們繼續生活在熟悉的日本……」="I cannot bear harm coming to those I love... Please, live on in Japan, your home."
「我一個人離開就可以了。」="I'll be the one to leave."
你媽媽是犧牲了自己，\n努力來保護家人呢……=Your mom sacrificed herself to protect her family...
爸爸也勸過媽媽，但她心意已決……\n說這樣對年幼的我也更好……=Dad tried to talk her out of it, but she refused... saying it would be better for me.
所以從我小時候開始，\n媽媽就一直不在家了。=So ever since I was little, \nmy mom was never home.
{{A}}……還有{{A}}的爸爸媽媽都好可憐。\n明明什麼壞事也沒做……！={{A}}... and your parents have all suffered so much, even though you did nothing wrong...!
{{A}}，的確。\n我小時候還真是挺孤單的。={{A}}, yes. I was pretty lonely as a kid.
不過我們經常電話聯繫，\n每年也能見上兩次面。=But we talked on the phone a lot, and I got to see her twice a year.
對我們家來說，\n應該就這樣也算挺安定的。=For our family, this lifestyle is probably the stable one.
你不想跟爸媽一起住嗎？=<size\=22>Don't you want to live with your parents?</size>
你現在也還會感到孤單吧？=Do you still feel lonely now?
到這個年齡，已經不會啦。\n差不多也該獨自生活了吧？=At this age, not really. It's about time I started living on my own anyway.
而且……我可不想看到我媽媽掉眼淚啊。=And... I couldn't bear to see my mom cry.
她到現在也還會說，\n「沒法陪你一起生活，對不起」呢。=Even now, she still says, "I'm sorry I couldn't be there to raise you".
明明自己才是被傷得最深的受害者……=Even though she was the one who suffered the most...
不過……這是認知存在對吧？\n媽媽會出現在這裡，也就意味著……=But... this is just a cognitive being, right? If mom's appearing here, that means...
寫那篇報導、誣陷我媽媽的人，\n就是{{A}}吧？=The one who wrote that article and framed her, was {{A}}?
肯定是這樣=Definitely
原來{{A}}一家也是受害者=<size\=30>{{A}}'s family is also a victim</size>
……我也是現在才知道。=...I only just realized it now.
那時我還太小了，\n而且爸爸也把當時的報導都扔了。=I was too young back then, and my dad threw out all the articles.
我從來沒有細想過……\n它們到底是誰寫的。=I never really thought about... \nwho wrote it.
唔，而且如果是十幾年前，\n{{A}}可能也還是個默默無聞的小記者。=Hmm, and if it was over a decade ago, {{A}} was probably still an unknown reporter.
從那時起就透過這種手段一路往上爬，\n到現在成了主編……一切都說得通了。=She risen to fame through these methods, and is now the editor-in-chief... It all makes sense now.
雖然我一直在想，\n陷害媽媽的一定是和{{A}}一樣的壞人……=Deep down, I thought the reporter who framed mom was probably the same kind of person as {{A}}...
可誰能想到就是她本人！=But who would've thought it was her herself!
而且，明明就是她害了媽媽，\n還這麼肉麻地挑逗她兒子！？這不正常！=And after what she did to my mom... she had the nerve to flirt with her son!? That's insane!
可惡、可惡啊！！=Damn it, damn it all!!
……你們說過，\n可以讓{{A}}改心對吧？=...You said, it's possible to change {{A}}'s heart, right?
一定要讓她改心=<size\=27>We will change her heart</size>
那能不能也帶我一起。=Then let me come with you.
我想親眼見證，那個女人改心。=I want to see that woman's change of heart with my own eyes.
雖然想帶你一起去……=<size\=30>Although I want to take you...</size>
這有點困難……=This is a bit difficult...
唔，{{A}}裡到處是陰影，十分危險。\n這次也是沒辦法才讓你一起行動的。=Hmm, the {{A}} is filled with dangerous Shadows. We had no choice but to bring you along this time.
而且，如果在這裡丟了性命的話……\n現實世界中的你也會死亡。=And if you die here... you'll die in the real world too.
當然，對吾等也一樣……=Of course, the same goes for us..
但吾等有{{C}}和{{B}}作為保護，\n所以才能對抗{{A}}。=But we have our {{C}} and {{B}} as protection, so we can fight against the {{A}}.
但我們要一邊保護毫無防備的你，\n一邊戰鬥，風險會非常大。=Fighting while also protecting you who are defenseless would be way too risky.
也是啊……抱歉……=Yes... Sorry...
我們一定會讓{{B}}改心的！\n放心交給我們吧，{{A}}！=We'll definitely change {{B}}'s heart! Leave it to us, {{A}}!
嗯，謝謝你們。=Hmm. Thank you.
那這個認知存在的「媽媽」……\n只能讓她繼續在這裡嗎？=Then this cognitive "mom"... \nDo we just leave her here?
對，認知存在跟現實中的人沒有任何關係。\n這只不過是{{A}}心中的樣子罷了。=Yes. Cognitive beings have no connection to real people. This is just how {{A}} perceives her.
吾知道這很難受，但是請你理性看待。=I know it's hard, but please be rational.
好，我知道了。=Okay. I understand.
媽媽，總有一天……\n我絕對會讓{{A}}本人跟你道歉的……=Mom, someday... I'll make {{A}} apologize to you herself...

{{A}}，別擔心！\n我們一定會讓{{B}}改心的！={{A}}, don't worry! We will change {{A}}'s heart!
嗯，謝謝大家。\n抱歉讓你們擔心了……=Thank you, everyone. Sorry I made you worry...

附近都被荊棘給擋住了……！=The area around is blocked by thorns...!
WONDER，找找還有沒有其他的路吧。=Wonder, let's other paths.
這個顏色……和之前的費洛蒙不太一樣呢。=This color... is a bit different from the previous pheromones.
我感受到一股非常不安的氣息……\n不，甚至可以說有點兇暴。=I sensed a very uneasy presence... No, even a bit violent.
嗯……這個顏色的費洛蒙\n也許對荊棘會有效果……=Hmm... pheromones of this color might be effective against thorns...
WONDER，不妨試試看吧！=Wonder, why not give it a try!
好！附近的門全部開啟了！=Yeah! All the nearby doors are open!
看來這種新的費洛蒙\n也能用來啟動結晶。=Seems like this new pheromone can also be used to activate crystals.
大家快看那邊。\n有一處結晶平臺。=Everybody, look over there. \nThere is a crystal platform.
真的{{A}}！　但是不是太窄了？\n而且還有那麼多荊棘……=Really! But isn't that too narrow? And there are so many thorns...
是啊。不過只要把荊棘破壞，\n應該就能利用了。=Yes. But as long as we destroy the thorns, we should be able to use them.
嗯。先用橙色的費洛蒙\n破壞荊棘吧。WONDER，交給你了。=Um. Let's use the orange pheromones to destroy the thorns. Wonder, it's up to you.
唔，不行啊……看來是失敗了。=Hmm, no... It's not working.
WONDER，門後有強大的陰影\n解除螞蟻形態再來吧！=Wonder, there's a powerful Shadow behind the door, remove ant form first!
入侵者，入侵者！=Intruders, intruders!
禁止通行！=No passage!
感覺還有需要調查的地方……=Feels like there's still more to investigate...
前方感知到大量陰影，\n看來那扇門後，就是『覲見室』了。=I sensed a lot of Shadows ahead, the "Audience Chamber" must be behind that door.
嗯……但是那個機關\n需要變成螞蟻才能利用。=Hmm... but we need to transform into ants to use this mechanism.
WONDER，找找看附近有沒有\n可以用來變身的肖像畫吧。=Wonder, look around to see if there's a transformation portrait.
WONDER，保持工蟻形態\n回到剛才的地方吧。=Wonder, stay in ant form and go back to where you were.
啊！下面的結晶\n被費洛蒙能量連接起來了！=Ah! The crystals below are connected!
好，WONDER，前進吧！=Alright, Wonder, let's go!
前面就是『覲見室』了……\nWONDER，準備好了嗎？=The "Audience Chamber" is ahead... \nWonder, are you ready?

----------
Encountered Shadow Shimotsuna
----------
這裡是……？\n和其他地方的氛圍完全不一樣啊……=This is...? The feel is completely different from other areas...
這也太花俏了吧……\n看得我眼睛都要花了。=It's so flashy... My eyes hurt just looking at this.
這也是{{A}}的認知嗎？\n簡直就像……少女動畫的拍攝現場一樣……=Is this {{A}}'s cognition too? It's like... a set from a magical girl anime...
興奮的螞蟻陰影=Excited Ant Shadow
哈……哈……\n您就是{{A}}吧？=Huh... Huh... Are you {{A}}?
這、這些傢伙要幹什麼？=Wh-what do these guys want?
我的確就是{{A}}……=I am indeed {{A}}...
接待的螞蟻陰影=Reception Ant Shadow
哦哦……這張臉果然沒錯！\n{{A}}可是{{B}}欽點的貴賓。=Oooh... That face is unmistakable! {{A}} is a VIP personally selected by {{B}}.
您可不能待在這麼骯髒的樓層。\n請您跟我們去上面的貴賓層！！=You cannot stay in such a filthy lower floor. Please accompany us to the exclusive upper floor!
唔……上層！？=Huh... Upper floor!?
{{A}}的氣息就是從這座塔的上層傳來的。\n這邀請來得正好……！=I sense the {{A}}'s presence from the top of this tower. What a welcome invitation...!
之前，入口的陰影一看到{{A}}，\n就立刻讓我們通行了……=Earlier, the Shadows at the entrance let us through as soon as they saw {{A}}...
現在也是，陰影一認出{{A}}的臉，\n就馬上給予優待。=And now, the moment they recognize his face, they're treating him like royalty.
也就是說……？=That means...?
{{B}}對{{A}}真是相當執著啊。={{B}} is obsessed with {{A}}.
但再一起前進的話，\n{{A}}可能會有危險吧！？=If we keep going, won't {{A}} be in danger!?
但同時也是機會吧？\n讓{{A}}改心的機會。=But isn't this our chance to change {{A}}'s heart.
這樣的話，我還是想接受邀請。\n雖然因為我的拖累會更危險，抱歉……=In that case, I'd still like to accept. Sorry for making things more dangerous by coming along...
拜託你了，WONDER。=Please, Wonder.
我知道了，一起走吧！=Got it, let's go together!
帶我們去貴賓區吧！=<size\=30>Take us to the VIP area!</size>
……啊？只有{{A}}能上去。\n你們不可以。=...Huh? Only {{A}} is allowed. You lot cannot come.
尤其是那兩個女的，和戴兜帽的奇怪生物。\n絕對不會放你們過去的！=Especially those two girls and that hooded creature. No entry!
謔！？\n誰是奇怪生物啊！！=Huh!? What hooded creature!!
哦！？\n誰是奇怪生物啊！！=Huh!? What hooded creature!!
只帶走{{A}}可不行！=Can't just let you take only {{A}}!
沒錯！\n別那麼死板，也招待我們上去啊！=Right! Quit being so rigid, just invite us too!
那就只能來硬的了！\n{{A}}不喜歡的傢伙，是沒有人權的！=Then we'll force you! Those disliked by {{A}} have no rights!

真是的！這些傢伙好煩啊！\n怎麼源源不斷地冒出來啊！=Ugh! These guys are so annoying! \nWhy do they keep popping up?
煩死了，你們快讓開！=So annoying! Get out of our way!
看來真的很想帶{{A}}上去呢。\n不過……我是不會把他交給你們的！=They really want to take {{A}}. \nBut... I won't hand him over!
好～了，我已經錄音了哦～<sprite\=1 tint\=1>=Got it～ I've got it all recorded～<sprite\=1 tint\=1>
什麼……！？=What...!?
CLOSER！？WIND！？=Closer!? Wind!?
等等、啥情況！？=Wait, what's happening!?
動、動不了……！\n我們這是怎麼了！？=C-can't move...! What happened to us!?
你們變成雜誌了……=<size\=27>You've become magazines...</size>
你們上雜誌封面了……=You're on the cover...

Choice 1
雜誌！？這這這、這是怎麼回事！？=Magazines!? Wh-what's going on!?
Choice 2
上封面了！？你在說什麼？\n怎麼回事啊！？=On the cover!? What are you talking about? What's going on!?
{{A}}！\n要是被我抓住說話的把柄，你們就完囉～！={{A}}! Once I've got you on record, you're finished～!
{{B}}，{{A}}你真是的……={{B}}, oh {{A}}...
為了見我竟然跑來這種地方啊……\n討厭～<sprite\=1 tint\=1>真是拿你沒辦法啦。=To think you'd come all this way just to see me... Ara～<sprite\=1 tint\=1> You're hopeless.
這個閃瞎眼的傢伙是誰啊……！=Who is this walking eyesore...!
這個聲音，難道是……\n{{A}}？=That voice, could it be... {{A}}?
討厭了啦，除了我還有誰呀？\n沒錯，我就是{{A}}……=Oh please, who else would it be? That's right, I'm {{A}}...
是你的「{{A}}」哦。=Your "{{A}}".
{{A}}！好噁心！！={{A}}! That's disgusting!!
那個樣子，和扭曲的程度……\n看來就是{{A}}了……！=That appearance... that level of distortion... This must be {{A}}...!
是你把我們變成這樣的？\n快點讓我們變回去！=You're the one who turned us into this? Turn us back, now!
哎呀哎呀，\n真是一群又菜又愛叫的小狗呢。=Ara ara, what a bunch of yappy little mutts.
越是口出狂言，對自己不利的黑料就越多，\n難道你們不明白嗎？=The more you bark, the more dirt I get on you. Don't you know how this works?
狂言？=Bark?
黑料？=Dirt?
「煩死了，你們快讓開！」="So annoying! Get out of our way!"
「我是不會把他交給你們的！」="I won't hand him over!"
這就是你們口出狂言的證據哦，\n暴力女和跟蹤狂。=Here's the undeniable proof, violent brute and delusional stalker.
跟蹤狂……我……？=Stalker... Me...?
{{A}}才不是！\n你這純屬找碴啊！={{A}} No way! You're just making things up!
真～可～惜～有錄音為證呢。\n不管你怎麼解釋，也沒有人會信啦。=Too～ Bad～ I've got it all recorded. No matter how you explain it, no one will believe you.
已經不可能再有反轉了。\n你們就乖乖地等著迎接社會性死亡吧！=There's no coming back from this. Just sit tight and wait for your social execution!
吾明白了！原來是這麼回事……！=I see now! So that's how it works...!
現實裡的{{A}}，\n利用捕風捉影的證據來歪曲事實……=The real {{A}} twists the truth using half-baked evidence...
以此毀掉了那些阻礙她的藝人，\n或者其他有社會地位的人……=To ruin anyone who stands in her way, celebrities, public figures...
這些都知道了！長話短說！=We know that! Get to the point!
你們想想，吾等不也親眼見過……\n她拿錄音筆威脅別人的樣子嗎？=Do you remember... We've seen her threaten people with that voice recorder before!
啊……這麼說起來的確……！=Ah... Now that you mention it...!
她那個超級花俏的東西，\n就是錄音筆啊！？=That gaudy thing she's holding, that's her voice recorder!?
她已經利用錄音，陷害了很多人了。=She's already framed so many people with her recordings.
以成功經歷為後盾的絕對自信……=Her unshakable confidence, backed by her success...
只要錄了音，對方就是手心裡的玩物……\n這種認知影響了整座{{A}}！=Once she's got you on tape, you're hers... That cognition has shaped this entire {{A}}!
也、也就是說……\n什麼意思嘛……！=S-So... what does that mean...!
還不懂嗎！就是只要在她面前說錯話，\n就會像那樣被變成雜誌……！=Don't you get it! If you say the wrong thing in front of her, you'll get turned into a magazine...!
只是說個話就！？\n啥呀！這已經算開掛了吧！=Just from talkin'!? That's cheatin'!
別隨便說話=Don't speak
別出聲=Stay silent
來吧，{{A}}！我已經搞定了礙事的女人。\n快來我身邊！=Now, {{A}}! I've taken care of those pesky girls. Come to me!
我、我拒絕……！=I... I refuse!
回答錯誤～\n該說「好的，我很樂意，{{A}}」哦。=Wrong answer～ The correct response is "Yes, I'd love to, {{A}}".
超可愛的{{A}}<sprite\=1 tint\=1>\n我會永～～～遠養、著、你哦！=My adorable {{A}}<sprite\=1 tint\=1> I will keep you... forever～～～!
……你們算什麼東西！？\n太礙事了！給我讓開！=...What insignificant pests!? Out of my sight! Now!

Shadow Shimotsuna Boss 1

大家小心！\n就像剛才CATTLE說的那樣……=Everyone, be careful! Like Cattle said earlier...
如果說錯話被她錄下來，\n就會被變成雜誌、無法動彈了！=If she records you misspeaking, you'll get turned into a helpless magazine!
如果我們全都變成雜誌就完了。\n總之要注意言辭！明白了嗎？=If we all get turned into magazines, it's over. Anyway, be careful with your words! Got it?
{{A}}～我明明也沒說錯什麼啊……！={{A}}～ I didn't even say anything wrong...!
抱歉，我沒法幫上忙了！\n大家要加油啊！=Sorry, I can't help anymore! \nHang in there, everyone!
要說幾、次、啊！\n你太吵了，臭女人！！=How many times do I have to say it! \nYou're too loud, you hag!!
呀啊！？=Ah!?
CLOSER！=Closer!
你幹什麼！=What are you doing!
從被我抓到尾巴寫成報導的一刻起，\n你們就已經完蛋了！=From the moment I caught you, you're finished!
不准再違抗我！只能奉承我、討好我，\n在我的憐憫下悲慘地生活！=No more defiance! You'll praise and obey me, live miserably under my mercy!
你的謠言毀掉了多少人的人生！\n到底是有多麼{{A}}才做得出來……！=How many lives have you ruined with your lies! Just how prideful can you be...!
{{A}}～？\n{{B}}，不對哦，我這才不是{{A}}。=Prideful～？{{B}}, wrong, this isn't pride.
這是我被賦予的權力！\n任何事、任何人，我都能隨意玩弄！！=This power was bestowed upon me! \nI can twist anything, crush anyone!!
呀啊！=Ah!
住手！你這個臭老太婆……=Stop! You damn...
SOY！=Soy!
你剛才想說什麼呢，小夥子～？\n要注意言辭哦？=What were you about to say, boy～? \nBetter choose your words carefully.
不過啊，你們幾個看起來底子也不錯呢～\n我不會毀掉你們的，而是慢慢養～起～來哦<sprite\=1 tint\=1>=But you know, you do have potential～ \nI won't ruin you, I'll raise you instead～<sprite\=1 tint\=1>
要是把你們變成薄～薄的雜誌，\n這麼美好的肉體可就浪費了呢？=Turning you into flimsy～ magazines, would be such a waste of these fine bodies, no?
只不過，在開始飼養之前……\n得讓你們知道誰才是{{A}}！！=But before I tame you... \nYou'll learn who's the {{A}}!

來吧，都過來！讓這些傢伙跪下吧！=Come, all of you! Make these fools kneel!
{{B}}……等著吧，{{A}}～。你很快就是我的東西了～={{B}}... Just wait, {{A}}～\nYou'll be mine soon enough～
休想！絕對不會讓你帶走{{A}}的！=Forget it! I won't let you take {{A}}!
是先消滅手下，還是直接攻擊{{A}}……就交給隊長判斷了！=Should we take out the minions first, or go straight for {{A}}...? Leader, your call!
{{B}}！這是來自大人的愛意！{{A}}萬歲！！={{B}}! This is true affection from Her Majesty! All hail {{A}}!
就是這樣，把這些傢伙大卸八塊吧！{{A}}！=That's right! Tear these brats to pieces! {{A}}!
有意思，我看你們還能反抗到什麼時候！=Amusing, let's see how long you can keep resisting!
這些小鬼……真是夠煩人的！=These damn kids... \nWhat a nuisance!
真是囂張……先從那個傢伙開始收拾！=How insolent... Start by crushing that one first!
唔……她好像鎖定了一個人作為目標。要小心應對！=Hmm... She seems to be singling out a target. Stay sharp!
{{A}}，廢物！都是一群沒用的廢物……！\n喂，還有沒有人啊！？={{A}}, useless! Absolutely useless...! \nHey, is there anyone else!?
看來她已經召喚不出手下了。\n趁現在打倒她！=Looks like she ran out of minions to summon. \nNow's our chance, take her down!

可惡……那傢伙好厲害……！=Damn it... They are strong...!
唔，沒有CLOSER和WIND，\n要對付她還真難……！=Yes, without Closer and Wind, she is tough...!
而且不知道為何，\n那傢伙還沒對吾等使用那個魔杖。=And for some reason, she hasn't used that wand on us yet.
明明隨時都能把吾等變成雜誌……\n這對她來說是綽綽有餘的吧。=She could turn us into magazines anytime... She's just toying with us.
可惡！這下真是糟透了……=Damn! This is bad...
必須跟她拼到底=<size\=28>Fight her to the bitter end</size>
放棄的話一切都完了=It's over if we give up
你真不錯呢……\n那種絕不屈服的鬥志，讓我好喜歡……=You're interesting... \nThat unyielding spirit, I like it...
要不你跟{{A}}一起穿上成對的衣服，\n然後讓我好好疼愛你們倆吧～<sprite\=1 tint\=1>=How about you and {{A}} wear matching outfits, I'll take good care of you both～<sprite\=1 tint\=1>
我只是{{A}}的配菜嗎？=I'm just {{A}}'s side dish?

Choice 1
你問我為什麼……\n{{A}}，當然是因為他對我很重要啊。=Why, you ask...? {{A}}, because he's special, of course.
Choice 2
哎呀呀，這就開始吃醋了？\n不過抱歉哦，他可是特別的存在。=Ara ara, getting jealous? Sorry, but he's special.
{{A}}可是「從鑽石中誕生的原石」……\n是顆一定會閃閃發光的寶石呢。={{A}} is "a rough in the diamond"... \nA jewel predestined to dazzle.
他可是在很～～早以前就註定屬於我，\n是超級可愛的寶貝鑽石呢！=He was always meant to be mine～～ \nMy precious, precious diamond!
從鑽石中誕生的原石……？\n這完全說反了吧！=A rough in the diamond...? \nThat's completely backwards!
你們才不會明白呢。\n唔呼呼呼呼<sprite\=1 tint\=1>=You'd never understand. Muhahaha<sprite\=1 tint\=1>
就算你們再可愛，要是打擾到{{A}}和我，\n也會被馬上甩掉哦。=No matter how cute you are, if you get between me and {{A}}, I'll dump you.
差不多了，隨便找些黑料，\n把你們也都寫成報導吧！=Enough. I'll simply unearth some dirt and have you all splashed across the headlines.
糟糕！她準備使用那個能力了！\n大家注意！=Crap! She's about to use that power! \nEveryone, watch out!
掙扎也沒用的！\n無論你們說什麼我都可以寫成黑料喲～！=Struggling is useless! I can twist whatever you say into scandal!～!
住手！！=Stop!!
請住手吧，{{A}}……=Please stop, {{A}}...
你的目的是我吧？\n只要我成為你的東西，你就滿足了對吧？=You want me, right? If I become yours, \nwill that satisfy you?
我明白的……這樣的話……=I understand... In that case...
我會成為你的寵物狗，或者任何東西！=I'll be your dog, your anything!
所以……\n請把CLOSER和WIND變回來吧！=So... please turn Closer and Wind back!
你別亂說話，{{A}}！=Don't say that, {{A}}!
你知道被關押在這座{{A}}裡……\n意味著什麼嗎！=Do you realize what being trapped in this {{A}} means!
你的餘生都將被困在{{A}}，\n再也無法回到現實，等於死掉了啊！=You'll be trapped in the {{A}} for the rest of your life, never returning to reality! It's as good as death!
你們不也一樣嗎？難道想變成雜誌……\n一輩子在這裡受折磨嗎？=And what about you!? You want to be turned into a magazine... tortured for eternity?
我已經……無所謂了。\n犧牲我1個就能救你們，已經很划算了。=I... don't care anymore. If sacrificing me saves you all, it's worth it.
別放棄自己！=Don't give up yourself!
{{A}}……\n我可以把一生都獻給你，但我有個請求。={{A}}... I'll give you my entire life, \nbut I have one request.
哎呀～當然可以，{{A}}！\n你可以盡情向我撒嬌哦！=Ara～ Of course, {{A}}! \nYou can beg me for anything!
希望你能保證……不要對我父母出手。=Promise me... you'll never touch my parents.
你能發誓，\n今後不會再做出傷害我爸媽的事嗎？=Can you swear you'll never hurt them again?
哈～～～？=Hah～～～?
哈？哈？？哈？？？\n你還把那個女人當寶啊！？=Hah? Hah?? HAH??? \nYou still care about that woman!?
那個欺騙、拋棄了你跟你爸的臭女人！\n你還這麼看重她！哈！？=That cheating, child-abandoning whore! \nAnd you defend her!? HAH!?
那不是……你寫的假新聞嘛！\n我媽媽根本沒有背叛過我們！=That was... your fake news! \nMy mom never betrayed us!
背叛了啊～！我寫的都是真的！\n那女的就是出軌丈夫、拋棄孩子的賤人！=She did～! Every word I wrote was fact! That wretched woman cheated on her husband and abandoned her child!
不是的！=No!
你肯定不知道，\n我媽媽一直都在跟我道歉……=You don't know... \nMy mom kept apologized to me...
她說：「因為我不夠堅強，\n沒辦法陪在你身邊，對不起……」=She said "I'm sorry... I wasn't strong enough, \nI couldn't be there for you..."
她總是、總是流著眼淚對我道歉……\n說讓我這麼孤獨都是她的錯……！=She cried... saying it was her fault I was lonely...!
我爸爸也是！\n即使被嘲笑成分居夫妻、沒人要的丈夫……=And my dad! Even when people mocked him... Called him a cuckold, a loser...
他也一直愛著媽媽、一直支持她。=He never stopped loving her, never stopped supporting her.
他們彼此相愛、彼此信任……\n我也愛著他們，也相信他們！=They love each other, trust each other... And I love them and believe in them!
啊——哈、哈、哈！=A- HAHAHA!
你還真是天真啊，{{A}}。\n果然還是個孩子呢，竟然被這種演技騙了！=You're so naive, {{A}}. \nStill a child, falling for acting!
你說什麼！？=What!?
你聽好了哦，那個女人順利地逃回義大利，\n然後一直過著光鮮亮麗的明星生活。=Listen close. That woman ran back to Italy and lived lavishly as a star.
而你跟你爸卻被遺棄在了日本，\n這是不爭的事實吧！=While you and your dad rotted in Japan! \nThis is an indisputable truth!
我都說過了，那是……！=I told you, that's...!
我再問你，自從你們分開以後，\n那個女人回國了幾次？=Tell me, since she left, \nhow many times has she visited you?
頂多每年回來1次吧？\n但你們可沒少去義大利吧？=Once a year? But you've been to Italy quite a lot, haven't you?
你怎麼連這些事情都……=How do you even...
我當然知道。\n關於你們一家，我什～麼都知道呢！=Of course I know. \nI know everything about your family～!
你說，如果你媽媽真的愛你……\n怎麼會不多來見見你？=If she loved you... \nwhy wouldn't she see you more?
那是因為……\n她一回來，媒體就會撲上來……=That's because... the media would swarm her...
可即使那樣也要見自己的兒子，\n這才是真正的母愛吧！=A real mother would fight to see her son, \nthat's mother's love!
{{A}}，她倒是爽啦！\n自己在義大利過著輕鬆愉快的單身生活！={{A}}, she enjoyed it! Living free in Italy!
然後對很～偶爾才見一面的兒子，\n只要擠幾滴眼淚就能騙得團團轉！=Even though she barely sees you, she fooled you with just a few tears!
不是！媽媽才、才不是那樣……=No! Mom is not like that...
就、是、那、樣、的！！\n你忘了嗎？那個女人可是演員啊，演員！=She, is, like, that!! Or did you forget? \nShe's an actress, actress!
哭戲什麼的可是基本功哦。\n在你面前流的眼淚……全部都是演技呢！=Crying on cue is basic. Those tears... all acting!
你真的好可憐啊，{{A}}。\n你對那個女人來說，只不過是負擔罷了。=Poor {{A}}. To her, you're just baggage.
不是的！我……！=No! I...!
哈……真拿你沒辦法。\n那就讓你親耳聽一聽，真實的證言吧……=Sigh... Fine. I'll let you hear the truth...
……從她本人口中！=...From her own mouth!
媽媽！=Mom!
來，你跟他說。\n親口把真相說出來！=Go on, tell him. Tell him the truth!
我……背叛了丈夫，拋棄了兒子……=I... betrayed my husband, \nabandoned my son...
為什麼？\n因為你兒子對你來說是個負擔吧！？=Why? Because he was a burden, right!?
是的，是個負擔。\n養孩子太無聊了，我還想多跟男人玩玩。=Yes, a burden. Children are boring, \nI wanted to play with men.
在日本有個丈夫，又在義大利享受單身，\n真是太美好了。=It's wonderful to have a husband in Japan and enjoy single life in Italy.
別聽她瞎說！=Don't listen to her!
那只是認知存在！=<size\=26>That's just a cognitive being!</size>
沒錯，那不是你真正的母親！\n不要被迷惑了！=Right, that's not your real mother! \nDon't fall for it!
為了騙過丈夫，我只能偶爾去去日本，\n在孩子面前假裝掉幾滴眼淚……=To deceive my husband, I only went to Japan occasionally, forcing out a few tears in front of my child...
其實我真的覺得很麻煩。\n早知道不生孩子了，根本就是個累贅。=I regret having him. He was just in the way.
呐，{{A}}。\n你肯定也覺得，父母什麼的無所謂吧？=Hey, {{A}}. You don't care about us, don't you?
畢竟分開生活10多年了你也沒抱怨過，\n已經完全習慣了呢。=After all, you never complained in ten years, \nyou've completely adapted by now.
我們其實根本就不需要家人，對吧？=We don't need family, right?
媽……媽……！=M... Mom...!
你現在明白了吧？我說的都是對的。\n剛才那些就是那個賤人的心裡話哦。=Now you understand? I was right. \nThose were her true feelings.
才不是！\n是你故意讓她這麼說的吧！=No! You made her say that!
你其實心裡是知道的吧，{{A}}？\n只不過是在自己騙自己吧？=You knew, didn't you, {{A}}? \nYou were lying to yourself!
夫妻分居兩地還能相親相愛？還愛著孩子？\n全～部都是大大的謊言！=How can a couple still love each other when living apart? Still care for their child? It's all lies～!
不是……謊言……！=Not... lies...!
我懂的哦，{{A}}。\n我知道你一～直都在撒謊呢。=I understand, {{A}}. \nI know you've been lying～
戴著笑臉一樣的面具，對誰都是笑眯眯的，\n但也對誰～都不說心裡話！=Wearing that smiling mask, \nbut hiding everything～!
你和那個女的一樣，都是騙子！\n{{A}}，你們家除了騙子還是騙子！=Like mother, like child, both frauds! \n{{A}}, lying runs in your family!
小時候的{{A}}=Little {{A}}
媽媽……你又要走了嗎？=Mamma... are you leaving again?
{{A}}的母親={{A}}'s Mother
對不起啊，{{A}}……=Sorry, {{A}}...
為什麼我不能跟媽媽一起住啊？=Why can't I live with you, mamma?
對不起……對不起，{{A}}……=Sorry... I'm sorry, {{A}}...
全都是媽媽不好……\n都怪媽媽太軟弱，受不了那些非議……=It's mamma's fault... \nMamma's weak..
{{B}}……都怪我，我這種人……\n讓他跟{{A}}吃了這麼多苦……={{B}}... It's all my fault, \nI made him and {{A}} suffer...
媽媽！媽媽，你別哭！\n對不起，媽媽！=Mamma! Mamma, don't cry! Sorry, mamma!
我沒事的！\n即使分開我也沒事的！所以你別哭，媽媽！=I'm fine! Even if we're apart, I'm fine! \nSo don't cry, mamma!
{{A}}的父親={{A}}'s Father
你不能讓媽媽難過哦，{{A}}。\n因為最痛苦的就是她啊。=You can't make mom sad, {{A}}. \nShe's hurting the most.
嗯……媽媽她哭了……=Hm... Mamma cried...
你一哭媽媽就會更難過了。=If you cry, she'll cry more.
所以你要在媽媽面前保持微笑哦。\n好不好？{{A}}。=So you have to smile in front of her, okay? {{A}}.
……爸爸你呢？\n跟媽媽分開，不孤單嗎？=...Papa, are you really okay? \nYou're not lonely without mamma?
我當然孤單啦！\n但是爸爸可是……有名的演員哦！=Of course I am! \nBut papa... is a famous actor!
表演笑容那可是小菜一碟！\n你聽好哦，在表演笑的時候啊……=Faking smiles is easy! \nWhen you act a smile...
（這樣啊……因為爸爸是演員，\n所以在媽媽面前才能不哭啊。）=(...I see. Because papa is an actor... he can pretend not to cry in front of mamma.)
（那我也要用「演技」好好地笑，\n這樣媽媽也一定會對我笑的……）=(Then I'll "act" too... If I smile hard enough, mamma will smile back.)
住在附近的主婦=Neighbor Housewife
旁邊剛搬來的{{A}}家，就是那家人吧？\n太太是那個義大利有名女演員……=That's the {{A}} family, right? \nThe wife's that Italian actress...
喜歡八卦的主婦=Gossip-Loving Housewife
對對！而且真的是婚後分居哦！\n好像是妻子出軌了吧？=Yeah! And they're separated! \nHeard she cheated!
快點離婚不就好了嘛。\n這樣孩子多可憐啊。=Just divorce already. Poor kid.
你別說，他家孩子好像也有問題哦？\n好像是在學校打了其他孩子什麼的……=The kid's weird too. \nHe hit another kid at school...
你別說，他家孩子好像也有問題哦！\n好像是在學校打了其他孩子什麼的……=The kid's weird too. \nHe hit another kid at school...
說是因為別人先罵他媽媽……\n但那不是很正常嗎，肯定會被人說的嘛。=Heard it was because someone scolded his mom... but isn't that normal? People will definitely talk about it.
有其母必有其子吧？\n哎呀，爸爸估計也不是什麼好人。=Like mother, like son. \nThe dad's probably no better.
（……如果我闖了禍，\n媽媽和爸爸就會被人說壞話。）=(...If I cause trouble, people will insult mamma and papa.)
（看來我不能生氣。即使被欺負，\n也必須裝作沒事才行……）=(I can't get angry. Even if bullied, \nI have to pretend it's fine...)
（我要一直笑，給自己戴上面具。\n要繼續「撒謊」才行，不能傷害別人……）=(It's fine to always smile, let's put on a mask. If I keep "lying", no one gets hurt...)
演出的時候真的很輕鬆。\n因為演戲不算「撒謊」啊。=Acting is easy. Because it's not really "lying".
「來，讓我看看你真正的想法……\n你誠實的內心吧！」="Come, let me see your true thoughts... \nyour honest heart!"
如果讓別人知道了我的真心，\n就一定會受到傷害……=But if people knew my true feelings, they'd get hurt...
比起「誠實」，不如徹底貫徹「謊言」，這樣才不會傷害別人。=Rather than "honesty", it's better to fully embrace "lies", that way no one gets hurt.
我已經不需要真正的自己了。想要「誠實」地活下去的意志……=I don't need my true self. The will to live with "honesty"...
把它從心中扔掉吧。=Throw it all away.
沒錯……你說得對……=Right... You are right...
我一直……都在撒謊。\n無論對父母，還是對朋友、夥伴……=I've always... been lying. To my parents, my friends, everyone...
什麼真心、誠實、真實，統統沒有。\n我是個……渾身都是謊言的人……！=There is no sincerity, honesty or truth at all. I am... a person who is full of lies...!
沒——錯！\n你這不是醒悟了嘛，{{A}}！=Exactly-! So you finally understand, {{A}}.
你嘴裡的什麼「幸福家庭」就是謊言！\n你跟那個臭女人一樣，都是大騙子！=Your so called "happy family" was fake! \nYou're a liar, just like your mother!
趕快，現在就把那個賤人忘掉吧！=Forget that whore, now!
不管你是多大的騙子……\n我都會好好地、精心地呵護你哦……=No matter how much you lie... I'll cherish you...
閉嘴！=Shut up!
才不是謊言！=It's not a lie!
……哈！？=...Huh!?
沒錯！\n你給我閉嘴，臭老太婆！=Yeah! I said shut up, you old hag!
你根本就不懂{{A}}！=You don't know {{A}}!
我們早就從{{A}}那裡聽過這些了！\n他說過，在別人面前說不出心裡話！=He told us everything! How he couldn't speak his mind!
你懂這有多痛苦嗎！？\n為了不讓爸媽傷心，從小就這麼懂事……=Do you know how painful this is!? He's spent his whole life trying not to hurt his parents...
這早就不算「謊言」了！\n這才是{{A}}「誠實」活著的證明！！=That's no "lie"! It's proof {{A}} truly lived with "honesty"!!
你……=You...
呐，{{A}}，你還記得在{{B}}時……\n你跟我們說過的話吧？=Hey, {{A}}, you remember what you told us back in {{B}}... right?
那個時候，\n你不就對我們說了最真心的話嘛！=Didn't you tell us the truth back then!
那些話不是「演技」=Those weren't "acting"
那些話不是「謊言」=Those weren't "lies"

Choice 1
沒錯！你吃著{{A}}的拉麵，喊著好吃！\n然後大家聊得很開心……=That's right! You ate {{A}}'s ramen and said it was delicious! We all had such a great time together...
Choice 2
沒錯！我們3個一起吃到撐，\n然後聊了好多傻乎乎的話題……=That's right! The three of us stuffed ourselves silly, and talked about all kinds of dumb...
那些才不是演技對吧！\n那就是真正的你，不是嗎，{{A}}！？=That wasn't acting, was it! That was the real you, wasn't it, {{A}}!?
真正的……我……=The... real me...
不要聽{{B}}的話，{{A}}。\n那個母親是認知存在，只是唬人的罷了！=Don't listen to {{B}}, {{A}}! That mother is just a cognitive being, it's just an illusion!
煩死了……！=So annoying...!
{{A}}夠了！\n吵死了，你們都給我閉嘴！！={{A}}! Enough, shut your mouths!!
「你給我閉嘴，臭老太婆！」="I said shut up, you old hag!"
「只是唬人的罷了！」="It's just an illusion!"
好了，\n我已經拿到你們暴言的證據了～=Got it, now I've got proof of your violent threats～
糟了……！=Crap...!
SOY！=Soy!
CATTLE！=Cattle!
{{A}}！\n下一個輪到你了哦！={{A}}! \nYou're next!
不可原諒……=Unforgivable...
絕不會把{{A}}給你的=<size\=29>I'll never give you {{A}}</size>
好了～我錄下你那句話了哦～！！\n來，把你也……=Oh～ I recorded that too～!! \nNow, let's turn you into...
夠了！=Enough!
住手吧……\n夠了，已經夠了，WONDER。=Stop... Enough, that's enough, Wonder.
我爸媽都不愛我……我其實都明白。=My parents never loved me... \nI've known it all along.
全部都是「謊言」。無論家人還是自己，\n全部，都只是謊言罷了……=It was all a "lie". My family or myself, \nall of it, nothing but lies...
{{A}}！沒錯沒錯！\n來，你也快說幾句！={{A}}! Yes, yes! \nGo on, say it!
我……一直以來都在欺騙我兒子。\n我們都一樣吧，{{A}}？=I... lied to my son. \nWe're the same, {{A}}.
是啊，媽媽……=Yes, mom...
喂！等等啊，{{A}}！\n都說了那個只是你老媽的認知存在啊！=Hey! Wait, {{A}}! Told you that's just your mom's cognitive being!
那叫家人間的互相體諒，不是撒謊！\n你不是說過嗎，正是因為愛所以……=That's called caring for family, not lying! Didn't you say it yourself, because you love...
謝謝你，SOY……\n但是我家跟你家不一樣。=Thank you, Soy... \nBut my family isn't like yours.
媽媽……實際上我也……\n我也覺得，你哭哭啼啼的真的很煩。=Mom... honestly, I... I hated your crying too, \nit was annoying.
你別這麼說……=Don't say that...
啊——{{B}}！\n太棒了！棒極了，{{A}}！=Ah- {{B}}! Perfect! Wonderful, {{A}}!
別過去！=Don't go!
抱歉啊，WONDER。=Sorry, Wonder.
{{A}}，即使我是這樣的人……\n你也不會嫌棄的，對吧？={{A}}, even if I'm like this... \nYou'll still want me, right?
對、對！讓我好好疼愛你吧！\n我會一～直一～直養著你的哦！=Y-Yes! Let me love you! \nI'll cherish you forever～!
來，對著這裡發誓吧，我要錄下來！\n我要給這一刻留下證明！=Now, swear it! I'll record this moment!
你發誓，從今天起就是我的人了！\n你發誓，要成為我最棒的乖狗狗！=Swear you'll be mine! \nSwear you'll be my perfect little dog!
好，我在此發誓……=Alright, I swear...
我發誓——\n會從你那裡奪回一切！！=I swear-\nI'll take everything back from you!!
WONDER！=Wonder!
原來如此……！=I see...!
我們……變回來了……！=We're... back to normal...!
你你你、你幹什麼啊！\n我的魔法錄音筆！！=Wh-Wh-What are you doing! \nMy magic voice recorder!!
{{A}}，你！={{A}}, you!
笨～蛋。=Fool～
你你你……\n你竟然騙我{{A}}！！={{A}}... \nY-Y-You lied to me!!
我本來就是個騙子啊？\n這不你說的嘛。=I am a liar, right? \nYou said so.
被演員的眼淚騙得團團轉，\n看來你不適合在娛樂圈混哦？=If you fell for an actor's tears, \nmaybe you're not cut out for this industry?
被演員的眼淚騙得團團轉，\n看來你不適合在娛樂圈混哦！=If you fell for an actor's tears, \nmaybe you're not cut out for this industry?
哈——！？=Hah-!?
就因為你不好好採訪，光顧著寫些假新聞，\n所以眼神才越來越差啊，你這混蛋！=Too busy writing fake news to spot real lies! No wonder your judgment's so rotten, you hack!
你、你這個臭小子！=Y-You brat!
……不過你剛才的話，\n也讓我意識到了一些事。=...But you did help me realize something.
我啊……\n無論在誰面前，都一直隱藏著「自己」。=I've... always hidden "myself" from everyone.
即使在舞臺上，我也不敢投入感情，\n所以表演也流於表面。=Even on stage, I held back, \nmy acting was empty.
是因為會傷害到別人……嗎？\n不。=Because I'd hurt others...? No.
如果我展現出真實的自我，\n恐怕會再次傷害別人什麼的……=If I show my true self, \nI might hurt someone again...
我其實是為了遠離這種恐懼，\n才一直在偽裝自己而已。=I have been pretending to be myself just to stay away from this fear.
媽媽和爸爸的事，也不過都是藉口。\n我其實只是……=Mom and dad were just excuses. I was just...
害怕「自己」的心靈受傷，\n才一直對身邊的人撒謊啊！=Scared of hurting "myself", \nso I keep lying to the people around me!
哈……{{B}}！\n你這不是都明白嘛，{{A}}！=Ha... {{B}}! \nFinally, you get it, {{A}}!
你只不過是為了自己在撒謊罷了！=You lied for your own sake!
沒事的哦，{{A}}。撒謊也沒關係！\n因為那樣就可以獲得幸福嘛！=It's fine, {{A}}. Keep lying! \nThat's how you'll be happy!
欺騙身邊的人，剷除礙事的傢伙！\n跟我一起，一起創造撒謊者的極樂世界吧！=Deceive everyone! Crush your enemies! \nJoin me in a paradise of liars!
別把他跟你混為一談！=<size\=30>Don't lump him in with you!</size>
{{A}}的謊言是不一樣的！=<size\=30>{{A}}'s lies were different!</size>
謝謝你，WONDER。\n但……我已經不想偽裝自己了。=Thank you, Wonder. But... I'm done pretending.
所有的謊言，本質都是一樣的。\n我也是為了自己的幸福才一直撒謊的。=All lies are the same in the end. \nI was lying for myself.
只不過……到此為止了。=But... no more.
我心裡知道。即使讓父母看到真實的我……\n他們也絕不會放棄我的。=Deep down, I knew... even if my parents saw my true self, they'd never give up on me.
還有戲劇部的夥伴們。就算我……\n展示最真實的自己，他們也一定會接受的。=And my drama club friends... Even if I showed my true self, they'd still accept me.
還有看我演出的人們也是……\n他們想看的，是我真正的演技。=And the audience too... \nWhat they want is my genuine performance.
最重要的是……我身邊還有對我不離不棄、\n不顧安危也要拯救我的夥伴們！=Above all... I have friends who'll stand by me no matter what, who'd risk their lives for me!
面對這樣的大家……\n我怎麼還能繼續說謊呢！！=How could I keep lying... to everyone who believes in me!!
跟{{A}}的自己訣別吧=<size\=27>Leave your false self behind</size>
不要放棄慾望……！=<size\=30>Don't give up desires...!</size>
嗯，我不會再自暴自棄了！\n我會「誠實」地面對自己、面對大家！=Yes, no more self-pity! I will face myself and everyone with "honesty"!
我再也不會放棄我的慾望了！=I won't give up my desires ever again!

Shoki Awakening Battle
----------
唔，小心！那傢伙似乎……\n能對攻擊目標留下特殊的「標記」！=Hm, careful! That guy seems to be able to... leave a special "mark" on the target!
而且這股力量的波動……被『標記』後\n一旦受到攻擊，可能會陷入異常狀態！=This energy... anyone "marked" will be inflicted with Mental Ailments when hit!
只要保護好被『標記』的同伴就行了吧？\n交給我吧！=So we just need to protect whoever gets "marked", right? Leave it to me!

呼……總算是有驚無險……\n如果沒有{{A}}，不知道會發生什麼呢……=Whew... That was close... If it weren't for {{A}}, who knows what might've happened...
說什麼呢，\n是你們救了我才對吧？=What are you talking about? \nYou guys saved me, remember?
謝謝你們，真的。\n比起這個，大家有沒有受傷？都沒事吧？=Thank you, really. More importantly, is everyone okay? Any injuries?
嗯，放心吧！=Yeah, don't worry!
……不對！{{A}}你沒事吧？=...Wait! {{A}}, are you alright?
覺醒了{{A}}後，\n一般都會很疲倦的……=Awakening a {{A}} usually leaves people completely exhausted...
啊……\n的確有種被抽走了好多體力的感覺。=Ah... Now that you mention it, \nI do feel pretty drained.
不過，比起2小時的舞臺連演，\n這點疲憊不算什麼！=But compared to a two-hour stage performance, this is nothing!
哦哦，不愧是{{A}}！\n體力不是一般的強啊……！=Whoa, as expected from {{A}}! \nYour stamina is incredible...!
明明我跟WIND，\n在{{A}}覺醒後都頭暈眼花的……=When Wind and I awakened our {{A}}s, \nwe were practically seeing stars...
不如說是大家更辛苦吧？\n一直在邊保護我邊戰鬥。=If anything, you guys had it tougher, right? Protecting me while fighting.
那麼，CATTLE。\n我們能不能先返回一下現實世界？=So, Cattle. Should we return to the real world for now?
外面已經沒有{{B}}的氣息了。\n現在應該可以安全離開{{A}}了……=I don't sense the {{B}} outside anymore. We should be able to leave the {{A}} safely...
可是，不立刻讓{{A}}改心嗎？\n拖下去會很危險吧？=But shouldn't we change {{A}}'s heart immediately? Isn't delaying dangerous?
那傢伙在現實世界裡，\n正準備陷害{{A}}的父母吧？=In the real world, she's about to frame {{A}}'s parents, right?
……嗯，吾覺得應該沒問題。=...Hmm, I believe it's fine.
剛才{{A}}和WONDER，\n不是把那個像魔杖似的錄音筆弄壞了嗎？=Didn't {{A}} and Wonder destroy that wand-like voice recorder earlier?
她離開這裡就是因為那東西壞了，\n還命令部下去修理。=She left because it was broken, \nordering her underlings to repair it.
原來如此。\n那個魔法錄音筆對她就是「力量的象徵」。=I see. That magic voice recorder was her "symbol of power".
而那個象徵被WONDER他們毀掉了。\n她的陰影意識到了這一點。=And that symbol was destroyed by Wonder. \nHer Shadow recognized this.
這意味著，\n現實裡的{{A}}應該也會受到一些影響吧？=Meaning the real {{A}} should be affected too, right?
沒錯。\n那傢伙膨脹的信心可能會有所動搖。=Correct. Their inflated confidence may be shaken.
意思是和平時正相反？\n認知世界中發生的事，也會影響到現實？=So the opposite of usual? Cognition affecting reality this time?
那她現在就沒那麼有自信了吧。\n說不定暫時不會寫假新聞了？=Then she's probably less confident now. \nMaybe she'll hold off on fake news?
不過，這也是吾一廂情願的推測。\n畢竟現實中的錄音筆並不會消失……=Though this is just speculation. \nHer real voice recorder isn't actually gone...
不管怎樣時間不多了=Time is running out
還是儘快行動為好=We should act soon
……不，沒事的。\n雖然來{{A}}之前我動搖了……=...No, it's fine. While I was shaken before coming to the {{A}}...
但就算{{A}}寫再多的假新聞,\n我的父母也不會軟弱到受她擺佈。=Even if {{A}} writes more fake news, my parents aren't weak enough to bend to her will.
我爸應該會照顧好我媽，\n反而搞不好會變得更加卿卿我我了。=My dad would support my mom, they might actually become more affectionate.
卿卿……我我……！=More... affectionate...?
他們真的又熱情，又堅強。\n只是我之前單方面不敢相信爸媽而已……=They're passionate and strong. I was just the one who couldn't believe in them...
所以不用擔心我們。\n還是集中精力想辦法讓{{A}}改心吧。=So don't worry about us. Let's focus on changing {{A}}'s heart.
與其勉強追趕那傢伙，不如先養精蓄銳。\n我們回去吧，WONDER。=Rather than rushing after her, we should regroup. Let's return, Wonder.
我知道了，回去吧=Got it, let's go back
謝謝你能這麼說=Thanks for saying that
啊，等等等等！\n回去之前……=Ah, wait wait! Before we go...
我們先定一下{{A}}的代號吧！=We need to decide {{A}}'s code name!
代號？\n啊，就是像WONDER或SOY那種？=Code name? Ah, like Wonder or Soy?
嗯。目前大家都是……\n以自己覺得「不可思議的東西」起的！=Yeah! Currently... everyone's is based on something they find "mysterious"!
哦～不可思議的東西啊……=Oh～ Something mysterious...
啊，盡可能用外語哦！\n可別用醬油什麼的！=Ah, preferably in a foreign language! \nNo soy sauce or anything!
求能不能放過我啊喂！=Give me a break here!
不可思議的東西，外語……\n嗯……=Something mysterious... in a foreign language... Hmm...
那就……\n「LUCE」吧？=Then... how about "Luce"?
LUCE？{{A}}，感覺好帥……！\n是什麼意思呀？=Luce? {{A}}, that sounds cool...! \nWhat does it mean?
在義大利語裡是「光」的意思。=It means "light" in Italian.
我在舞臺上的時候，\n總會被「光」的作用和不可思議所震撼。=When I'm on stage, I'm always amazed by how "light" works.
只需調整燈光的顏色，\n就能改變時間和季節……=Just changing its color can alter time and seasons...
即便沒有人在那裡，\n也可以使用聚光燈來表現人的動作。=Even with no actors present, a spotlight can convey movement.
這簡直就像魔法一樣，不是嗎？\n小時候爸爸教我時，我就很感動。=It's practically magic, isn't it? My dad taught me this when I was little.
這樣啊～！=I see～!
既能欺騙他人，也能引人入勝。\n這就是「光」。=It can both deceive and captivate. \nThat's "light".
我的名字{{A}}，也蘊含著來自爸媽的……\n「成為舞臺上閃耀的明星」的祝福。=My name {{A}} carries my parents' blessing too... "shine like a star on stage".
所以我的代號也想用「光」。\n如何？=So I want my code name to be "light". \nHow is it?
我覺得很好啊，LUCE！=I think it's great, Luce!
嗯，我也覺得很棒。=Yes, I think it's great too.
{{A}}，LUCE！=<size\=30>{{A}}, Luce!</size>
那我們回去吧，LUCE！=Then let's head back, Luce!

Choice 1
沒問題。\n{{A}}啊，WONDER！=Alright. {{A}}, Wonder!
Choice 2
沒問題。\n我們走吧，WONDER！=Alright. Let's go, Wonder!

{{A}}……好累啊……\n好想馬上洗個澡、鑽被窩啊……={{A}}... I'm exhausted... I just wanna take a shower and crash...
今天就先解散吧。\n啊，對了……=Let's call it a day. Oh, right...
{{B}}，還有{{A}}，\n你們直接叫我「{{C}}」就行了。={{B}}, {{A}}, you can just call me "{{C}}" now.
sr:"^(.*)和(.*)，\n也都跟我用平語了呢。$"="$1 and $2 already speak casually with me too."
這樣嗎？\n那你也可以直接叫我{{A}}。=Oh really? Then you can call me {{A}}.
我也是，叫我{{A}}就行～！\n{{C}}哦，{{B}}！=Same here! Just call me {{A}}～! {{C}}, {{B}}!
{{B}}。感覺好棒啊。\n現在的{{A}}，更像「真正的自己」了。={{B}}. This feels great. You seem more like your "true self" now, {{A}}.
這都多虧了你們啊。\n以後，我再也不會對自己和別人說謊了。=It's all thanks to you guys. I won't lie to myself or others anymore.
怪盜活動也務必讓我幫忙！\n{{A}}！=Please let me help with the Phantom Thief activities too! {{A}}!
唔，{{B}}，{{A}}。=Hm, {{B}}, {{A}}.
{{A}}！？\n剛才這隻貓頭鷹是不是說話了！？={{A}}!? Did that owl just talk!?
Oh mio Dio！！\nMamma mia！！=Oh mio Dio!!\nMamma mia!
的確，你是第一次聽到{{A}}說話呢……\n那個，這就是現實中的CATTLE。=Ah right, this is your first time hearing {{A}} speak... Well, this is the real Cattle.
{{A}}？大家……？={{A}}? Everyone...?
{{B}}，{{A}}！？\n你不是說因為分鏡有問題，回去了嗎？={{B}}, {{A}}!? Didn't you say you went home to fix storyboard issues?
嗯，本來是這樣的，\n但我需要參考照片……=Yes, that was the plan, but I needed reference photos...
所以就來{{A}}拍了點照，\n這就要回家繼續畫了。=So I came to {{A}} to take some photos, \nI was just heading back to keep drawing.
路過的女性=Female Passersby
哎呀，抱歉……=Ah, sorry...
沒、沒事……=I-it's fine...
啊，手機……=Ah, my phone...
別擔心，好像並沒有摔壞。=Don't worry, it didn't break.
謝謝你，{{A}}。=Thank you, {{A}}.
大家這是剛排練完嗎？\n好像都很疲勞的樣子。=Were you all rehearsing? \nYou look pretty worn out.
那個、嗯！沒錯！\n有點用力過猛了……=Uh, yeah! Exactly! We kinda overdid it...
是啊。我們想著要不要喝點茶，\n所以順便來了{{A}}這邊。=Right. We were thinking of getting tea, \nso we stopped by {{A}}.
是……這樣啊。=I... see.
對了，{{A}}也一起去吧？=Right, {{A}}, wanna join us?
不了，我還得趕緊回去畫完分鏡呢。=No, I have to go back and finish the storyboard.
那我先告辭了。=I'll take my leave now.
你要加油哦～！=Do your best～!
那，我們也解散吧。=Alright, let's disband for today.
{{B}}？怎麼了，{{A}}？={{B}}? What is it, {{A}}?
剛才……我不是幫{{A}}撿手機嗎？\n我不小心看到了……=Just now... when I picked up {{A}}'s phone, \nI accidentally saw...
她的手機裡……\n有「{{A}}的圖示」。=Her phone... has the "{{A}} icon".
什麼！？真的嗎，{{A}}！=What!? Is that true, {{A}}!
嗯，我確定我沒看錯。=Yes, I'm not mistaken, I definitely saw it.
那就是說……=That means...
那{{A}}她……=Then {{A}}...
也就是說，她也可以進出{{A}}……\n也能像我一樣覺醒{{B}}嗎？=So she can enter the {{A}} too... \nAnd awaken a {{B}} like me?
不一定……\n有可能她是敵方的人。=Not necessarily... \nShe might be working for the enemy.
……敵人？怎麼回事？=...Enemy? What do you mean?
那個，實際上……=Well, actually...
幕後黑手！\n竟然還有這種傢伙……！=A mastermind! \nThere is actually someone like that...!
我不知道{{A}}究竟是不是……\n不過，我確實想起了一件事。=I don't know if {{A}}'s involved... \nBut I just remembered something.
今天，我們進入{{A}}的時候，\n「啟動{{B}}」的人……是誰？=Today, when we entered the {{A}}, who "activated the {{B}}"...?
那……不是{{A}}嗎？=Wasn't... that {{A}}?
不，我不記得自己點過那個圖示。\n當時覺得有可能是不小心按到了。=No, I don't remember clicking it. Just that there's a chance I messed up.
……現在回想起來，我覺得不是我按的。=...But even if I think about it now, I don't think I clicked it.
那如果是這樣，\n就有可能是當時在場的其他人……=Then that means, \nsomeone else present at the time...
把吾等強制送到了{{A}}。=...Forcibly sent us into the {{A}}.
可、可是……\n{{A}}那個時候已經先一步回家了吧……=B-but... {{A}} said she went home early, right...?
她只是那麼說，然後離開了體育館。\n我們誰都沒看到她到底回沒回家。=She just said that and left the gym. \nNone of us actually saw her leave.
的確如此……\n莫非真是{{A}}幹的？=That's true... So {{A}} really did it?
雖然還不能確定……=It's not confirmed yet...
也許應該調查一下她的情報呢。\n而且，要格外小心。=Maybe we should look into her. \nAnd stay cautious.
唔……大家今天都累了。\n還是先回去休息後再商量吧。=Hmm... Everyone's tired today. \nLet's rest first and discuss later.
也是……\n隊長，那就這麼定了？=Right... Leader, is that okay?

----------
Chapter 4 Part 2 Day 1
----------
叫大家在排練結束後過來集合，\n其實不是為了別的……=Gathering everyone after rehearsal... \nI assure you, there's a reason for this.
是想說{{A}}的事情吧？=It's about {{A}}, right?
沒錯，{{A}}……=Yes, {{A}}...
首先……\n她早已知道吾等{{A}}的身份。=First and foremost... She's known our {{A}} identities all along.
當時還真是嚇了一跳啊～\n沒想到我們發{{A}}被她給看到了。=That was quite a shock～ Who knew she'd seen us sending the {{A}}?
……{{B}}？\n也就是說，{{A}}第一次見我們的時候就……=...{{B}}? That means when {{A}} first met us...
沒錯。\n那時候她就已經知道吾等的真實身份了。=Mhm. She already knew our true identities back then.
當時我就覺得很奇怪，\n因為她主動得有點不正常。=I thought it was strange at the time, \nshe was unusually proactive about helping.
的確，當初要不是她極力爭取，\n合演應該早就被取消了。=That's true, if she hadn't pushed so hard, \nthe joint play would've been canceled.
為什麼她要做到這種地步？\n難道就是為了接近{{A}}嗎？=Why go that far? Was it just to get close to the {{A}}?
按{{A}}的說法，她是因為對{{B}}很感興趣，\n所以想協助我們……=According to {{A}}, she was just interested in us... But can we really trust that?
不能相信她=Can't trust her
雖然很想相信她……=<size\=30>I want to trust her, but...</size>
說實話，確實很難完全相信她。\n而且她手機裡還有{{A}}的圖示。=In truth, it's hard to fully trust her. Especially with that {{A}} icon on her phone.
也許前幾天我們突然被傳送進{{A}}，\n就是她幹的。=Our sudden teleportation into the {{A}} the other day... that might've been her doing.
吾再確認一遍，\n{{A}}誤觸{{B}}的可能性已經被排除了吧？=Let me confirm once more, we've eliminated the possibility of {{A}} triggering the {{B}} by accident, haven't we?
我也很在意，所以仔細回想了一下……\n我覺得我沒點過。=I've thought carefully... \nI'm certain I didn't tap it.
我只是發現了沒見過的圖示……\n一眨眼後就已經在{{A}}了。=I just noticed an unfamiliar icon... \nand suddenly I'm in the {{A}}.
我們就不用說了，\n那時候誰都沒啟動過{{A}}。=Needless to say, it wasn't us, \nnone of us activated the {{A}}.
畢竟{{A}}說過很多遍呢，\n只能在{{B}}的站前廣場啟動。={{A}} always said we can only activate it at {{B}} Station Square.
果然是{{A}}吧……？=It's really {{A}}...?
也許另有其人……=Maybe someone else...
只能說有這個可能。=We can't rule out the possibility.
雖然也有這個可能……\n但更可能就是{{A}}啟動的。=While that is a possibility... \nthe more likely culprit was {{A}}.
假如真是{{A}}啟動的，\n她為什麼要這麼做呢？=If {{A}} did activate it... what was her motive?
比如說……想讓{{A}}攻擊我們？=Like... to have {{A}} attack us?
也許吧。那她要麼是「幕後推手」本人，\n要麼就是那邊的爪牙了。=Perhaps. In that case, she's either the "mastermind", or one of their pawns.
也許吧。那她要不然是「幕後黑手」本人，\n要不然就是那邊的爪牙了。=Perhaps. In that case, she's either the "mastermind", or one of their pawns.
{{A}}……我好難接受啊！={{A}}... I can't believe this!
{{A}}是個好孩子吧，對吧？\n雖然確實有點頑固且奇葩的地方啦，但是……={{A}}'s a good kid, right? \nShe's a a bit stubborn and eccentric, but...
冷靜點，{{A}}。\n還沒百分百確認她的嫌疑呢。=Calm down, {{A}}. \nWe're not 100 percent certain yet.
我們只是在討論這個可能性而已。=We're just discussing possibilities.
哎呀就算是這樣……！=Even so...!
不過，假設{{A}}就是那個什麼「幕後推手」，\n想要除掉你們的話……=But hypothetically, if {{A}} was the "mastermind" and wanted to eliminate you guys...
不過，假設{{A}}就是那個什麼「幕後黑手」，\n想要除掉你們的話……=But hypothetically, if {{A}} was the "mastermind" and wanted to eliminate you guys...
為什麼還要特意告訴大家，\n她知道{{A}}的真實身份呢？=Why go out of her way to reveal she knows your {{A}} identities?
這樣做只會讓你們產生戒心吧。=That would only make you guys wary.
是啊。如果是假裝支持我們來贏得信任，\n然後趁我們不備時再動手，倒也說得過去……=Right. If they faked support to earn our trust, then backstabbed us, that would make sense.
但結果又是把我們強行送到{{A}}處理掉，\n那根本沒必要提前挑明我們的身份。=But in the end, they just forcibly sent us to the {{A}} to get rid of us, so why even bother exposing our identities beforehand.
這麼說，{{A}}應該就不是幕後推手了吧……=So maybe {{A}}'s not the mastermind...
這麼說，{{A}}應該就不是幕後黑手了吧……=So maybe {{A}}'s not the mastermind...
不過，吾等返回{{A}}時，\n她正好也在那裡，這也太可疑了吧？=But her appearing exactly when we returned to {{A}}...
讓人感覺，\n她似乎知道吾等返回現實的地點和時機。=It's like she knew our return point and timing.
聽你這麼一說，的確……=Now that you mention it...
{{A}}……腦子好亂啊！={{A}}... My brain hurts!
還是很可疑……=Still suspicious...
{{A}}沒有嫌疑=<size\=30>{{A}} might be innocent</size>
完全搞不懂了……=I'm completely lost...
沒錯，總之要繼續提防{{A}}。\n吾等必須提高警惕。=Exactly. In any case, we must keep our guard up around {{A}}.
雖然吾理解你的心情……=I understand where you're coming from...
但{{A}}還是個要提防的人。\n吾等必須提高警惕。=But {{A}} remains a threat. \nWe must keep our guard up.
畢竟現階段也沒有確鑿的證據……=After all, we lack conclusive proof at this stage...
但毫無疑問，{{A}}依然是要提防的人。\n吾等必須提高警惕。=Still, there's no question, \nwe must keep our guard up around {{A}}.
話說，我在網上查了一下{{A}}……\n不，應該是漫畫家{{B}}。=Speaking of which, I looked up {{A}}...\nor rather, the manga artist {{B}}.
她似乎很少發自己的私事。=She rarely shares private matters.
雖然能查到很多漫畫的分析資料，\n但基本沒有和她個人相關的情報。=There are loads of manga analysis online,\nbut almost nothing about her private life.
而且{{A}}也沒怎麼用SNS。={{A}} barely uses SNS either.
非要說令人在意的事……\n就只有之前，漫畫長期停更那次了。=The only notable thing... \nwas that long hiatus years ago.
啊！我記得那件事！\n正好那時候我剛入坑呢～=Ah! I remember that! \nRight when I got into her work～
當時她一直沒恢復連載，我就很好奇，\n特意跑去粉絲網站看了看……=Back then, when she still hadn't resumed the series, I got really curious and went to check the fan sites...
有人說{{A}}去世了，有人說生重病住院了，\n說什麼的都有，我當時真的好擔心呢！=People were saying everything from "the author died" to "she's in hospital", I was freaking out!
{{A}}還看了粉絲網站啊。\n那應該比我更清楚了。=You're still checking the fan sites, {{A}}?\nThen you should know more than me.
你還知道其他和{{A}}，\n或者{{B}}相關的消息嗎？=You know anything else about {{A}} or {{B}}?
{{A}}？嗯……我想想啊……={{A}}? Hmm... Let me think...
對了，{{B}}的{{C}}，\n好像是以{{A}}的親生姐姐為原型的呢！=Ah! The protagonist of {{B}} is based on {{A}}'s older sister!
雖然我沒讀到，但聽說漫畫開始連載時，\n作者寄語裡是這麼寫的！=The author's note mentioned it when serialization began!
{{B}}——{{A}}原來有個姐姐啊。={{B}}, {{A}} has a sister?
哥哥的角色有原型嗎？=<size\=21>What inspired the older brother character?</size>
母親的角色有原型嗎？=<size\=24>What inspired the mother character?</size>
嗯……到底有沒有呢……\n抱歉，我不記得啦。=Hmm... was there one? \nI don't remember.
漫畫停更的理由是什麼？=Why did the manga go on hiatus?
只說是「身體不適」呢。\n結果一斷更就是半年……=They only said it was due to 'health issues". \nThen the hiatus lasted half a year...
是啊。粉絲網站那邊也各種猜測滿天飛，\n但大家好像都不知道實際情況。=Yes. The fan sites were full of speculation, \nbut nobody seemed to know the truth.
身體不適了半年，\n肯定是住院了吧？=Six months for "health issues", \nthey must've been hospitalized, right?
住院嗎……\n那她當時的同班同學可能會記得。=If she was hospitalized... \nher classmates might remember.
也許能找到什麼線索。\n這件事就由我去打聽吧。=Maybe we can find some clues. \nI'll look into that.
那可幫大忙了。\n拜託你了，{{A}}。=That'd be a huge help. \nWe're counting on you, {{A}}.
但是……{{A}}真的是幕後推手嗎？\n總覺得她不像那麼可怕的人啊。=But... is {{A}} really the mastermind? \nI don't think she's a scary person.
但是……{{A}}真的是幕後黑手嗎？\n總覺得她不像那麼可怕的人啊。=But... is {{A}} really the mastermind? \nI don't think she's a scary person.
嗯……我也不相信{{A}}是那種人……=Yes... I don't believe {{A}} is that kind of person either...
……總之，{{A}}到底是敵人，\n還是單純地想要幫助吾等，現在還不清楚。=...In short, we still don't know if {{A}} is an enemy or simply trying to aid us.
但至少有一件事是明確的……=But one thing is certain...
她知道吾等的真實身份，\n而且是個擁有{{A}}的人類。=She knows our true identities, and she's a human with the {{A}}.
所以不能放鬆警惕。\n最近也儘量別去探索{{A}}了。=So stay vigilant. \nAvoid {{A}} exploration for now.
{{A}}，真的假的啊！？={{A}}, really!?
那{{B}}的事情要怎麼辦啊？\n那傢伙可是準備陷害{{A}}的爸媽啊！=What about {{B}}? \nThey're targetin' {{A}}'s parents!
關於這個嘛，自從上次遇到{{A}}之後，\n好像還沒有我父母的黑料被爆出來……=Actually, since our last encounter... no new scandals about my parents have surfaced.
而且他們周圍好像也沒發生什麼事。\n{{A}}似乎暫時還沒採取行動。=And nothing seems to be happening around them either. Looks like {{A}} hasn't made a move yet.
嗯。肯定是因為，\n{{A}}拿的那個魔法錄音筆……=Right. It must be because of that magic voice recorder {{A}} had...
它被吾等破壞了，所以對現實中的{{A}}，\n多少也產生了些影響吧。=Since we destroyed it, the real {{A}} must've been affected to some degree.
當然，不知道她能安分多久……=Of course, who knows how long she'll stay docile...
在{{A}}再次採取行動之前，\n吾等得先解決「後門進狼」的問題。=Before {{A}} makes another move, we'd better not jump from the frying pan into the fire.
後門進……狼？是什麼意思啊？=Frying... pan? What do you mean?
是指的那個吧？\n學校後門檢查我們隨身物品的{{A}}之類的。=It's that one right? Something about the teachers checkin' our bags?
真是的……！\n你們倆不知道「前門拒虎，後門進狼」嗎！=Honestly...! Do you two not know the saying "out of the frying pan into the fire"!
真是的……！　\n你們倆不知道「前門拒虎，後門進狼」嗎！=Honestly...! Do you two not know the saying "out of the frying pan into the fire"!
吾的意思是說……\n首先需要搞清楚{{A}}是敵是友！=What I'm saying is... our first priority is figuring out if {{A}} is friend or foe!
原來是這個意思啊～那你直說不就好啦，\n別搞那麼難懂的說法嘛。=Oh, so that's what you meant～ You could've just said so, no need to be so cryptic.
這個表達的確是有些難度。\n說起來……=That phrasing was pretty tricky... \nActually...
我早就有個疑問，\n為什麼{{A}}會那麼熟悉這些諺語？=I've been meaning to ask... Why does {{A}} know these sayings so well?
唔？其實啊……\n那是因為……=Hm? Actually... \nThat's because...
……因為什麼呢？=...Because why?
原來你自己也不知道啊！！=Wait, you don't know either!!
看你一副煞有介事的樣子，\n還以為你知道呢！！=You acted so serious, \nI totally thought you knew!!
看你一副故作玄虛的樣子，\n還以為你知道呢！！=You acted so serious, \nI totally thought you knew!!
喂，真是的——！\n{{A}}的果汁都噴到我這邊了！！=Hey, come on! \n{{A}}'s juice just splashed all over me!
……總、總之，已經定好方針了，\n今天到這裡吧。=...A-Anyway, we've settled our course. \nLet's call it a day.
對了，剛才中途跑題了……\n你是怎麼想的？{{A}}是敵人嗎？=Right, we got sidetracked earlier... What's your take? Is {{A}} an enemy?
可能是敵人=Probably an enemy
我不覺得她是敵人=She's not an enemy
唔，果然你也是這麼想的嗎。=Hmm, so you think so too.
那麼，她刻意接近吾等，\n嘴上說著要幫忙……=Then her approaching us, offering help...
應該是在謀劃什麼吧。\n必須更警惕一點才行。=She must be scheming something. \nWe'd better stay sharp.
也不怪你會這麼想。\n吾也沒想過「幕後推手」會是個女高中生。=I can't blame you. I never thought the "mastermind" would be a high school girl.
也不怪你會這麼想。\n吾也沒想過「幕後黑手」會是個女高中生。=I can't blame you. I never thought the "mastermind" would be a high school girl.
但也不能放鬆警惕。\n至少那傢伙看穿了吾等的真實身份啊……=Still, we can't let our guard down. \nShe knows who we really are, after all...
是啊。吾現在也找不到答案。=True. I don't have the answers either.
但不能放鬆警惕。\n至少那傢伙看穿了吾等的真實身份啊……=Still, we can't let our guard down. \nShe knows who we really are, after all...

{{A}}，請喝咖啡。=Here's your coffee, {{A}}.
這個影片是……=This video is...
哎呀，你發現了？{{B}}，沒錯。\n這是{{A}}出道時的舞臺劇哦。=Ara, you noticed? {{B}}, that's right. \nThis is {{A}}'s debut stage performance.
我記得他是以童星的身份，\n參演了他父親{{A}}的舞臺劇吧。=I remember he appeared as a child actor in his father {{A}}'s play.
你還挺了解的嘛。\n沒錯，是{{A}}7歲的時候呢。{{B}}……=You're quite knowledgeable. \nYes, this was when {{A}} was 7. {{B}}...
這就是原石的{{A}}呢。\n一眼就能看出來，好男人才能生出好男人。=This is when {{A}} is still rough. A real man breeds a real man, it's obvious at first glance.
這就是原石的光輝呢。\n一眼就能看出來，好男人才能生出好男人。=This is when Shoki is still rough. A real man breeds a real man, it's obvious at first glance.
從那個時候開始，我就已經在關注他了哦？\n然而，太遺憾了……=I've had my eye on him since then, you know? What a shame though...
從那個時候開始，我就已經在關注他了哦！\n然而，太遺憾了……=I've had my eye on him since then, you know? What a shame though...
他要是聽我的話，老老實實地成長，\n明明可以成為比他父親還厲害的演員。=If he'd just listened to me and grown up properly, he could've surpassed his father as an actor.
那個……{{A}}主編，我有些事情想請教，\n可以打擾一下嗎？=Um... Editor-in-chief {{A}}, may I trouble you with some questions?
哈～～真是的，挑這麼個時候。\n快進來吧。=Hah～～ Seriously, now of all times.\nFine, hurry in.
哈～～真是的，挑這個時候。\n快進來吧。=Hah～～ Seriously, now of all times.\nFine, hurry in.
戰戰兢兢的聲音=Trembling Voice
戰戰兢兢的社員=Trembling Employee
打、打擾了。那個……=S-Sorry to bother you. Um...
唔嗯！？好臭！\n你身上有味道！=Hmm!? You stink! \nYou reek of body odor!
啊、啊？=Huh?
我說你很臭！\n臭到離譜！你到底怎麼回事！？=I said you stink! Disgustingly so! \nWhat is wrong with you!
{{A}}……非、非常抱歉！=Uh... M-My deepest apologies!
最近……那個……\n我一直在通宵加班，所以……=Lately... umm... \nI've been pulling all-nighters, so...
哈？髒死了……\n居然這幅樣子就來找我……=Hah? Revolting... \nTo show up before me in this state...
你說的我聽都不想聽。\n趕緊去把那身臭味弄掉再來。=I refuse to hear it. \nGo wash that stench off immediately.
但、但是您現在必須確認一下……=B-But you need to review this now...
我說了你別靠近我！趕緊去附近的澡堂，\n消消毒，把自己洗乾淨再說！=I said don't come near me! Go to a bathhouse right now, and don't return until you're clean!
我說了別靠近我！趕緊去附近的澡堂，\n消消毒，把自己洗乾淨再說！=I said don't come near me! Go to a bathhouse right now, and don't return until you're clean!
還有，如果下次再這樣……\n你知道會發生什麼吧？=And if this happens again... \nYou know what'll happen, right?
是、是的……很抱歉……=Y-Yes... My apologies...
員工教育完全沒做到位……\n也得扣他上司的工資才行。=This shows complete failure in employee training... I'll have to dock his supervisor's pay too.
對了，刊登的內容和證據都找齊了嗎？=Speaking of which, is the exposé material ready?
把編輯們提供的情報彙編起來……\n我記得是交給你負責了對吧。=Compiling the editors' intel... \nWasn't that your responsibility?
……抱歉，因為得去義大利取材，\n所以好像要花不少時間。=...Apologies. The Italy investigation will require more time.
{{A}}～～真是的，\n拍幾張三流女星的照片，怎麼那麼費事啊。={{A}}～～ For heaven's sake. Why's it take so long to photograph some D-list starlet?
實在是……很抱歉。=I truly... am sorry.
算了。說不定{{A}}現在也冷靜下來了，\n我先去看看他的情況吧。=Whatever. Maybe {{A}}'s calmed down by now. I'll go check on him.
……那我先告辭了。=...Then I'll take my leave.

----------
Chapter 4 Part 2 Day 2
----------
……你們好。=...Hello.
{{C}}，我記得你是{{B}}戲劇部的部長吧！？\n為什麼來{{A}}了？={{C}}, aren't you the drama club president from {{B}}!? What brings you to {{A}}?
{{A}}堅持要我來。\n聽說你們缺人手？=Ikenami insisted I come. \nHeard you're shorthanded?
很缺=Very
難道是來幫忙的？=<size\=30>Are you here to help us?</size>
難道說，是來幫我們的！？=Don't tell me, you're actually here to help!?
算是吧……雖然對我來說，\n你們的舞臺劇根本就不重要。=I suppose... though personally, \nyour play means nothing to me.
但{{A}}反復強調，說什麼，\n「絕對是精彩的演出」「至少來看1次」。=But {{A}} kept pestering me, saying things like "It'll be an incredible performance" and "at least see it once".
這樣啊……！=I see...!
{{A}}。不過你們的演技真的進步很大。={{A}}. Though I must admit, \nyour acting has improved dramatically.
所以我想讓{{A}}的夥伴們都看看，\n看看你們的努力，和對舞臺的熱情。=So I thought I'd have my {{A}} members see for themselves, your dedication and passion for the stage.
然後我就想……如果他們親眼看過了，\n也認可了，是不是就願意幫忙了呢。=And then I considered... if they witness it firsthand and approve, perhaps they'd be willing to lend a hand.
他平時總端著一番架子，\n這次居然一直軟磨硬泡。=That usually pompous guy actually kept begging persistently this time.
想必你們會帶來一場精彩的表演吧？=I take it you'll deliver something spectacular?
{{A}}……話都說到這兒了，\n實在是有點壓力山大啊……={{A}}... Now that you put it that way, the pressure's really mounting...
{{A}}話都說到這裡了，\n實在是有點壓力山大啊……={{A}} Now that you put it that way, the pressure's really mounting...
{{A}}話都說到這兒了，\n實在是有點壓力山大啊……={{A}} Now that you put it that way, the pressure's really mounting...
……戲劇部和{{A}}，\n最近似乎關係變好了呢。=...Seems the drama club has been getting along better with {{A}} lately.
{{A}}……是嗎？={{A}}... Really?
是的。之前有一天，我先回家了，\n然後來了個很有名的製作人對吧？=Yes. Remember when I left early that one day, and that famous producer showed up?
啊～是那個跟{{A}}一起來的，\n很浮誇的傢伙吧。=Ah～ You mean that over the top guy with {{A}}?
那時候，{{A}}不是說要優先參加社團活動，\n拒絕了電視劇的邀約嘛。=At that time, {{A}} prioritized club activities over the TV drama offer, right?
{{A}}的人好像把這事發到了SNS上，\n在我們學校也有很多人討論呢。=Someone from {{A}} posted about it on SNS, \nit sparked quite the discussion at our school too.
原來是這樣啊。\n所以{{B}}戲劇部才跟{{A}}和好了吧！=I see. That's what reconciled {{B}}'s drama club with {{A}}!
並不只是這一個原因哦！=That's not the only reason though!
這傢伙啊，跑來求我們了呢。\n說無論如何都「想參加全戲」。=This guy actually came and pleaded with us. Said he'd do anything to perform in the All-Drama.
還用超大的嗓門一遍遍地說個不停……\n你在舞臺上說詞都沒那麼大聲過。=Kept repeating it at the top of his lungs... Never heard you project that well onstage.
嗯……我之前，\n一直沒能好好面對你們。=Yes... I used to never properly face you all.
即使你們不讓我參加全戲……\n我也只覺得「這也沒辦法」就直接放棄了。=Even when excluded from the All-Drama... I just accepted it as "it can't be helped" and gave up.
不過，我決定再也不這樣了。=But, I've decided to never do that again.
不管是面對舞臺，還是面對舞臺上的同伴，\n我都想全力以赴、真誠以待。=Whether it's the stage or my fellow performers, I want to give my all and be completely genuine.
所以，對於我嚮往的舞臺和角色，\n我會不惜一切代價地爭取。=So for the roles and stages I believe in, \nI'll fight tooth and nail to make them happen.
你變坦誠了=<size\=26>You've become more honest</size>
你慾望變強烈了=Your desire has grown
Si（是的）！畢竟偽裝自己沒有任何意義！=Si (Yes)! There's no point in pretending anymore!
哼，那就讓我看看，\n你的這份決心能堅持多久吧。=Hmph, we'll see how long this resolution of yours lasts.
當然也要先欣賞一下，\n你讚不絕口的{{A}}舞臺劇。=First, I'll judge for myself this {{A}} performance you keep praising.
嗯，你們看過之後，\n肯定也會想幫忙的！=Yes, once you see it, \nyou'll definitely want to help!
{{B}}，還真是責任重大呢。\n我們的演出可不能辜負了{{A}}的盛情推薦。={{B}}, that's quite the responsibility. Our performance better live up to {{A}}'s glowing recommendation.
{{A}}，開始緊張了～！={{A}}, I'm getting nervous～!
哈！放馬過來吧！\n讓你們見識一下我傾情出演的老媽！=Ha! Bring it on! Let me show you my passionate portrayal of the mother!
我會完美演繹哥哥的角色！=<size\=27>I'll perfectly embody the brother!</size>
放輕鬆點吧=Just relax
好不安……！=I'm so anxious...!
No，不用那麼用力過猛啦。\n正常發揮就沒問題。=No, don't overdo it. \nYour normal performance is enough.
Bene！沒錯，不需要用力過猛。\n正常發揮的話，你們肯定沒問題！=Bene! Exactly, no need to overdo it, you'll be great as you are!
來吧，讓我們迷倒他們吧！\n用我們的Palcoscenico（演出）！=Now let's dazzle them! \nWith our palcoscenico (stage)!
「我們是組織派來的……\n黑之戰鬥員……！」="We're sent by the organization... \nCombatant in Black...!"
「{{A}}……想靠近我的孩子，\n除非從我這個母親身上跨過去！」="{{A}}... You'll have to go through this mother first!"
「{{A}}！\n精彩啊，{{B}}的諸位！」="{{A}}! Magnificent, {{B}}!"
「這麼一來，你們組織也完蛋了！\n死心吧！」="With this, your organization is finished! \nJust give up already!"
「姐姐！快看！有炸彈……！」="Sister! Look! There's a bomb...!"
「沒錯！現在，你們要如何應對呢？\n要繼續對我窮追不捨……」="Exactly! Now what will you do? \nKeep going after me..."
「然後放棄這棟大樓裡的所有人嗎！\n哈——{{A}}！！」="And abandon everyone in this building? \nHa- {{A}}!!"
兩個我全都要！=I'll save both!
拯救生命，並把你逼入絕境！=<size\=29>I'll rescue everyone and corner you!</size>
太驚人了……！沒想到完成度能這麼高！\n你們之前應該都沒演過戲吧？=Incredible...! I never expected such polished acting! You're all first-timers, right?
Grazie！是不是大吃一驚？=Grazie! Surprised you, didn't we?
Bravo！大家真是太棒了！=Bravo! Everyone was amazing!
哎呀，當初小看你們，真是對不住啊。\n話說……=I owe you an apology for underestimating you. Speaking of which...
總覺得……你的演技變了呢，{{A}}。=Your acting... it's changed, {{A}}.
我一直覺得，你雖然演技很好，\n但只是在裝腔作勢罷了。=I always thought you were technically skilled, but just going through the motions.
不過……今天的你，那個……\n怎麼說呢，真的打動了我的心……=But today... how do I put this... \nYou genuinely moved me...
很厲害。=It's powerful.
應該是我請求你。\n請和我們一起參加……全戲吧。=If anything, I should be asking you... \nPlease join us... for the All-Drama.
部長……！=President...!
Evviva（萬歲）！！\n太棒了！！=Evviva (Hurray)!! \nAmazing!!
謝謝你，部長！\n讓我們拿下全戲的最高大獎吧！=Thank you, President! \nLet's aim for the top prize at the All-Drama!
等、喂、放開我啊！\n你呀，真是的……=W-Wait, let go of me!\nHonestly, you're so...
學園祭也{{A}}=<size\=20>Looking forward to the school festival</size>
r:"^嗯，多虧了你們，我才得以改變。\n謝謝你，(.*)……！$"="Yes, thanks to you all, I was able to change. Thank you, $1...!"
當然了！多虧了你們，我才得以改變……\n我會使出渾身解數來報答你們的！=Of course! Thanks to you all, I could change... I'll give it my all to repay you!
的確……{{A}}變化很大。\n跟之前排練時判若兩人呢……=Truly... {{A}} is different now. It's like night and day compared to earlier rehearsals...
我一直……\n都停不下速寫的手……=I couldn't stop... \nsketching the whole time...
Grazie，{{A}}！\n能聽到你這麼說，我真是鬆了一口氣。=Grazie, {{A}}! \nHearing you say that is such a relief.
Grazie，{{A}}！\n能聽到你這麼說，我真是松了一口氣。=Grazie, {{A}}! \nHearing you say that is such a relief.
{{B}}，「{{A}}」……？={{B}}, "{{A}}"...?
噢，如果有冒犯到你很抱歉。\n我太高興了，一不注意說順嘴了。=Oh, my apologies if that was presumptuous.\nI got carried away in my excitement.
不，其他人也叫我{{A}}，沒關係。\n只是，感覺你好像變得更開朗了呢……=No, the others call me {{A}} too. It's fine.\nIt's just, you seem brighter somehow...
請告訴我，{{A}}。\n你身上究竟發生了什麼……？=Please tell me, {{A}}.\nWhat exactly happened to you...?
發生了什麼……嗯，我想想啊。=What happened... hmm, let me think.
雖然很難說明，但最近有個事……\n讓我稍微回顧了一下以前的所作所為呢。=It's hard to explain, but recently something... \nmade me reflect on my past behavior.
那件事讓我下了決心。\n決定不再對自己說謊！=That experience made me decide to stop lying to myself!
原來如此……這樣啊。\n不對自己說謊……=I see... is that so.\nStop lying to yourself...
嗚、啊……！=Oh, ah...!
怎麼突然……腦袋……=What's wrong... with my head...
對、自己……撒謊……？=Lying... to myself...?
喂，{{A}}！振作點！=Hey, {{A}}! Can you hear me!
{{A}}的情況怎麼樣？=How's {{A}} doing?
送到保健室了，她一直在頭痛。\n不過臥床休息後似乎好多了。=She's in the infirmary with a bad headache. \nShe seems better after resting.
她說昨晚也工作到了很晚，\n可能是睡眠不足導致的。=Said she worked late last night too, \nprobably just sleep deprivation.
什麼啊，原來是沒睡夠啊，嚇死人了……=Oh, just lack of sleep? That scared me...
她說再休息一會兒，今天就回去了。\n還說不用送她。=She says she'll go home after resting a bit more. She also said not to walk her back.
她說再休息一下，今天就回去了。\n還說不用送她。=She says she'll go home after resting a bit more. She also said not to walk her back.
那應該沒問題了吧=That should be fine
還是很擔心啊=I'm still worried
回去之前，\n我會再去保健室看看她的情況的！=I'll check on her before leaving!
好。謝謝你啦，{{A}}。=Right. Thank you, {{A}}.
那麼，我們今天就先回去了。=Then, we'll head back for now.
雖然不能每天都來，\n但我們會儘量幫忙的。=We can't come daily, \nbut we'll help when possible.
畢竟你們獻上了這麼精彩的表演，\n跟{{A}}說的一模一樣啊。=After all, your performance was amazing, just like {{A}} promised.
幫大忙了=Huge help
一起打造精彩的舞臺吧=<size\=28>Let's make an amazing stage</size>
嗯，我們也會好好享受這個過程的。=Right, we'll enjoy the process too.
{{A}}，一個接著一個……\n命定的夥伴們集結到了一起……={{A}}... one by one... \ndestined companions gather...
這正是宿命·DESTINY……\n這場演出注定會名垂學園的史冊吧。=This is fate·DESTINY... \nThis will go down in school history!
這正是宿命·DESTINY……\n這場演出註定會名垂學園的史冊吧。=This is fate·DESTINY... \nThis will go down in school history!
噢，黑之戰鬥員！\n你的演技也十分有個性，很精彩呢！=Oh, Combatant in Black! \nYour acting was uniquely brilliant!
真、真的嗎！？\n快展開說說！=R-Really!? Please explain!
真、真的嗎！？\n快仔細說說！=R-Really!? Please explain!
{{A}}？好、嗯……\n那我們邊走邊說，可以嗎？={{A}}? S-Sure... Let's talk while we walk, okay?
好的！\n啊，各位，我先告辭了！=Yes! Ah, everyone, excuse me
{{A}}的那個性格……\n說不定意外地適合演戲呢。={{A}}'s personality... \nmight suit acting unexpectedly well.
{{A}}，也許吧。那麼……={{A}}, perhaps. Now then...
難得就只剩下我們幾個了，\n來聊一下「工作」的事情吧。=Since we're the only ones left, \nlet's discuss "work".

關於{{A}}的事，\n我向學校裡的人打聽過了……=About {{A}}, I asked around school...
不過很遺憾，\n她似乎沒什麼朋友。=Unfortunately, \nshe doesn't seem to have many friends.
大家說她經常請假，\n而且就算在教室裡，也總是在自己畫畫……=People say she's always absent, \neven in class she just draws alone...
還有人說，偶爾會在遊戲廳看到她，\n但是也沒怎麼搭過話……=Some saw her at arcades, \nbut they never spoke much...
我能打聽到的就這些了。=That's all I learned.
原來她經常請假啊？\n肯定是因為工作太忙吧。=She's always absent? \nThose must be work commitments.
估計是吧。好像還經常遲到。\n還有就是……=Probably. She's often late too. Also...
啊，對了對了！\n她好像租了間工作室，然後1個人住在那裡。=Ah right! She rents a studio apartment and lives there alone.
{{A}}，竟然是這樣啊！\n也就是說……她沒跟家人住在一起？=Wait, really! So... she's not living with her family?
1個人住啊……\n工作和家務都得自己來吧，真不容易啊。=Living alone... it must be tough handling work and housework.
可不是嘛。真讓人擔心。=Right. That's worring.
剛才她頭疼得還挺厲害的，\n身體沒事吧……=That headache seemed serious, \nI hope she's okay...
她有沒有好好吃飯啊。=Is she eating properly?
啊，對了，{{A}}初中的時候，\n好像還有段長時間的缺勤。=Oh, in middle school {{A}} had long absences too.
長時間缺勤？=Long absences?
啊！難道是，{{A}}停更的時候！？=Ah! Could it be when {{A}} went on hiatus!?
具體日期我不清楚……\n但大約是1年前的事。=I'm not sure on the exact dates... \nbut it was about a year ago.
那應該沒錯了！\n我記得就是那段時間停更的，我超級沮喪！=That matches! \nI remember I was devastated when it paused!
是因為不習慣一個人住，身體搞壞了嗎？=Was that because she got overwhelmed living alone?
知道她身體不適的原因嗎？=Do you know why she was unwell?
不，我這邊打聽到的不是身體不適，\n而是「家庭原因」哦？=No, from what I heard it wasn't illness, \napparently it's "family reasons".
不，我這邊打聽到的不是身體不適，\n而是「家庭原因」哦！=No, from what I heard it wasn't illness, \napparently it's "family reasons".
家庭原因？=Family reasons?
什麼樣的原因？=What kind of reasons?
嗯，並不是身體不適。=Yes, it wasn't health-related.
是什麼樣的原因呢？=What exactly was the reason?
不清楚……沒打聽到那麼細。\n雖然我也姑且問了一下她當時的同班同學。=I'm not sure... I couldn't get many details, though I did ask some of her former classmates.
好像班主任給的解釋是，\n「由於家庭原因，要缺勤一段時間」。=Seemed like her homeroom teacher simply stated that she would be "absent for a period due to family reasons".
大家總覺得是不能過問的事情，\n所以也沒問班主任或者本人到底怎麼回事。=Everyone seemed to understand it wasn't something they should pry into, so no one asked the teacher or her for specifics.
啊……這類問題的確是不方便問啊……=Ah... That does sound like a sensitive matter...
停更也是出於家庭原因？=<size\=24>Was the hiatus also family reasons?</size>
家庭原因導致身體不適？=<size\=26>Family reasons made her unwell?</size>
Choice 1
是啊……可能「家庭原因」不太方便公佈，\n所以才對外說身體不適呢。=Right... Maybe they can't disclose those "family reasons", that's why she said it's because of her health.
Choice 2
有可能啊。\n或者……=That's possible, or...
「家庭原因」這種理由不太方便公開，\n所以才對外說身體不適呢。=They can't disclose those "family reasons", \nthat's why she said it's because of her health.
無論如何……=Regardless...
那時候她遇到了什麼困難，\n讓她無法繼續上學或工作吧。=Whatever happened back then must've forced her out of school and work
好在意啊。\n不過既然當時的同學都不好問……=I'm so curious. Though since even her classmates avoided asking...
那應該也是那種，\n連本人都不想在學校說出來的事情吧……=It must be something she wouldn't want discussed in school at all...
唔……\n看來她有什麼秘密啊……=Hmm... It seems she is hiding some secrets...
但不搞清楚關鍵內容，就無從判斷。\n該怎麼辦才好呢……=But without the full picture, we can't make a call. What's our move here...?
雖然很在意{{A}}的事，\n但我們就這樣把{{B}}放著不管了嗎。=As much as I'm concerned about {{A}}, are we really just going to leave the {{B}} like this?
再拖下去，說不定{{A}}又要作妖了。=If we drag this out any longer, {{A}} might start stirring up trouble again.
但是，{{A}}可是有{{B}}的哦？=And yet... {{A}} is in possession of the {{B}}, are you not aware? 
但是，{{A}}可是有{{B}}的哦！=And yet... {{A}} is in possession of the {{B}}, are you not aware? 
在摸清楚那傢伙的想法之前，\n也不能視而不見啊……=We can't just ignore that fact...
乾脆直接問問本人？=Let's just ask them?
找她本人聊聊看吧=<size\=28>Let's talk to her in person</size>
什麼……你是認真的嗎！？=Wait... you can't be serious!?
問她「你就是幕後推手嗎」，\n人家難道就會乖乖承認嗎！=If we just ask "Are you the mastermind?", \nyou think she'd actually confess!?
問她「你就是幕後黑手嗎」，\n人家難道就會乖乖承認嗎！=If we just ask "Are you the mastermind?", \nyou think she'd actually confess!?
不過，跟她本人談談，\n也許能打探出她的想法呢。=But, having a genuine conversation with her might help us understand her true intentions.
是啊……不管怎麼在週邊調查，\n也解決不了核心問題。=Right... No amount of indirect investigation will get us to the heart of this matter.
直接跟她本人交談，\n打探出她的想法，可能會更快一點吧。=Speaking with her directly would likely yield answers much faster.
畢竟是{{A}}自己說對{{B}}感興趣的。=After all, {{A}} was the one who expressed interest in the {{B}}.
那我們就從這個話題聊起，\n試探一下她的本意如何？=Perhaps we could use that as our starting point to carefully probe her real motives?
……也就是說，故意幫她給漫畫取材嗎。=...That is to say, we should offer to help with her manga research as a pretext?
我覺得挺好的。\n反正我們的真實身份已經暴露了。=I think that's fine. Our secret identities are already compromised anyway.
那明天放學時就約她？\n比如說，大家一起去家庭餐廳！=Wanna invite her after school tomorrow? \nMaybe the whole group can go to a diner!
不，如果要讓她放鬆警惕來套出情報的話，\n還是1對1比較好。=No, if we want her to let her guard down, \na one-on-one setting would be better.
1對1嗎～那麼……=One-on-one～ Then...
我去和她聊聊吧=I'll talk to her
我覺得{{A}}合適=I think {{A}} fits
Choice 1
贊成！\n這種事肯定要隊長來才行呢！=Agreed! \nThis is clearly a job for our leader!
謝謝，你總是毫不猶豫地衝在前頭。\n那就拜託你啦。=Thank you for always taking the lead. \nWe're counting on you.
Choice 2
r:"^不，我覺得比起我，\n(.*)更合適呢。$"="Actually... $1 would be more appropriate."
你跟她一起去過{{A}}，\n共處的時間在我們之中是最長的吧？=You've accompanied her to {{A}}, \nso you've spent the most time with her, right?
說得對！這裡還是要隊長出馬！=Right! This calls for the leader's expertise!
r:"^好，那麼對(.*)問話一事，\n就交給(.*)吧。$"="Right, the task of questioning $1 shall be entrusted to $2."
那麼，今天就先解散吧。\n拜託你了，隊長！=Let's call it a day for now. \nWe're relying on you, Leader!

r:"^那個，(.*)。\n關於對(.*)套話的事……$"="Hey, $1. Regarding our plan to probe $2 for information..."
吾覺得事不宜遲，明天就應該開始。\n你打算怎麼做？=We shouldn't waste time, let's begin tomorrow. \nWhat's your approach?
發訊息約約看=Try messaging them
明天放學後約她看看=Meet her after school
怎麼辦才好呢……=What to do...
Choice 1
嗯。畢竟那傢伙工作也很忙。\n最好現在就跟她約一下時間啊。=Indeed. Considering how busy she is with work, it would be best to schedule a time now.
Choice 2
也是。不過那傢伙很忙吧。=True. Though she does have a packed schedule.
吾覺得現在先發個訊息約一下她比較好。=I recommend sending her a message now to arrange something.
Choice 3
莫非你是擔心她頭疼的事，在猶豫嗎？=Perhaps you're hesitating because of her headache earlier?
但要對{{A}}改心，吾等也沒多少時間了。\n所以吾想儘快約她出來。=But we're running out of time to change {{A}}'s heart. That's why I want to arrange this meeting quickly.
如果身體不舒服，{{A}}應該會拒絕的吧。\n總之先發個訊息約她試試，如何？=If she's unwell, {{A}} would likely decline anyway. Why not try messaging her first?
你睡了嗎？=Are you asleep?
r:"^(.*){{A}}？\n怎麼了\n這個時間找我$"="$1-senpai?\nWhat's wrong?\nTexting me at this hour."
我覺得你可能需要些素材=I think you might need some references
我想跟你聊聊天=I want to talk to you
Choice 1
這個意思難道是\n你願意跟我說\n{{A}}的事情了嗎=You mean...\nYou want to talk about {{A}}?
Choice 2
我現在在工作\n下次行嗎？=I'm working now,\nmaybe next time?
如果要聊{{A}}，那倒是可以=If you want to talk about {{A}}, that's okay.
當然是{{A}}的事=Of course it's about {{A}}
我要提供你些素材=I'm giving you some references
我要給你提供些素材=I'm giving you some references
十分歡迎=It's very welcomed!
別發訊息了\n我想直接見面說=Stop sending messages,\nI want to meet in person!
明天放學後\n你有時間嗎=Do you have time after school tomorrow?
那等排練結束後=After the rehearsal
太感謝了！！！=Thank you very much!!!
一下子有了幹勁了\n感覺原稿也能突破瓶頸了=A surge of motivation hit me! I might finally break through this creative block!
那麼\n晚安=Good night then!
她、她可真是非常積極啊……=S-She seems unusually enthusiastic...
從她的反應裡，\n能感受到她只是單純地想要素材，但……=From her responses, it feels like she genuinely just wants reference, but...
但願她是友軍=<size\=29>I hope she's on our side</size>
我會保持警惕的=I'll remain cautious
Choice 1
是啊……吾也並非想懷疑她。=Indeed... I don't want to distrust her either.
不過，不可放鬆警惕。=But we mustn't let our guard down.
Choice 2
嗯。畢竟現在最可疑的就是{{A}}。=Right. Currently, {{A}} is our top suspect.
明天盡可能不透露這邊的情報，\n多打探點她的底細吧。=Tomorrow, we'll gather intel while revealing little ourselves.
那麼，為了明天做準備，今天就早點睡吧。=Then to prepare for tomorrow, \nwe should all get some rest early tonight.

Chapter 4 Velvet Room 1
----------
抱歉在您就寢時打擾您。=My apologies for disturbing your sleep.
{{A}}……\n你的慾望似乎磨煉得很順利啊。={{A}}... It looks like your strengthening of desire is going well.
至此，你已經讓4位{{A}}改心了。\n「{{B}}」「{{C}}」「{{D}}」「{{E}}」……=You've changed the hearts of 4 {{A}}s. "{{B}}", "{{C}}", "{{D}}", "{{E}}"...
你出色的表現，值得稱讚。=Once again, I commend you for your outstanding performance.
然後……\n這次你似乎也已經瞄準了某個{{A}}呢。=And this time... you seem to have targeted a certain {{A}}.
某個{{A}}？=Certain {{A}}?
是指{{A}}嗎？=You mean {{A}}?
莫非是說{{A}}？=Could it be {{A}}?
{{A}}……如果你心裡有線索了，\n那麼也許就是那個人。={{A}}... If you have any idea, \nit might be that person.
不過，你自己……\n似乎還懷有某種不可思議的情感啊？=But you... still seem to have some mysterious feelings about yourself.
不可思議的情感……？=Mysterious feelings...?
{{B}}指的是這次的目標，\n以及過去由您改心的那些人物。=The {{B}} is referring to the current target as well as people who hearts you have changed in the past.
我能聽到你內心深處的「聲音」……=I can hear a "voice" deep within your heart...
你心裡在想，自己使之改心的對象，\n「真的是惡嗎」。=Were the people who hearts I've changed \n"truly evil"?
{{A}}、{{B}}、{{C}}、{{D}}，\n還有這次的目標：{{E}}……={{A}}, {{B}}, {{C}}, {{D}}, and the current target: {{E}}...
被他這麼一說，\n的確總有一種「違和感」……=After hearing what he said, there's indeed a "strange feeling"...
說起來，\n為什麼「能看到」那些景象呢……=Come to think of it, why can I "see" those scenes...
難道說，自己使之改心的對象，\n其實是更殘忍的惡人……？=Could it be... that the one I tried to reform was actually an even crueler villain...?
{{A}}……\n看來你已經有一些頭緒了。={{A}}... \nIt seems like you have something on your mind.
那麼，我問你個問題吧。=Let me just ask one question.
原本這些{{A}}可能持有的「惡意」，\n會讓他們變成更令人厭惡的模樣……=The malice within the {{A}}s transforms them into hideous forms...
但如果以某件事為起點，惡意逐漸減少，\n你覺得他們的模樣會如何變化？=If something becomes the starting point and the malice fades away, what do you think their shape will be?
會弱化？=Will weaken?
會消失？=Will disappear?
會變回人類？=Will become human?
{{A}}，很好的著眼點。={{A}}, a very good point of view.
{{A}}，這個想法很有意思……={{A}}, an interesting idea...
如果失去了原本的惡意，\n令人厭惡的模樣自然也會化為虛弱的形態。=If they lose their original malicious intent, their hideous form will naturally transform into a weakened state.
但反之，\n如果他們依然保有「原本的惡意」……=Then again, \nif they had retained their "original malice"...
也許你們會造成眾多犧牲者的出現。=Perhaps you would have caused numerous casualties.
眾多犧牲者……？=Numerous casualties...?
是指我的同伴嗎？=<size\=28>You mean my teammates?</size>
變成那樣的起點是指？=<size\=24>Something becomes the starting point?</size>
剛剛的是……！=That was...!
r:"^(.*)，(.*)大人的負擔，\n如果繼續增加的話……$"="$1, if the burden on $2-sama continues..."
……嚯，還真少見。\n身為隨從，你竟然敢打斷我說話……=...Oh, this is unusual. As an assistant, I can't believe you're interrupting me...
……哦，還真少見。\n身為隨從，你竟然敢打斷我說話……=...Oh, this is unusual. As an assistant, I can't believe you're interrupting me...
但是，身為他的{{A}}，\n你的話我也不能置之不理啊。=But, as his {{A}}, \nI can't ignore what you say.
很期待和他的再會。\n現在就讓他做個好夢吧。=I look forward to our next meeting. \nSweet dreams.

Chapter 4 Part 2 Day 3
----------
腦袋好暈。\n感覺像剛經歷了劇烈的頭痛……=My head feels dizzy. Like I just had a terrible headache...
必須集中精神。\n今天還約了{{A}}……=I need to focus. I have that meeting with {{A}} today...
那麼……！\n你說今天要告訴我{{A}}的事情！=So...! You promised to tell me about the {{A}} today!
{{B}}，{{A}}……我可太期待了。\n昨天太激動了，都沒怎麼睡著呢。={{B}}, {{A}}... I've been looking forward to this. Could barely sleep last night from excitement.
還請手下留情……=Please go easy on me...
你身體沒事了嗎？=Are you feeling better?
隨便問=Ask away
嗯，沒事啦。因為能拿到素材反而十分興奮，\n所以身體狀況超好的，不用擔心。=Yeah, I'm fine. Getting all these references has me so pumped I feel amazing, don't worry.
我想想啊，首先我想問的是……=Let me think, first question...
是「改心的方法」……！\n你們是怎麼改變人心的呢？=About your "change of heart method"...! \nHow exactly do you change people's hearts?
商業機密=Trade secret
你猜猜看=Take a guess
超能力=Superpowers
Choice 1
{{A}}？\n不是說好了要講{{B}}的事嗎？=Eh? We agreed you'd talk about the {{B}}!
商業機密什麼的，那可沒法繼續啦……！="Trade secret" means we can't continue...!
Choice 2
如果我能猜得到，\n那就不會特意跑來問你啦……=If I could guess, \nI wouldn't be asking you directly...
別賣關子了，請告訴我！=Don't keep me in suspense, please tell me!
Choice 3
不是……這又不是漫畫……=This isn't some manga...
別打馬虎眼，請認真地回答我！=Stop evading and answer seriously!
嗯……可能是我一下子就問得太核心了吧。\n那就換個問題……=Hmm... maybe I started too direct.\nLet me change the question...
你們是怎麼選擇目標的？=How do you select your targets?
抓鬮=Draw lots
憑感覺=Go by instinct
Choice 1
怎麼這樣啊！\n你就告訴我吧……！=Come on! Just tell me...!
Choice 2
那是不可能的吧……\n難道說，你在耍我？=That can't be true... \nAre you messing with me?
Choice 3
就是……跟著感覺走？\n我總覺得肯定不是這樣的……=Just... following your instincts? \nI refuse to believe it's that simple...
{{A}}……真沒辦法。\n那麼，下一個問題……={{A}}... It can't be helped. \nNext question then...
真是的，明明是你主動提出要說的，\n結果根本不正面回答我的任何問題嘛……！=Honestly, you offered to talk, \nbut won't properly answer anything...!
嗯，到底問什麼你才會回答呢……\n還想問的是……=Hmm, what would make you actually respond... \nLet me think...
為什麼對怪盜這麼執著？=<size\=21>Why this obsession with Phantom Thieves?</size>
你喜歡怪盜嗎？=<size\=25>Do you like Phantom Thieves?</size>
Choice 1
{{A}}？與其說執著……={{A}}? Rather than obsession...
畢竟現實中出現了一群人，\n做著跟漫畫裡一樣的事情啊。=It's more that real people are doing what only existed in manga before.
作為漫畫家，我當然會在意了。=As a manga artist, of course I'm curious.
Choice 2
{{A}}？嗯……我想想啊。\n是……喜歡嗎……={{A}}? Hmm... let me think. \nDo I... like them?
不管怎麼說，畢竟現實中出現了一群人，\n做著跟漫畫裡一樣的事情啊。=Regardless, it's more that real people are doing what only existed in manga before.
r:"^我才想問(.*){{A}}，\n你為什麼當上了怪盜呢？$"="I wanted to ask you, $1-senpai, why did you become a Phantom Thief?"
應該不是……為了賺錢吧。\n讓壞人改心，對你來說有什麼好處呢？=Surely not... for money? \nWhat benefit is there in changing villains' hearts?
想拯救那些受苦的人=<size\=30>To save suffering people</size>
{{A}}不可饒恕=<size\=30>{{A}} is unforgivable</size>
想改變世界=To change the world
意思是……為了正義？=Meaning... for justice?
世界……這話說得可真大啊。\n也就是說，是為了正義嗎？=The world... quite the grand statement. \nSo it's about justice then?
……真的嗎？=...Really?
至今為止，{{B}}改心過的人，\n有原棒球選手{{A}}……=So far, the {{B} has changed the hearts of ex-baseball player {{A}}...
原美食網紅{{A}}……\n曾經是{{C}}教師的{{B}}……=Ex-celebrity critic {{A}}... \nEx-{{C}} teacher {{B}}...
與大家有個人關係的也就{{A}}了。=Only {{A}} had personal connections.
這麼想的話，\n說為了正義也不見得是假話……=Thinking that way, \nthe "for justice" claim might hold truth...
其實我們認識被害人=We knew the victims
其實所有人都是有關係的=All were connected somehow
{{A}}，是這樣嗎？\n那這件事我晚點再詳細問……={{A}}, is that so? \nI'll ask details later...
那也就是說，\n至今都是「出於個人恩怨讓他們改心的」？=So you mean... All your change of hearts so far were "personal grudges"?
不是那樣的=It's not like that
因為還有其他受苦的人=Others were suffering too
……你的意思是，\n不是出於個人恩怨，其實是為了正義？=...So you're saying it wasn't personal, \nbut for justice?
感覺難以置信嗎？=Hard to believe?
我沒有說謊=I'm not lying
……說實話，我很難相信。\n我不覺得你們當怪盜只是單純地為了正義。=...Honestly, I can't buy it. \nPure justice can't be your only motive.
因為職業關係，\n我查過那些被稱為英雄或者義賊的人……=Professionally, I've researched so-called heroes and vigilantes...
大家多少都有自私的一面，有的時候，\n那些英雄行為終究也都是為了自己。=They all had selfish sides, \neven heroic acts ultimately served themselves.
為了追求純粹的正義而行動……\n現實中不可能有那種漫畫角色存在。=Purely selfless justice... \nNo real person acts like manga characters.
漫畫角色？=Manga characters?
比如{{A}}？=<size\=24>Like {{A}}?</size>
沒錯。自己沒有任何好處，\n只是為了別人而付出，簡直是天方夜譚。=Exactly. Gaining nothing yourself, \njust giving to others? Fantasy.
{{A}}的{{B}}們也一樣，\n最開始是為了家人的幸福而戰……=The {{A}}'s protagonists first fought for their family's happiness...
之後才逐漸投身於保護世界的大戰之中。=Only later protecting the world.
然後，他們不知道從什麼時候開始，\n即使捨棄自己的幸福，也要讓別人幸福……=Eventually they reached the point of sacrificing their own happiness for others...
但那些畢竟都是……漫畫裡的故事。\n現實中怎麼會有那種人……=But that's... just manga. \nReal people don't...
就算是{{A}}的{{B}}們，\n最開始也是為了家人的幸福而戰的。=Even the {{A}}'s protagonists first fought for their family's happiness.
之後才逐漸投身於保護世界的大戰之中……=Only later protecting the world...
雖然他們後來變得即使捨棄自己的幸福，\n也要讓別人幸福……=Eventually they reached the point of sacrificing their own happiness for others...
你姐姐就是那樣的人嗎？=Is your sister like that?
聽說你姐姐是漫畫的原型=<size\=26>I heard she's based on your sister</size>
……姐姐？=...Sister?
你在說誰？=Who are you talking about?
{{A}}的{{B}}，\n是以我姐姐為原型的……？=The {{A}}'s protagonist is based on my sister...?
我怎麼不知道……？\n是誰跟你說的？=Why didn't I know...? \nWho told you that?
我根本就沒有姐姐啊。=I don't have a sister.
跟{{A}}和{{B}}說的對不上。\n但{{C}}看上去也不像在說謊……=This contradicts what {{A}} and {{B}} said. But {{C}} seems genuine...
到底是怎麼回事呢……=What's going on...
不過，如果你們真是為了正義在行動……=Still, if you guys truly act for justice...
我就對{{A}}更感興趣了。=My interest in the {{A}} just grew.
為什麼對{{A}}如此感興趣？=Why this deep interest?
你對{{A}}感興趣的理由是？=<size\=25>What's your real reason for being interested?</size>
{{A}}……？\n只是因為我想要一些漫畫的素材……={{A}}...? \nI just needed manga reference...
真的只是那樣嗎？=Really only that?
是不是還有其他理由？=Any other reason?
{{A}}……什麼意思？={{A}}... What do you mean?
比如說，你想讓哪個人改心=<size\=27>Want someone's heart changed?</size>
比如說，有什麼事要拜託我們=Need our help on something?
才、才不是呢。\n我可沒想過要讓誰改心……=Th-That's not it! \nI'd never even think of changing someone's...
……啊、{{A}}！=...Ah, {{A}}!
頭……好疼……=Head... hurts...
沒、事的……\n只不過又有點頭疼而已……=I-It's nothing... \nJust another headache...
也許是昨晚思考要問你的問題，\n想得太晚了……=Probably stayed up too late planning these questions...
今天還是回去吧=Let's head back today
我隨時都會回答你的問題=I can answer anytime
可是，機會難得……=But this chance...
Choice 1
……{{A}}，也行。\n我這個狀態，感覺沒法好好取材、了……=...{{A}}, right. In this state, \nI can't focus properly...
對不起……\n下次能再抽出點時間給我嗎？=Sorry... \nCould we continue another time?
Choice 2
是、嗎……？=Really...?
的確，我這個狀態，\n已經沒辦法好好取材了、吧……=You're right, in this state, \nI can't focus properly...
那我就恭敬不如從命，今天先回去了……\n下次請絕對要再抽出時間給我哦……！=I'll take my leave then. \nBut we absolutely must continue later...!
送到這裡就行了。\n我的頭基本不疼了。=No need to escort me. \nThe headache's mostly gone.
那麼，剩下的請下次再告訴我。\n我先告辭了……=We'll continue next time. \nExcuse me...
那個……有一點我想聲明一下，\n我真的只是想幫助{{A}}。=One last thing, \nI truly only want to help the {{A}}.
我絕對不會妨礙你們，或者揭露誰的身份，\n請相信我……=I'd never interfere or expose anyone. \nPlease believe me...
那麼，我告辭了。=Then, I'll be going.
算是大致問過話了……\n你怎麼看？=We've finished questioning her... \nWhat's your assessment?
我覺得她沒撒謊=<size\=30>I don't think she's lying</size>
我相信她不是敵人=<size\=26>I believe she's not an enemy</size>
是啊……\n吾也覺得{{A}}說的不像假話。=Indeed... Nothing in {{A}}'s demeanor suggested deception.
雖然還不能完全排除嫌疑……=Though we can't dismiss her as a suspect entirely...
優先對付{{A}}吧=<size\=29>Let's prioritize {{A}}</size>
不至於讓我們停止攻略{{A}}了=No need to halt {{A}} infiltration
唔，是啊。\n也不能一直拖著{{A}}的事情不管。=Hmm, right. \nWe can't keep delaying the {{A}} matter.
那就發訊息聯繫一下大家，\n從明天起，重新開始攻略{{A}}吧。=Let's message everyone, \nwe'll resume {{A}} infiltration starting tomorrow.

Chapter 4 Part 2 Day 4
----------
在學校門口交談=Talk at the school gate
今天也真是場……相當熾熱的演出呢。=That was quite... a blazing performance today.
回家之前去一趟「黃昏之遊戲場」，\n在那裡交流一下演戲心得……大家意向如何？=Before heading home, how about we visit the "Twilight Playground" to exchange acting insights?
黃昏之……啥？=Twilight... what?
……他說的大概是夕陽西下的公園吧。=...He probably means the park at sunset.
我只是單純好奇，\n你為什麼每次都要特意換個說法呢……=I'm just curious why you always phrase things so unusually...
{{B}}，不過交流心得這個主意很不錯啊！\n……{{A}}。={{B}}, but sharing insights sounds great! \n...{{A}}.
我去，{{A}}……！=Oh crap, {{A}}...!
你怎麼了，{{A}}？=What's wrong, {{A}}?
啊……似乎有客人找我。抱歉啊，\n等下次再交流心得吧。你們先回去吧。=Ah... seems I have a customer. My apologies, let's share insights next time. You all go ahead.
客人……？啊，又是工作上的事嗎？=A customer...? \nAh, is it work-related again?
差不多吧。但我會回絕的，你就放心吧。\n我可沒打算接那些多餘的工作。=Something like that. But I'll decline, don't worry. I'm not taking any extra jobs.
好，我知道了。那麼再見啦，{{A}}。\n大家也再見。=Understood. See you later, {{A}}.\nEveryone, goodbye.
r:"^(.*){{A}}不回去嗎？\n那我也……$"="$1-senpai and the others aren't leaving? Then I'll..."
現在還沒到「那個時候」……=It's not "that time" yet...
「命運」的交叉點還沒到來……=<size\=27>Our "destined" crossroads remain ahead...</size>
……原來是這麼回事嗎……！=...I see...!
好吧。\n看來現在還輪不到我登場呢。=Very well. \nIt seems my moment hasn't come.
不過，如果有需要，請隨時叫我。\n同為「{{A}}」，我會鼎力相助的。=But if needed, call upon me anytime. As a fellow "{{A}}", I'll lend my full support.
那麼，我告辭了。祝你們好運！=Then I take my leave. Best of luck!
r:"^……(.*)一跟(.*)說話，\n就變得有點奇怪吧？$"="...$1 acts strangely when talking to $2, no?"
{{A}}也最好先回去吧。={{A}}, you should head back too.
不，那位叫{{A}}的女士，\n也是我的取材對象，所以不用管我……！=No, that {{A}} woman is also a reference, \nso don't mind me...!
那麼……走吧。=Then... let's go.

今天找我有何貴幹，{{A}}。=What brings you today, {{A}}.
你說話別那麼彆扭嘛。=No need to be so stiff.
之前突然找你約戲，嚇了你一跳吧。\n而且我還發那麼大火……抱歉啊。=My sudden casting offer must have shocked you. \nAnd my outburst... my apologies.
哦……=Oh...
今天我有個好消息哦，{{A}}。=I bring good news today, {{A}}.
不必了。我已經決定，\n今年要全身心參與戲劇部的活動了。=That won't be necessary. I've decided to devote myself fully to the drama club this year.
你又說這麼幼稚的話……\n那我就更不能丟下你不管了啊。=Such childish talk... \nAll the more reason I can't abandon you.
我說啊，{{A}}……\n你，換個經紀公司吧。=Listen, {{A}}... \nYou should transfer agencies.
哈……？=Hah...?
怎麼突然說這個？換個經紀公司？=Why suddenly suggest that? \nTransfering agencies?
有家跟我關係很好的經紀公司，\n叫「BEAUTIFUL HIGH」。=There's an agency I'm close with, \nit's called "BEAUTIFUL HIGH".
你簽那家的話，可以優先給你好工作，\n還能好好保護你呢。=Sign with them and you'll get priority roles and proper protection.
就讓我親手把你打造成真正的明星吧。=Let me personally mold you into a true star.
不、不必了。我對現在的公司挺滿意的，\n沒理由要換……=N-No thanks. I'm satisfied with my current agency. There's no reason to transfer...
有理由的哦。=There is a reason.
……你不想與我為敵吧？=...You don't want me as an enemy, do you?
這是在……威脅我嗎？=Is that... a threat?
威脅什麼的，這話有點過分了啊。=Calling that a threat seems a bit much, don't you think?
威脅什麼的，這話有點過分了呀。=Calling that a threat seems a bit much, don't you think?
我只是說，你換了經紀公司，\n我就可以更好地保護你啦。=All I'm saying is, if you transfer agencies, \nI can properly protect you.
來，快說。\n說「我要加入BEAUTIFUL HIGH」。=Now, say it. \nSay "I want to join BEAUTIFUL HIGH".
只要這一句話，你的前途就會一片光明……=Just those words will brighten your future...
喂，幹、幹什麼啊，{{A}}！=Hey, wh-what are you doing, {{A}}!?
討厭，開不了了……！=Damn it, it won't turn on...!
損壞財產！\n你這是損壞他人財產，{{A}}！=Property damage! \nThis is willful destruction of property, {{A}}!
都怪你硬把麥克風塞過來=You forced the mic over
你的行為也屬於暴行=<size\=25>Your actions qualify as assault</size>
r:"^算了，(.*)。\n我剛才的確做過頭了……我會賠償的。$"="Forget it, $1. \nI went too far... I'll compensate."
這可買不到一模一樣的！=You can't purchase this exact one!
這支錄音筆很重要的！\n它充滿了我跟那個人的回憶啊！=This voice recorder is precious! \nIt's full of memories with that person!
修理！=Repair!
快拿去修理！=Get it repaired! Now!
修這個嗎？但它已經是很老的機型了，\n還是買個新的更好……=Repair this? But it's an old model, \nbetter to buy a new one...
而且錄音功能的話，\n手機也有……=Besides, smartphones can record too...
囉嗦死了，你是在命令我嗎！？\n廢話少說，快拿去修理！！=Shut up! Are you giving me orders!? \nShut up and get it repaired!!
是、是！=Y-Yes!
那、那個，{{A}}……=U-Um, {{A}}...
{{A}}～～～～={{A}}～～～～
今天就算了。\n你也需要些時間考慮吧，{{A}}。=Let's end today. \nYou need time to consider, {{A}}.
不，我不需要考慮……=No, I don't need to consider...
我想想啊，嗯……\n你在{{A}}的學園祭前回覆我就好。=Let's see, hmm... \nReply before the {{A}} school festival.
我想想啊，嗯……\n你在{{A}}的學園祭前回復我就好。=Let's see, hmm... \nReply before the {{A}} school festival.
那可能是你在高中最後的舞臺了，\n我還是讓你好好享受一下吧。=This is possible your final high school stage, \nI'll let you enjoy it properly.
哈！？=Hah!?
難道不是嗎？等你換公司了，\n我是不會讓你再參加高中戲劇活動的……=Isn't that obvious? After transferring, \nI won't permit amateur theatrics...
你要是拒絕換的話，\n連你的演員生涯也會……你懂的吧？=Decline this offer, and your precious acting career... suffice to say, you know what comes next?
哎呀，你別露出那副表情啦。\n我可一直都是為了你好呀。=Ara, don't make that face. \nI only want what's best for you.
所以別讓我失望哦，{{A}}。=Do not disappoint me, {{A}}.
請等一下！\n我可沒打算換經紀公司……！=Wait! \nI have no intention of transfering agencies...!
……{{A}}，真是的！\n根本不聽人說話！=...{{A}}, come on! \nThis person never listens!
你直接無視那種邀請就好了。\n根本沒必要每次都搭理她。=Just ignore these offers. \nNo need to engage her every time.
她剛才說要等到學園祭當天聽你的答覆吧。=She said she'll wait until the festival, right?
那麼，在那天之前，\n{{A}}應該不會採取什麼行動了吧？=Then until then, {{A}} likely won't act?
嗯，她應該明白，如果這時對{{A}}父母出手，\n只會把{{A}}推得更遠吧……=Right. Attacking {{A}}'s parents now would only push {{A}} away...
所以到學園祭當天為止，我們還有時間。\n最好在那之前讓她改心吧。=So we have until the festival. \nBest change her heart before then.
嗯。雖然時間不多，事情也很棘手，\n但目前還是以此為目標吧。=Agreed. Time's tight, and it's a tough task, \nbut let's make it our current goal.
不過……看來那支錄音筆，\n對{{A}}來說是很重要的東西呢。=Still... that voice recorder seemed precious to {{A}}.
是啊。她突然發火，嚇了我一跳。\n果然認知世界的那根魔法棒就是……=Yeah, her outburst shocked me. That magic wand in the cognitive world must be...
……認知世界？=...Cognitive world?
啊……{{A}}，剛才說得不對……！\n該怎麼說呢……=Ah... {{A}}, that's not right...!\nHow to explain...
唔……是你們{{A}}的活動中，\n不能告訴我的那部分嗎？=Hmm... Is this {{A}} business you can't share?
話說，莫非{{A}}也是{{B}}的一員？=Wait, is {{A}} also a member of the {{B}}?
哈……？你怎麼會知道的！？=Hah...? How'd you know!?
怎麼知道的……你就給我那種感覺啊。\n即使聽到認知世界這個詞，也沒任何反應……=How...? You gave off the vibe. \nNo reaction to cognitive world...
啊～瞞著你也沒意義了吧。\n反正其他人都暴露了。=Ah～ No point hiding. \nEveryone else is exposed anyway.
你猜對了，我也是他們的夥伴。\n而且我也聽說了，你想要幫助我們。=Correct, I'm their ally. \nAnd I heard you want to help us.
是、這樣啊……我有點吃驚。=I... see. I'm surprised.
也就是說，{{B}}會成為你們的目標，\n就是因為{{A}}被她盯上了……對嗎？=That means, {{B}} became a target because she's harassing {{A}}...?
無可奉告……=No comment...
任由你想像=Use your imagination
唔……又來這一招嗎……\n不過既然是秘密，那我就不打聽了。=Hmm... this again? \nBut I won't pry into secrets.
嗯，謝謝你能理解，\n我們也有「不能說的秘密」。=Thanks for understanding. \nWe have "unshareable secrets".
話說，從剛才開始我就有點在意……=Speaking of, something's been bugging me...
{{A}}說的那個「BIUBIU HIHI」，\n是家很厲害的公司嗎？=That "BIUBIU HIHI" {{A}} mentioned, \nis it a big company?
……是「BEAUTIFUL HIGH」。=...It's "BEAUTIFUL HIGH".
我一個詞都沒說對啊！！=I got every syllable wrong!!
「BEAUTIFUL HIGH」這個名字，\n我也聽說過。=I've heard of "BEAUTIFUL HIGH".
好像是個小規模公司，\n聚集了很多年輕男演員和偶像。=It's a small agency with many young male actors and idols.
應該並沒有什麼很強的優勢……=It's not particularly powerful...
說到底，為什麼雜誌社的主編，\n會為一家經紀公司牽線搭橋？=Right, why would a magazine editor-in-chief promote a talent agency?
的確是啊……\n這種事常有嗎？=True... \nDoes this happen often?
不。因為工作原因或者關係好，\n可能偶爾會幫忙介紹一些經紀公司……=No. Sometimes introductions happen for work reasons...
但聽她剛才的說法，\n就像是在說她自己的公司呢。=But her tone suggested she owns the company.
會不會和{{A}}有什麼聯繫？\n不過我也沒聽說過就是了……=Maybe it's connected to {{A}}? \nThough I've heard nothing...
如果大家想知道，就讓我來調查一下吧？=If everyone wants to know, \nthen let me to investigate?
{{A}}？可以嗎……？={{A}}? Is this okay...?
可以的。我和之前那個{{A}}的編輯……\n還需要校對後續採訪內容什麼的。=Yes. That {{A}} editor... \nWe have follow-up interviews anyway.
雖然不知道他是否了解情況，\n但起碼還是可以打聽看看吧？=I'm not sure if he's aware of the situation, \nbut it's worth asking, right?
那就拜託你了！=Then I'll count on you!
好的，我知道了。\n請交給我吧。=Understood. \nPlease leave it to me.
不，可是……=No, but...
你們還在懷疑我嗎？我說過的吧，\n我是真心想幫{{A}}的。=Do you still distrust me? I said I genuinely want to help the {{A}}.
而且請大家想想，\n假如我真的向{{A}}揭露大家的身份……=Think about this, if I exposed you to {{A}}...
告訴他，其實你們要陷害{{A}}，\n你們覺得他會信嗎？=And told him you're targeting {{A}}, \nwould you think he'll believe me?
是啊……猜來猜去也沒有意義……=Right... It's pointless to speculate...
就下定決心，交給她吧。=Then it's decided, let's leave it to her.
嗯，我知道了。既然隊長跟{{B}}都這麼說，\n那我也相信{{A}}。=Alright. Since the leader and {{B}} say so, \nI'll believe in {{A}} too.
非常感謝。=Thank you so much.
沒錯，請交給我吧。=Alright, leave it to me.
那我就先回去了。=Then I'll head back first.
{{A}}，不跟我們一起去車站嗎？={{A}}, you're not coming to the station with us?
如果你們開作戰會議的話，\n有的話不方便當著我的面說吧……=If you're planning strategy, \nsome topics need privacy...
謝謝你想得這麼周到=<size\=26>Thanks for being considerate</size>
可別悄悄偷聽哦=No eavesdropping
沒事，我期待大家的精彩表現。\n請一定要為我提供些好素材哦。=No problem, I look forward to your performance. \nDo provide good references.
那麼，我就先告辭了。=Then, I'll take my leave.
如果我有這個打算，\n就不會特意說這些引起你們的戒心了……=If I meant harm, \nI wouldn't warn you to be cautious...
我期待大家的精彩表現。\n請一定要為我提供些好素材哦。=I look forward to your performance. \nDo provide good references.
{{A}}果然是個好孩子啊……！={{A}} really is a good kid...!
是啊。如果她真的能幫忙對{{A}}改心，\n就沒有比這更可靠的幫手了。=Yes. If she helps change {{A}}'s heart, \nwe couldn't ask for better support.
r:"^嗯。吾和(.*)昨天也和她談過了，\n覺得可以暫時對她放下警戒。$"="Mhm. $1 and I spoke with her yesterday, \nwe can lower our guard temporarily."
跟昨晚和大家聯絡時說的一樣，\n從今天起，吾等重新開始探索{{A}}吧。=As messaged yesterday, \nwe resume {{A}} infiltration today.
好嘞！\n那就馬上去{{A}}吧！=Alright! Let's go to {{A}} now!

{{A}}？是剛才那位！？\n他不是去修錄音筆先走了嗎……={{A}}? The one from earlier!? \nDidn't he leave to repair the voice recorder...?
啊，你說這個吧。\n我這就拿去{{A}}。不過……=Ah, this? I'm taking it to {{A}}. But...
多虧了這個，我才能暫時抽身。\n我一直在等你呢，{{A}}。=Thanks to this, it gave me an excuse to wait. \nI wanted to talk, {{A}}.
{{A}}……我也有話跟你說。={{A}}... I have questions too.
你為什麼要給{{A}}那種人工作呢……？=Why work for someone like {{A}}...?
……說來話長啊。=...It's a long story.
我說，很抱歉打斷你們。\n這位秘書是{{A}}的熟人嗎？=Hey, sorry for the interruption. \nYou know this secretary, {{A}}?
嗯。這位是{{A}}。\n我還是童星的時候就跟他一起演過電視劇。=Yes. This is {{A}}. We acted together on TV when I was a child star.
他不僅是才華橫溢的演員，\n還很擅長唱歌跳舞，在偶像界也活躍過。=He's a brilliant actor who also excelled in singing and dancing, he was an idol too.
也就是說……這位也是藝人！？\n我就覺得他很有那種氣場……！=So... he's a celebrity!? \nThat explains his aura...!
為什麼他這樣的人，\n要給{{A}}賣命啊？=Why would someone like him serve {{A}}?
請回答我，{{A}}。\n電視上也看不到你了，我還在想怎麼回事……=Please answer me, {{A}}. You've disappeared from TV too... I've been wondering what happened...
你為什麼要聽那種傢伙的使喚啊？\n你已經不唱歌了嗎！？=Why obey someone like that? \nHave you quit singing!?
……我的事情先不說了。=...My story can wait.
比起這個，我想說你的事。\n你聽好了，{{A}}。你別跟{{B}}對著幹。=More importantly, listen carefully, {{A}}. \nDon't oppose {{B}}.
經紀公司還是換了的好。\n這是為你著想。=Transfer agencies. \nIt's for your own good.
你在說什麼啊……？\n我不會向那種人屈服的！=What are you talking about...? \nI won't submit to her!
我已經不會再對自己說謊了。=I won't lie to myself anymore.
臉上帶著假笑，做著自己不想做的工作……\n那種事我再也不幹了！=Faking smiles, doing unwanted jobs... \nNever again!
娛樂圈可沒有那麼天真……！=The industry isn't so naive...!
你聽好，{{A}}。現在我在儘量拖延時間，\n不讓那些報導刊登，但也快到極限了。=Listen, {{A}}. I've delayed those articles, \nbut I can't hold out much longer.
一旦被那個人盯上……不是服從，\n就是被毀掉，只有這兩個選擇啊……！=Once she targets someone... \nonly submission or ruin remains!
你說的根本就……！=That's...!
你不這麼想對吧。但現實就是如此。\n已經有數不過來的藝人都被她毀了。=You disagree? But that's reality. \nCountless careers ended this way.
……{{A}}也是其中之一嗎？=...Is {{A}} one of them too?
我剛才說了，別管我的事。=I said leave me out of this.
那個人對你相當執著。\n只要不激怒她……你就能一直當她的心頭好。=She's obsessed with you. If you don't provoke her... you'll remain her favorite.
那個人對你相當執著。\n只要不激怒她……你就能一直當她的珍寶。=She's obsessed with you. If you don't provoke her... you'll remain her favorite.
「她的心頭好」，開什麼玩笑。\n而且，我也沒打算被她毀掉。="Her favorite"? Is this a joke? \nAnd no, I won't be ruined.
「她的珍寶」，開什麼玩笑。\n而且，我也沒打算被她毀掉。="Her favorite"? Is this a joke? \nAnd no, I won't be ruined.
不，你會被毀掉的。\n你父母也差不多算是被那個人毀掉的。=Yes, you will. \nYour parents nearly were.
說話也講究下方式方法吧！=Phrase that better!
多少體諒下{{A}}的心情吧！=<size\=29>Consider {{A}}'s feelings!</size>
……的確，我說話太衝了。抱歉。\n可是……這就是事實。=...True. I spoke harshly. Apologies. \nBut... these are facts.
即使你不願意……只要服從那個人，\n就能留在娛樂圈，也能繼續當演員。=Even if you don't want to... \nSubmit, and you can stay in the industry.
你想繼續當演員吧？\n那就別走錯了路啊，{{A}}……！=You want to keep acting, right? \nThen don't stray, {{A}}...!
……我可是提醒過你了。=...I've warned you.
請等一下，{{A}}……！=Please wait, {{A}}...!
你真的心甘情願嗎！？\n你已經放棄了偶像的夢想嗎！？=Are you truly content!? \nHave you abandoned your idol dreams!?
雖然我完全不同意他說的話……\n但那個人，好像還挺真誠的啊。=While I disagree with him... \nhe seemed sincere.
而且，{{A}}父母的報導一直沒刊登，\n難道也是他的功勞嗎……？=And the articles about {{A}}'s parents were never published... was that his doing too?
也許吧。不過，他看起來是個很堅定的人，\n為什麼會向{{A}}投降呢……=Maybe. But he seems so strong-willed, \nwhy would he yield to {{A}}...
似乎有隱情=There's more to it
的確不像壞人=<size\=23>Doesn't seem like a bad person</size>
對啊。感覺他是真的在為{{A}}著想，\n才說得出那些話。=Right. He genuinely seemed concerned for {{A}}'s sake.
唔。也許是因為被{{A}}不斷剝奪慾望，\n才變成如今那副狀態了吧。=Hmm. Perhaps {{A}} stole his desires until he ended up like that.
既然這樣，\n就讓我來奪回{{A}}的慾望。=In this case, \nI'll take back {{A}}'s stolen desires.
走吧，隊長。\n去{{A}}！=Let's go, Leader. \nTo {{A}}!
附近沒看到{{A}}的蹤影。\n應該沒問題吧。=No sign of {{A}} nearby. \nWe should be fine.
好，那就走吧！=Alright, let's go!

----------
Chapter 4 Part 2 Day 3 Palace Part 1
----------
那麼，就朝{{A}}的更高層出發吧！=Let's head to the upper levels of {{A}}!
這地方還是老樣子，又花俏又浮誇。\n噁心得讓人想吐。=This place remains as gaudy and ostentatious as ever. It makes me sick.
這地方還是老樣子，又花哨又浮誇。\n噁心得讓人想吐。=This place remains as gaudy and ostentatious as ever. It makes me sick.
{{A}}呈現出塔的形狀，估計是因為……\n她覺得自己在任何人面前都是高高在上的吧。=The {{A}} taking a tower form likely represents... how she views herself as superior to everyone.
那可真是{{A}}到極點了。\n明明把那麼多人的人生搞得一團亂……！=The height of {{A}}. \nAfter ruining so many lives...!
嗯，絕對要讓那種壞蛋改心！\n打起精神前進吧！=We'll definitely change that villain's heart! \nLet's press onward!
首先去之前碰見{{A}}的地點吧。\n必須找到去上層的方法才行。=First, return to where we encountered {{A}}. We need to find a way up.
嗯？那邊的電梯……\n似乎可以用來移動到上層。=Hmm? That elevator over there... \nseems to access higher floors.
不過，之前那裡不是有陰影嗎？\n怎麼消失了？=But weren't Shadows guarding it before? \nWhere'd they go?
可能是因為LUCE在現實中，\n把{{A}}的錄音筆打掉了。=Probably because Luce broke {{A}}'s voice recorder in reality.
可以理解為，她精神上的動搖，\n說不定也對{{A}}和陰影產生了影響吧……=Her mental instability likely affected the {{A}} and Shadows...
嗯，既然能通行，就沒理由不用了。\n走吧，隊長！=Well, no reason not to proceed. \nLet's go, Leader!
{{A}}……跟下面一層的氣氛完全不一樣啊！\n感覺像是時髦的辦公室？={{A}}... this floor's vibe is totally different from downstairs! It feels like some trendy office?
陰影們都在伏案工作呢。\n這是……對{{A}}的印象吧。=The Shadows are all working at desks.\nThis must be how she sees {{A}}.
這些打工人似乎對吾等沒有絲毫興趣呢。=These workers show zero interest in us.
{{A}}的氣息……\n果然是從這座塔的上方傳來的。=The {{A}}'s presence... \nit's definitely coming from the top.
探索一下這一層，\n然後找到去上面的路吧。=Let's explore this floor and locate the upward path.

----------
Chapter 4 Part 2 Day 3 Palace Exploration
----------
這裡的螞蟻陰影也在拼命工作呢……\n大家看起來都好辛苦啊。=Even the ant Shadows are working hard... They look exhausted.
現實中的公司職員大概也是這種感覺吧……\n必須儘快讓{{A}}改心，救救大家。=We must change {{A}}'s heart and save everyone.
嗯……為了達成這個目標，\n首先找到通往上層的路吧。=Mhm... To do that, first find a way up.
開始探索吧，WONDER。\n話說回來，這附近的氛圍……=Let's explore, Wonder. The vibe nearby...
嗯…… 雖然說不太清楚，\n但總覺得有點奇怪呢。=Right... This place feels... off. I'm not sure why.
又出現了{{A}}的畫！\n不過和之前見過的好像不太一樣……？=A {{A}} portrait again! But this seems different from what we've seen before...?
說不定效果也不同。\n試試看吧，WONDER。=Perhaps the effect is also different. \nLet's try it, Wonder.
噢…… 確實和之前的形態不一樣。\n看起來好像更強一些吧？=Oh... It's different than the previous form. \nWe look stronger?
像是……上級職員的感覺。\n這樣的話，能去的地方可能會變多……=It feels like... a senior employee. \nMaybe with this we can go to more places...
繼續前進看看吧。=Let's keep going and have a look.
辛苦了，請進去吧。=Good work. Please enter.
那邊的門好像開了。\n前進吧，WONDER。=That door's open. \nOnward, Wonder.
{{A}}變回來了！\n難道是踩到了類似顏料的東西嗎？={{A}} Did we step on paint or something?
恐怕是這樣。如果想要維持螞蟻的形態，\n注意別踩到顏料。=I'm afraid so. Watch out for paint if you wish to maintain ant form.
真是的…… 工蟻們一個個真是沒用……\n而且還髒兮兮的。=All the worker ants are useless... \nIt's still dirty.
同感。那種東西根本沒資格見{{A}}。=Agreed. Those being have no right to see {{A}}.
是啊。要是那些傢伙出現了，\n隨便找個理由讓他們滾開好了。=Right. If those guys show up, just find a reason to tell them to get lost.
太過分了…… \n大家明明都那麼拼命工作……=That's terrible... \nEveryone's working so hard...
看來即使同為螞蟻陰影，也存在階級差異呢。\n隨之而來的還有歧視意識……=Even shadow ants have a hierarchy... \nand discrimination follows.
恐怕現實中也有類似的情況吧……\n總之，吾大概知道怎麼通過了。=This probably happens in the real world too... Anyway, I think I've figured out how to get through.
WONDER，找找附近\n有沒有能變身成高職級螞蟻陰影的裝置吧。=Wonder, scout for a device to disguise as a higher-ranking ant Shadow.
似乎要偽裝成高職級螞蟻才能通過……=Seems like I need to disguise myself as a high-ranking ant to pass...
全力守護女王大人！=Protect Her Majesty!
這是什麼？\n這下完全過不去啊！=What's this? \nWe can't get past!
看起來像是石頭做的……\n好像很難推開啊。=It looks like stone... \nBut it's too heavy to move.
平時確實是這樣……不過，要是用這個\n拳套的話，說不定能推動呢。=Normally, yes... But with this glove, \nmaybe we can push it.
有可能。\n馬上試試吧，WONDER。=That's worth a shot. \nTry it, Wonder.
糟糕！變身解除了！=Crap! Our transformation!
不好！這個樣子被敵人發現的話……！=This is bad! If the enemy finds us...!
你們是什麼人！？是入侵者嗎！？=Who are you!? Intruder!?
看來目標是{{A}}啊！？\n在這裡就把你們統統抓起來！=You're targeting {{A}}!? \nCatch them, now!

啊，牆上這個…… 是這一層的地圖嗎？=Ah, on the wall... Is that the map?
範圍挺大的嘛。這裡是印刷室……\n還有…… 演唱會區域？=It's quite a large area. This is the Printing Room... And... the Concert Area?
印刷室倒還能理解……\n為什麼會有演唱會區域呢？=I can understand the Printing Room... \nBut why is there a Concert Area?
誰知道呢…… 不過，有種不好的預感。=Who knows... \nI have a bad feeling about this.
想不明白的事再怎麼想也沒用。\n先專注於確認{{A}}路線吧。=No point agonizing over what we can't understand. For now, let's focus on finding the route to the {{A}}.
青色費洛蒙能量恢復了。=Recovered green pheromones energy.
綠色費洛蒙能量恢復了。=Recovered green pheromones energy.
啊，變身被解除了！=Ah, that lifted the transformation!
大家快看，有藍色的結晶。\n看起來好冷啊……=Look, everyone, there are blue crystals. \nIt looks so cold...
不只是看起來，實際好像也很冷呢。\n旁邊的障礙物都結冰了。=Not just looks, it's freezing. \nEven the barriers are iced over.
不是吧……\n那就是說搬不走嗎？=Seriously... \nSo we can't move them?
不…… 看起來並沒有固定在底座上，\n說不定能搬下來？=Wait... They're not anchored. \nMaybe we can lift them?
唔……試試看吧，WONDER。=Hoom... Let's try it, Wonder.
{{A}}！？　變回來了！\n為什麼呀？　因為碰了水嗎！？={{A}}!?\nWe got changed back! Was that because we touched water!?
恐怕是的。如果想要維持住螞蟻的姿態\n就儘量避開水走吧。=I'm afraid so. Watch out for paint if you wish to maintain ant form.
橙色費洛蒙能量恢復了。=Recovered orange pheromones energy.
切…… 明明在為{{A}}效力，\n連這種事都做不到的無能之輩……=Tch... Useless fools working for {{A}} can't even do this much...
喂！那邊的你們幾個！=Hey, you!
找幾個工蟻來把這裡收拾下！\n這是{{A}}要經過的路！=Get some worker ants to clean this up! \n{{A}} passes here!
你自己做不就行了 =You can do it yourself 
為什麼要我們做？=Why us?
這種雜務才不是我的工作。\n而且我還在忙演唱會的事呢。=This is not my job. \nI've got a concert to prep.
明白了就趕緊把工蟻叫來！\n可不能讓{{A}}看到這副慘狀！=Just call them! \n{{A}} can't see this mess!
看來跟他們無法溝通……\n沒辦法。去找工蟻吧。=...No reasoning with them. \nLet's find the worker ants.
啊，這邊的障礙收進去了，\n那邊的又伸出來了！=Ugh, barriers here retract, but new ones pop out there!
雖然不明白原理…… 但這裡的\n障礙物似乎以某種形式連接著。=I have no idea how... but they must be linked somehow.
哎？這是什麼……？=Huh? What's this...?
確實讓人在意呢…… \n說不定和附近的機關有關聯。=Intriguing... Maybe tied to a nearby mechanism?
唔……去調查一下吧，WONDER。=Hoom... Let's investigate, Wonder.
啊！機關動了！\n難道說，這個是……=Whoa! It moved! Is this...?
原來如此。\n看來用這個就能重置機關啊。=I see. This must reset the mechanisms.
那個…… 打擾一下？\n其實我有點事想拜託一下……=Um... excuse me? \nI need a favor...
啊…… 對、對不起！=Ah... S-sorry!
光想著{{A}}的事……\n完全忘記工作了！=Got distracted thinking about {{A}}... Forgot my job!
是收拾的事對吧！？\n馬上就做！=It's cleanup, right!? \nOn it!
紙箱被收拾好了，\n路可以通過了……=The path's clear now...
按前面的，後面的就會彈出來……\n這樣根本過不去啊。=If we hit the front, the back one pops out... There's no way through.
說不定可以用那個底座。\n找找附近有沒有結晶吧。=Try that base, let's look for nearby crystals.
現在的形態好像推不動……=You can't push these in this form...
對不起，我們馬上讓開！=Sorry, we'll leave immediately!
擋住掌印開關的工蟻們離開了……=The worker ants blocking the button left...
哦，機關恢復原狀了！=Oh, reverted the mechanisms!
不過就算重置，\n被凍住的東西好像並不會恢復原狀……=Even with the reset, it seems like the frozen ones won't revert...
那扇門，好像必須按開關才能打開。=A switch is required to open that door.
現在的形態按不了開關。\n附近有變身裝置嗎？=We can't press it in this form. Any transformation device nearby?
為我們的女王{{A}}～♪\n今天明天都想被您踐踏～♪=All hail Queen {{A}}～♪ \nWe live to serve beneath her feet～♪
…… 喂，你們是入侵者嗎！？=...Hey, are you intruders!?
看來是來被{{A}}踐踏的！\n這種事我可不會允許！=You want to get stepped on by {{A}}? Not on my watch!
總覺得…… 剛才的螞蟻陰影，\n有點奇怪呢……=Those ant Shadows felt... weird.
好像能前往更深的區域了。\n繼續探索吧，WONDER。=Deeper areas unlocked. Let's keep exploring, Wonder.
到上層了呢。\n看來路線是正確的。=We're at the upper level. Seems that was the right path.
到目前為止還算順利。\n繼續前進吧，WONDER。=Things are going well so far, Let's keep going, Wonder.

{{A}}怎麼變回去了！？\n難道是…… 這奇怪霧氣的緣故嗎？={{A}} We got transformed back!? Was it because of that strange fog?
被這裝置噴出的霧氣籠罩的話， \n變身好像會解除……必須想辦法關掉。=That device can break our transformation... We need to shut it down.
啊…… 那是不是之前見過的那種，\n能吸收費洛蒙能量的結晶？=Ah... That crystal absorbs pheromones, right?
好像是呢。不過顏色不一樣。\n說不定能獲得不同的能力哦。=It's the same type but blue. \nMaybe it can give new powers.
果然像是吸收了費洛蒙能量的樣子。 \n顏色是藍色的話……=If the color is blue, then...
嗯……  或許和之前看到的藍色結晶一樣，\n能把東西凍住。=Hoom... Maybe it's like the blue crystals earlier, \nit could freeze things.
藍色費洛蒙能量恢復了。=Recovered blue pheromones energy.
綠色與藍色費洛蒙能量恢復了。=Recovered green and blue pheromones energy.
裝置好像停了。\n這樣應該不會再出霧氣了！=The device stopped. This should stop the mist!
{{A}}？\n路被堵住了…… 怎麼辦。={{A}}? The road's blocked... What should we do?
這玻璃……已經有有裂痕了呢。\n凍住後，說不定會碎掉哦。=This glass... has cracks already. Maybe we can break it if it's frozen.
好耶！成功凍住了！=Yeah! It's frozen!
唔…… 兩個障礙物\n好像又是聯動在一起的啊。=Hmm... The two obstacles seem to be connected again.
先去調查那邊可拆卸的基座吧，WONDER.=Let's first check the detachable base, Wonder.
哦，凍住了。成功啦！=Oh, it's frozen. There!
哦，好重…… 這個……=This is... so heavy...
先嘗試使用青色費洛蒙射擊，\n打開旁邊的門吧，WONDER=Try the green phenomenon to open the door first, Wonder.
先嘗試使用綠色費洛蒙射擊，\n打開旁邊的門吧，WONDER=Try the green phenomenon to open the door first, Wonder.
似乎還需要一個藍色費洛蒙。\n找找附近牆壁上的水晶吧。=Seems like we need one pheromone. Let's search for the crystal.

路斷了啊……\n沒有橋的話，根本過不去。=The path's cut off... \nWithout a bridge, we can't cross.
是啊…… 不，等等。\n那邊有結晶哦。=Right... No, wait. There's a crystal over there!
攻擊它並注入費洛蒙能量的話，\n說不定會發生什麼？=Maybe try injecting it with phenomenons?
哇…… 好厲害！轉眼間全都凍上了。\n這樣就能過去了吧？=Whoa... it's all frozen in an instant! \nIs it safe to cross?
唔……凍得真厚實啊。\n這樣就不用擔心會碎了。前進吧！=Hoom... It's frozen solid. Let's move!
好滑啊…… 走路要多加注意……=It's so slippery... Watch your step...
有點像溜冰場呢。有點想玩一下呢！=Feels like a rink. Wanna skate?
是死路嗎…？不，應該哪裡有通路……\n 檢查一下周圍吧。=It's a dead end...? No, there should be a path... Check the surroundings.

那些工蟻…… 又在偷懶啊。=Those workers... slacking again...
喂，你們幾個。\n去找工蟻來收拾下這裡。=Hey, you. \nFetch some workers to clean this up.
其他傢伙應該就在附近的房間裡。\n坐膠囊電梯去找找吧。=They should be nearby. \nTake the capsule elevator.
必須趕在{{A}}到來前打掃乾淨才行……=Must clean this up before {{A}} arrives...
膠囊電梯是這個嗎？\n看起來沒有選樓層的按鈕……=Is this the capsule elevator? \nThere's no floor buttons...
姑且能站進去……\n不過有點太窄了吧？=We can barely enter... \nIsn't this too cramped?
是啊。怎麼說呢，\n感覺像是貨運電梯呢。=Yeah, it feels like a cargo lift.
雖然有很多在意的地方……\n但好像沒別的路了。=There seems to be no other way.
嗯…… 沒辦法。\n先坐上去看看吧，WONDER。=No choice... Let's try taking it, Wonder.
{{A}}…… 好擠啊 ——！={{A}}... So cramped—!
被擠得滿滿的貨物，\n大概就是這種感覺吧……=We're packed like cargo...
雖然說不上舒適……\n但借助這個可以輕鬆移動。=It's uncomfortable... but efficient. \nWe can use this to move around quickly.
好、好的！\n馬上收拾！=Y-Yes!\nRight away!
好厲害…… 全都凍住了。\n這樣就可以在上面行走了吧。=Amazing... It's all frozen. \nWe can now walk on it.
稍等，前方正在維修中。\n請稍後再來……=Wait, the area ahead is under maintenance.\nPlease come back later...
你們這些傢伙…… 是入侵者嗎！？=Are you... the intruders!?
前方是{{A}}的工作重地！\n未經許可，不准進入！={{A}}'s work area is ahead! \nNo entry!
{{A}}的工作重地……？\n說不定會有{{B}}的線索，去看看吧。={{A}}'s work area...? We might find clues about the {{B}}. Let's check it out.
竟然直呼女王大人的名諱…… 不可饒恕！\n就在這裡消滅你們！=You dare say Her Majesty's name... \nUnforgivable! I'll end you all!

Chapter 4 Part 2 Day 3 File Room
----------
這個房間裡似乎沒人呢。=The room appears empty.
這是什麼啊，放著好多文件……\n雜誌社的編輯部就是這樣嗎？=What are all these documents... \nIs this how magazine editorial offices look?
這些文件是什麼內容呢？\n說不定有攻略{{A}}的線索……=What are the contents of these files? Maybe they have hints for progressing through the {{A}}?
有道理啊。稍微調查一下吧。=Good point. Let's investigate briefly.
說起來，這些文件……\n書脊上都寫著男人的名字呢。=These files... \nall have men's names on the spines.
是啊……真的都是男人的名字。\n根本看不到像女生的。=Right... it's exclusively male names. \nNo girls at all.
啊，這個人的名字我認識！\n我記得他演過特攝片的主角！=Ah I recognize this name! \nHe starred in that tokusatsu series!
也有很多我認識的人……=Many familiar names here...
模特、偶像、演員……\n都是些年輕英俊的男性。=Models, idols, actors... \nall young attractive men.
有名字和個人資料……=A personal profile with a name...
甚至還有家庭背景、身世、興趣，\n和愛吃的食物……真是事無鉅細啊。=Even with family backgrounds, histories, hobbies, favorite foods... it's absurdly thorough.
甚至還有家庭背景、身世、興趣，\n和愛吃的食物……真是鉅細靡遺啊。=Even with family backgrounds, histories, hobbies, favorite foods... it's absurdly thorough.
我的天，竟然還寫著每天的日程！\n這什麼東西啊！=What, they've got daily schedules too! \nWhat is this!?
這已經屬於不能公開的隱私資料了吧。=This already falls under non-disclosable private information, right?
嗯，簡直是偵探或者跟蹤狂級別的了……=Yes, this is practically detective or stalker level surveillance...
這些文件裡難道都是這種內容？\n這簡直就是……=Are all these files like this? \nIt's basically a...
帥哥目錄？=Hot guy catalog?
被{{A}}陷害的人們？={{A}}'s victims?
Choice 1
噫……那是什麼……=Ew... What's that...
我覺得應該是，\n被{{A}}陷害過的人們的資料……=I think these are profiles of people {{A}} has framed...
但是男性也太多了吧。\n在我的印象中，被她陷害的女性也很多。=But there are too many men. \nShe's ruined plenty of women too.
也許隊長說得沒錯，\n還真是帥哥目錄。=Maybe the leader's right, \nit's really a catalog of handsome men.
Choice 2
的確……可能就是透過這些細緻的調查，\n來陷害對方的……=True... it's precisely this kind of thorough investigation that could be used to entrap them...
但是，{{A}}應該也陷害過很多，\n像我母親那樣的女性才對。=Yet {{A}} definitely framed many women like my mother too.
但這裡只寫著男藝人的名字。=But only the names of male celebrities are here.
那這些就是{{A}}喜歡的帥哥目錄……\n之類的吧？=So this is {{A}}'s hot guy catalog... \nor something?
媽呀我自己說這話都覺得噁心……=Ugh, even saying that makes me sick...
很有可能。\n畢竟之前，{{A}}守門人會特意讓帥哥通過。=Plausible. Remember how the {{A}} guards only let handsome men through?
唔，但只有一些吾等都不認識的男性名字，\n還不足以判斷對方的意圖……=Hoom, but with so many unfamiliar names, \nit's hard to discern her motives...
喂，看這個！=Hey, look!
這本寫著「{{A}}」。\n是那個秘書的名字吧！？=This one says "{{A}}" \nIsn't this that secretary's name!?
真的……快讓我看看！=Really... Let me see!
什麼啊，這個印章……\n寫的是「攻略完畢」嗎……？=What's this stamp... \nIt says "Conquered"?
哇，照片真好看～\n這是{{A}}？原來他還是個歌手啊！=Wow, great photo～ \nThis is {{A}}? He's even a singer!
嗯，我提到過吧？\n他做過一段時間偶像團體的隊長呢。=Yes, I mentioned this before, right? \nHe used to be a former idol group leader.
他跳舞很棒，唱歌主要是搖滾系。\n引領{{A}}的身姿也很帥氣……是我的榜樣。=He's an amazing dancer and mainly sings rock. The way he guides his {{A}} is so cool... He's my role model.
跳舞和搖滾……？這樣啊，我想起來了！\n我知道那個組合！=Dancing and rock...? Oh right, \nI remember! I know that group!
電視上還播過特輯！\n那個隊長原來就是{{A}}啊……！=They had a TV special! \nSo that leader was {{A}}...!
不過……大概是2年前吧。\n{{A}}突然退團了。=But... about two years ago, \n{{A}} suddenly quit.
似乎是說，\n「要換一家經紀公司，出去單飛」。=Apparently he said he was "transfering agencies to go solo".
其他成員還發過聲明，說……\n「之前不知道」「太突然了很吃驚」……=The other members seemed shocked, \nstatements said they "had no idea"...
粉絲也鬧得很凶，猜他們是不是鬧僵了，\n還有人說是{{A}}背叛了組合。=The fans were furious, speculating about internal conflicts... Some even accused {{A}} of betraying the group.
結果，{{A}}換了經紀公司後，\n就幾乎不再出現在公眾面前了……=After transferring agencies, \n{{A}} practically vanished from public view...
他離開後組合的人氣也一落千丈……\n聽說現在都上不了電視臺了，在做地下偶像。=The group's popularity plummeted... Now they can't even get TV gigs, performing underground.
雖然還在踏實地努力……\n但他們說照這樣下去，早晚也會解散的。=Though still working hard... \nmembers say disbandment seems inevitable.
這還真是……十分艱難啊……=What a tragic situation...
畢竟一旦出現了不好的風評，\n就很難逆轉了吧……=Once negative rumors spread, \nit's nearly impossible to turn it around...
那些支持他們的粉絲也很可憐啊……\n到頭來，誰都沒有得到幸福嘛……！=Those loyal fans suffered too... \nIn the end, nobody's happy...!
的確如此。\n為什麼當時{{A}}要換經紀公司呢……=Exactly. \nWhy would {{A}} transfer agencies...?
這是……=This is...
這啥啊，週刊雜誌的報導嗎？=What's this? \nA weekly magazine article?
這上面也蓋了章呢。\n「曝光暫緩」……？=It's stamped too... \n"Publication Hold"...?
IDL FACTORY，\n是{{A}}之前那個偶像組合的經紀公司。=IDL FACTORY, \nthis is {{A}}'s former agency.
不過……\n我可沒聽說那家社長有過暴力事件……=But... I never heard about their president being involved in assault...
我記得這個「洞口征人」，也是個歌手吧？\n好像還挺有名的……=This "Yukito Horaguchi", \nwasn't he a famous singer?
嗯，只不過業界裡的人都知道，\n他愛拈花惹草，名聲不太好。=Yes, though industry insiders know his womanizing reputation.
{{A}}，原來是這樣……！={{A}}, I see...!
其實剛才看到的文件中，\n也剛好有提到洞口的事情……=Actually, a file I saw earlier also mentioned Horaguchi...
大致翻了一下，\n感覺果然是傳聞中的那種人啊。=After skimming through, \nhe definitely matches the rumors.
那個人要是被別家的經紀公司社長施暴，\n肯定會在社會上大做文章的。=If that person got assaulted by a rival agency's president, it would've sparked a major scandal.
可是卻沒見過那樣的報導，\n甚至連一點傳言都沒有……=Yet there's no report, not even industry gossip...
是不是假新聞？=It's fake news?
{{A}}刻意隱瞞了？={{A}} hid it?
Choice 1
我覺得也是。既然連LUCE都不知道，\n那不就是{{A}}最拿手的假新聞嗎？=I agree. If even Luce doesn't know about it, then this must be {{A}}'s signature fake news, right?
這麼一想，就是因為太假了，\n所以沒人理她吧。=Come to think of it, it was probably too obviously fake, so nobody took her seriously.
是這樣嗎？\n從這個「曝光暫緩」的印章來看……=Really? Looking at this "Publication Hold" Hold' stamp... 
我反倒覺得有可能是真的……\n而「{{A}}延緩了這個報導」……=I think the opposite might be true... and "{{A}} deliberately delayed reporting it"...
把它用作威脅別人的黑料。=To use this as blackmail material.
Choice 2
……啊？什麼意思啊。=...Huh? What do you mean?
也就是說，這是真實發生過的事件，\n但「尚未被報導」……=Meaning this was a real incident that was \n"never made public"...
這個「曝光暫緩」的印章，\n就代表著{{A}}沒讓報導公開……=This "Publication Hold" stamp indicates {{A}} kept it unpublished...
好把它用作威脅別人的黑料。=To use this as blackmail material.
{{A}}、{{A}}、{{A}}？威脅……\n是說威脅這個社長嗎？={{A}}? Blackmail... You think she's blackmailing the agency president?
不，或許是……=No, or perhaps...
噫……！這是什麼，好噁心！=Ew...! What's this, it's disgusting!
遭到威脅的是{{A}}=<size\=23>{{A}} was the blackmail target</size>
遭到威脅的是社長=<size\=22>President was the blackmail target</size>
Choice 1
沒錯。她對經紀公司社長的不當行為保密，\n而交換條件就是……=Right. She concealed the president's misconduct in exchange for...
讓{{A}}對她言聽計從吧。={{A}}'s complete obedience.
Choice 2
不對，遭到威脅的是{{A}}哦。=No, {{A}} was the one getting blackmailed.
她對經紀公司社長的不當行為保密，\n交換條件是讓{{A}}對她言聽計從。=She concealed the president's misconduct in exchange for {{A}}'s complete obedience.
原來是這樣啊……！\n原來是這麼回事啊！=I see...! \nNow it all makes sense...!
{{A}}當年和我一起演出時，非常重情義，\n很擅長照顧別人，就像一位可靠的大哥。=When we performed together, {{A}} was fiercely loyal, a true older brother to us all.
他跟社長還有組合成員都相處得非常融洽。=He had great relationships with both management and his fellow group members.
所以像他那樣的人，突然背叛公司和同伴，\n退團什麼的……我一直都覺得很奇怪！=That's why his sudden betrayal, quitting the group, abandoning everyone... never made sense to me!
那個，莫非{{A}}換的經紀公司就是……=Wait, could {{A}}'s transfer be to...?
果然……\n上面寫著「轉入BEAUTIFUL HIGH」。=Of course... \n"Transferred to BEAUTIFUL HIGH".
{{B}}？那家公司……\n就是{{A}}讓LUCE加入的那個吧！？={{B}}? Isn't that... the same agency {{A}} tried forcing Luce to join!?
沒錯。恐怕{{A}}就是像這樣，\n陷害並脅迫中意的男藝人加入這家公司……=Right. I suspect {{A}} has been trapping and pressuring her favorite male celebrities into joining that company...
雖然不知道這是出於什麼目的，\n但肯定對她有什麼好處吧。=While her goal remains unclear, \nshe's definitely benefiting somehow.
難道說……\n這些資料上的人，全都是這樣？=You mean... \neveryone in these files fell victim to this scheme?
不，那樣的話人數就太多了。\n那家公司應該沒有這麼大的規模。=No, there are too many names here. \nThat company shouldn't be that big.
而且剛開始看的那些文件，\n並沒有蓋章呢。=Also, many earlier files weren't stamped at all.
應該還有些準備攻略的男藝人資料，\n也混在一起了吧。=Probably mixes confirmed victims with potential targets.
什麼鬼東西啊。也太噁心了吧……\n我都起雞皮疙瘩了。=What the heck. That's beyond disgusting... \nI'm getting goosebumps.
就這樣讓許多人成了犧牲品……=So many lives ruined...
所有人都被她剝奪了慾望=<size\=30>All had their desires stolen</size>
嗯！我們必須在下一個受害者出現之前，\n儘快讓她改心才行。=Right! We have to change her heart before more people suffer.
為了這個目標，\n我們快繼續前進吧。=For that goal, \nwe should press forward.
不，等一下。\n抱歉……我想先回一趟現實世界。=No, wait. \nSorry... I want to return to the real world first.
嗯？為什麼啊？=Hmm? Why?
我剛才提到過，\n這些資料裡有很多我認識的人。=As I mentioned earlier, \nI know many people in these files.
既然他們被{{A}}盯上了，\n那我想趁現在提醒一下他們。=If {{A}}'s targeting them, \nI should warn them immediately.
唔……但是，就算你跟他們說了，\n他們也不見得會相信你的話哦？=Hoom... but even if you tell them, \nthere's no guarantee they'll believe you.
唔……但是，就算你跟他們說了，\n他們也不見得會相信你的話哦！=Hoom... but even if you tell them, \nthere's no guarantee they'll believe you.
我明白。但既然我知道了這個陰謀，\n就不能再袖手旁觀了。=I understand. But now that I know about this conspiracy, I can't just stand by and do nothing.
如果對慾望被奪取置之不理……\n那才真的有辱怪盜之名吧？=Turning a blind eye to stolen desires... would betray everything the Phantom Thieves stand for.
嗯，LUCE說得對呀……！=Mhm, Luce is right...!
……確實。而且那些被奪走慾望的人，\n可能會做出什麼激烈的事，更不能不管了。=...True. And victims of stolen desires might act dangerously desperate too.
我也同意。雖然確實想儘快讓{{A}}悔改，\n但攻略這裡似乎還需要些時間。=I also agree. While we should prioritize {{A}}, Palace exploration will require more time anyway.
嗯，大家的意見已經匯總了。\n不過最終判斷權還是交給隊長你吧？=Hoom, we've heard everyone's input. \nThe final decision is yours, Leader.
先返回吧=Let's return now
想再探索一下……=<size\=29>I want to keep exploring...</size>
我知道了。就按你說的，\n吾等先返回現實世界吧。=Understood. \nWe'll return as you recommend.
抱歉啊，大家。\n我會儘快搞定的。=Sorry, everyone. \nI'll handle this quickly.
嗯，明白了。\n我當然會聽從隊長的指示。=Right, I understand. \nI'll follow your lead.
那就在合適的時候結束探索吧，\n不要辜負了LUCE的心意。=Let's conclude cleanly to honor Luce's convictions.
那，到時候就等處理完那些麻煩事，\n再繼續前進吧。=We'll resume our progress after handling this urgent matter.
等一下，讓LUCE辦完事情，再繼續前進吧。=We'll continue once Luce finishes the warnings.

Chapter 4 Part 2 Palace Part 1 End
----------
你沒事吧，{{A}}？=Are you okay, {{A}}?
在想{{A}}的事嗎？=Thinking about {{A}}?
嗯，抱歉。=Right, sorry.
我在想{{A}}，\n還有那些檔裡的人。=I was thinking about {{A}}, \nand the people in those files.
嗯，還有那個房間，那些檔裡的人……=Hmm, that room too, and the people in those files...
尤其是{{A}}……\n沒想到他被那樣威脅過啊。=Especially {{A}}... \nI had no idea he was threatened that way.
而且我之前，在不知情的情況下……\n還說了過分的話。=And back then, when I didn't know... \nI even said awful things to him.
{{A}}真是不可原諒。\n無論是媽媽的事，還是{{B}}的事……！={{A}} is unforgivable. For what happened to Mom, to {{B}}...!
嗯……！她還盯上了其他人吧，\n必須早點讓她改心才行！=Yeah...! She's targeting others too, right? \nWe have to change her heart quick!
那麼{{A}}，你去提醒你的熟人，\n大概要花多久？=So, {{A}}, how long will it take you to warn your acquaintances?
等我回去就立刻開始，\n到明天應該就能搞定。=I'll start right when I'm back, \nshould wrap up by tomorrow.
如果他們怎麼也不相信我說的……\n那就沒辦法了。我會果斷結束的。=If they won't believe me no matter what... fine. \nI'll end things cleanly.
吾知道了。但別說是在{{A}}得到的情報哦？\n他們肯定不會相信的。=I understand. Just don't mention you learned this from the {{A}}, they'd never trust it.
吾知道了。但別說是在{{A}}得到的情報哦！\n他們肯定不會相信的。=I understand. Just don't mention you learned this from the {{A}}, they'd never trust it.
嗯，我只不過是提醒一下他們。\n不會多說什麼的。=Yes, I'll just give them a heads-up. \nI won't say anything more than necessary.
{{A}}發來訊息了……={{A}} sent a message...
晚上好\nBEAUTIFUL HIGH\n我打聽到消息了=Good evening. \nI dug up some info on\nBEAUTIFUL HIGH.
方便的話\n明天能不能聊一下？=Free to talk tomorrow?
聊天訊息？誰發來的？=A text? From who?
{{A}}發的={{A}}
{{A}}好像查出什麼了=<size\=22>Seems like {{A}} found something</size>
BEAUTIFUL HIGH的事，\n她這麼快就幫我們查到了啊。=She already looked into BEAUTIFUL HIGH for us? That was quick.
她說明天想找你談嗎……\n那不是正好嘛。=She asked to speak with you tomorrow... \nHow convenient.
對啊。今晚等{{A}}那邊辦完事情，\n明天聽聽{{B}}是怎麼說的……=Right. After {{A}} handles his stuff tonight, \ntomorrow we'll see what {{B}} says...
都完事後，再繼續探索{{A}}，對吧！=Then, after everything's settled, \nwe'll continue exploring the {{A}}, right?
嗯，就這麼辦吧。\n舞臺排練就先請假吧，我來聯繫其他人。=Yes, that's the plan. I'll ask for time off from stage rehearsals, I'll contact the others.
那麼今天就先解散吧。\n大家都好好休息休息。=Let's call it a day for now. \nEveryone, take some time to rest.

----------
Chapter 4 Part 2 Day 5
----------
那麼，我來說一下調查結果。=Then, let me summarize the investigation.
經紀公司「BEAUTIFUL HIGH」，\n好像完全處於{{A}}的控制之下。=The talent agency "BEAUTIFUL HIGH" seems to be entirely under {{A}}'s control.
控制之下是什麼意思？=What do you mean by under control?
雖然沒有確鑿的證據，只是推測……=Well, there's no concrete evidence, \njust speculation...
「BEAUTIFUL HIGH」的社長，\n被{{A}}抓到了什麼把柄，無法反抗。=The president of "BEAUTIFUL HIGH" is under {{A}}'s control, she has leverage over him, leaving him powerless to resist.
也就是說，{{A}}才是公司的掌權者。\n她把中意的藝人轉進那家公司……=In other words, {{A}} is the real power behind the company. She transfers her favored celebrities into that agency...
然後隨心所欲地玩弄他們，\n聽說{{A}}內都是這麼傳的。=And then manipulates them as she pleases. \nThat's the rumor circulating within {{A}}.
那經紀公司的社長被抓住的把柄是？=What kind of leverage does the president have?
那我就不知道了。\n正因為大家還不知道，所以才算是把柄吧。=I have no idea. The fact that it's unknown is what makes it effective leverage, right?
的確是這個道理。=Fair point.
然後，我接下來要說的，\n就是{{A}}員工們親身經歷的「事實」了。=Now, what I'm about to say next is the "facts" experienced firsthand by {{A}} employees.
{{A}}把公司的藝人，\n像自己的私人秘書一樣帶在身邊。={{A}} treats the agency's celebrities like personal assistants.
就像{{A}}那樣？=Just like {{A}}?
是的。\n{{B}}似乎並不是{{A}}的員工。=Exactly. {{B}} isn't even a formal {{A}} employee.
聽說是把他當兼職人員，發了入館證，\n但只安排他打理自己貼身的事。=I heard he's treated as a part-timer with an access pass, but he's only assigned to handle her personal affairs.
這種做法，{{A}}那邊沒什麼怨言嗎……=Won't {{A}} complain about that...
聽說本來是不允許的……\n但這也恰恰證明，她在公司權力極大吧。=Normally, it'd be forbidden... \nwhich shows how much power she wields.
而且，聽說她還讓這個經紀公司的藝人們……=Moreover, I heard she makes the celebrities from that agency...
為自己開「私人演唱會」。=Hold "private concerts" for her.
這似乎也是事實，\n因為{{A}}內有人幫忙籌備過這些演唱會。=This seems to be true, as there are people in {{A}} who have helped organize these concerts.
反正……說不定演唱會只是對外的說法，\n實際上發生了更過分的事呢。=Who knows... maybe concerts is just a cover, and something much worse is actually happening.
聽說在演唱會辦完後，\n還有秘書臉上受了重傷。=I heard that after one of these concerts, \none of the secretaries had severe facial injuries.
臉上、受了重傷……！？=Facial... injuries!?
真的假的啊……那個混蛋，\n覺得沒人知道就這樣瞎搞嗎！=No way... that bastard, \nshe thinks she can get away with this!
這不是直接從目擊者口中得到的消息，\n所以不確定真假……但應該差不多。=This isn't firsthand information from an eyewitness, so I can't verify it... but it's likely true.
所以，我建議{{A}}不要換經紀公司。=So, I advise {{A}} not to transfer agencies.
嗯，不用你說，我肯定不會換的。=Yes, no need to tell me, I definitely won't.
不過，你能查到這些真是幫大忙了。\n我沒想到那家公司居然那麼過分……=Still, you've been a huge help digging this up.\nI had no idea that agency was so awful...
我也算沒白提醒他們。=I didn't warn them for nothing.
提醒？=Warn?
不，沒什麼。只是自言自語。=No, it's nothing. \nJust talking to myself.
簽約那個公司的明星們……\n是不是也像{{A}}那樣，被抓住了把柄呢？=The talents signed to that agency... are they also being held by leverage, like {{A}}?
應該不是所有人都這樣，\n但也不排除這個可能性吧。=Probably not all of them, \nbut it's possible, right?
而且，應該也有人是稀里糊塗的就進去了，\n現在正後悔吧。=And I'm sure some joined without realizing the truth and now regret it.
而且，應該也有人是糊里糊塗的就進去了，\n現在正後悔吧。=And I'm sure some joined without realizing the truth and now regret it.
被抓住把柄……強行舉辦私人演唱會，\n甚至還被暴力對待……=Havin' leverage held over them... forced to hold private concerts, even subjected to violence...
搞什麼啊這是！那些人應該……\n都夢想著成為藝人或者偶像吧！=What the hell is this!? Those people must... have dreamed of becomin' entertainers or idols!
尤其是那些被她當作秘書隨身帶著的明星，\n似乎成了她的發洩道具……=Especially the ones she keeps around as secretaries, they seem to have become her punching bags...
聽說即使在公司裡，她都會辱駡、踢打他們，\n嚴重的時候甚至打到對方骨折。=I heard she verbally abuses, kicks, and hits them even at the company, and in severe cases, even fractures bones.
太過分了……=That's terrible...
{{A}}，和之前的那個秘書也是，\n好像都受到了很惡劣的對待……={{A}} and that previous secretary too... \nthey seem to have been treated horribly...
然後，由於他們都被抓住了把柄……\n也不敢報警。=And since they all have leverage held over them... they can't even go to the police.
儘快讓她改心吧=Let's hurry
嗯，這不只是我個人的問題。\n{{A}}是個絕不能放過的人。=Yes, this isn't just about me anymore. That {{A}} is someone who shouldn't be left alone.
是的。她那種人要是在漫畫裡還能理解，\n但現實中居然也有，我也吃了一驚呢……=Right. It'd be one thing if she were a manga villain, but to think someone like her exists in real life, I'm shocked...
我也會為大家加油的，\n讓她儘早{{A}}吧……！=I'll cheer you all on too, \nplease change her heart as soon as possible...!
謝謝你告訴我們這些=Thanks for telling us
這個人情我一定會還的=I own you one
沒事，只要能讓{{A}}{{B}}……=No problem. \nAs long as {{A}}'s heart changes...
然後把大家大顯身手的故事告訴我，\n我就已經很滿足了。=And tell me how everyone did their best afterward, that's enough for me.
請加油啊，各位。=Do your best, everyone.
果然，我還是希望{{A}}是友軍啊。=I still hope {{A}} is on our side.
是啊，我覺得她是個好孩子。=Yes, I think she's a good kid.
不過，還有很多疑問沒有頭緒，\n所以也不能無條件相信她。=Still, there's too much we don't know, \nI can't bring myself to fully trust her.
現在先集中精神攻略{{A}}=<size\=26>For now, let's focus on the {{A}}</size>
等解決完{{A}}之後再考慮吧=<size\=29>We'll deal with that after {{A}}</size>
嗯。這兩天我已經和認識的人都聯繫過了，\n這邊也沒問題了。=Right. I've already contacted everyone I know over the past two days, I think I'm set now.
抱歉讓大家久等了。\n我們走吧，隊長！=Sorry for keeping you all waiting.\nLet's go, Leader!

----------
Chapter 4 Part 2 Palace Part 2 Start
----------
好高的天井……\n看來前面還有很長的路要走。=What a high patio... looks like there is still a long way to go.
根據地圖顯示，從這裡似乎進入了新的區域。=According to the map, we're entering a new area.
別鬆懈啊，WONDER。=Keep your guard up, Wonder.
等等，請出示「資格證」。=Wait, please show the "qualification certificate".
「資格證」？="Qualification certificate"?
沒錯。前方是重要區域，\n沒有「資格證」就不准入內。=That's right. Ahead is an important area, you cannot enter without a "qualification certificate".
而且，開始作業前必須徹底淨身，\n你們連這個都不知道嗎？=Also, you must clean yourself thoroughly before work. You don't even know this?
淨身？什麼意思？=Clean yourself thoroughly? What do you mean?
雖然不太清楚…… 但總之必須先\n拿到「資格證」。探索一下附近吧。=I'm not sure... but let's look for the "qualification certificate" nearby.
看！\n這是不是就是那傢伙說的「資格證」？=Look!\nIsn't this the "qualification certificate"?
居然就普通地放在桌子上……\n管理也太鬆散了吧。=It was just placed on a table... \nthe management is too lax.
拿走吧=Take it
 收下了！=Steal it away!
收下了！=Steal it away!
找到了前往顏料間的「資格證」……=Found the "qualification certificate"...
去給剛才的螞蟻陰影看看「資格證」吧。=Let's show that ant Shadow the "qualification certificate".
確認完畢。進去先淨身，\n然後去顏料間工作吧。=Confirmed. Go get yourself clean, \nthen go to the Paint Room to work.

{{A}}！\n這什麼味道…… 消毒液嗎？={{A}}! \nWhat's that smell... disinfectant?
果然就像剛才那個螞蟻陰影說的，\n大家好像都在清潔身體……=Just like the Shadow earlier said, everyone seemed to be cleaning their bodies...
那些到處都是的標語是怎麼回事？\n這也是{{A}}的認知嗎？=What are the slogans for? \nIs this also {{A}}'s cognition?
應該是吧。現實中的{{A}}，\n恐怕也覺得部下員工們很髒吧。=Probably. The {{A}} in the real world probably thinks their employees are very dirty.
幸好螞蟻陰影們似乎並沒注意到我們。\n繼續前進吧。=Fortunately, the ant Shadows didn't seem to notice us. Let's keep going.
前進吧，WONDER。=Let's go, Wonder.

這房間是怎麼回事……\n地面上的方形洞裡好像有液體……？=What's with this room...? \nThere's some liquid on the floor...
可能是剛才螞蟻陰影說過的顏料間吧。=This must be the Paint Room that ant Shadow mentioned earlier.
喂，站住！\n你們是新來的？=Hey, stop!\nAre you new?
這裡的顏料很脆弱，\n凍住就不能使用了。=The paint here is delicate, \nif it freezes, it becomes unusable.
那樣的話就無法印刷雜誌，\n會觸怒{{A}}。=If that happens, we can't print the magazines, and that'll anger {{A}}.
漫長訓話之後，就是全員加班……\n連「那個人」的演唱會都準備不了。=We'll get lectured for hours and have to work overtime... Won't even have time to prep for that person's concert.
不想變成那樣的話，就別發呆！\n趕快去監督那些工蟻們！=If you don't want that, quit slacking off! \nGo supervise the worker ants already!
居然真的要辦演唱會……\n但「那個人」是誰呢？=So they're actually holding a concert... \nBut who is "that person"...?
難道說…… 不，應該不會吧……=Don't tell me... No, it can't be...
這片區域深處應該就是演唱會區域了。\n去那裡就能知道答案。=The Concert Area should be deeper in this area. We'll find our answer there.
那台切紙刀…… 似乎被凍住了。=This paper cutter... seems to be frozen.

喂，那邊的你們！=Hey, you over there!
在說我們嗎？=Are you talking about us?
沒錯。需要儘快把最新樣稿送上去，\n快去取來！=That's right. I need to send the latest draft as soon as possible, go get it!
我們去取？=We're getting it?
 你自己去不行嗎？=<size\=27>Can't you go by yourself?</size>
你自己去不行嗎？=<size\=27>Can't you go by yourself?</size>
遺憾的是我現在走不開。\n正忙著監督工蟻們呢。=Unfortunately, I can't leave. I'm busy supervising the worker ants.
那些傢伙一不留神就會偷懶，\n還想在大人面前獻殷勤。=Those guys will be lazy if I'm not careful.
照照鏡子就該知道自己有多沒用吧……=Look in the mirror and they'll will see how useless they are...
總之，趕緊把樣稿取來！=Anyway, get the draft quickly!
擺什麼架子…… 為什麼偏要我們去做啊？=Why are you putting on airs... \nWhy do we have to do it?
你剛才說什麼？=What did you just say?
沒什麼。什麼都沒說。=Nothin'. Nothin' at all.
似乎不拿到樣稿就無法繼續前進了。\n找找看吧。=It seems that we can't continue without getting the draft. Let's look for it.

有結晶呢。不過在玻璃箱裡……\n怎麼辦？=There's the crystals. But it's in a glass box... What to do?
或許可以像之前的玻璃機關一樣，\n用藍色費洛蒙能量試試？=Maybe we can try using blue pheromones energy like the glass mechanism before?
這台切紙刀好像還在運作……\n凍住讓它停下來吧，WONDER。=This paper cutter seems to be working... Let's freeze it, Wonder.
樣稿應該就在這個房間裡吧…… ？=The draft should be in this room...?
嗯？你們是什麼人？\n這裡禁止入內。=Huh? Who are you people? \nThis area is off-limits.
啊…… 那個，我們是來取樣稿的……=Ah... Well, we're here to pick up the draft...
什麼？樣稿必須直接親手交給{{A}}。\n怎麼可能給你們。=What? Drafts must be delivered directly to {{A}} in person. No way we're handing it over to you.
哈…… 看來你們想搶走樣稿，\n在大人面前邀功！沒門！=Ha...! So you're trying to steal the draft and take credit in front of Shimotsuna-sama! Not happening!
直接動手了嗎…… 沒辦法！\n應戰吧，WONDER！=They're attacking outright... \nNo choice! Let's fight, Wonder!
真是的……\n一個個都是些無法溝通的傢伙啊。=Seriously... Every single one of them is impossible to reason with.
是啊…… 不過正常情況下，\n{{A}}手下也容不下正常人吧。=Right... Though to be fair, {{A}} probably wouldn't keep normal people around anyway.
趁還沒惹出更多麻煩前，\n趕緊拿上樣稿走吧。=Let's get the draft and get out of here before we attract more trouble.
怎麼這麼久！\n快點送上去吧！=What's taking so long! \nHurry up and deliver it already!

從這裡開始是新區域嗎……\n演唱會區域好像還在更前面。=Is this the start of a new area... The Concert Area seems to be further ahead.
嗯。這裡應該是地圖上標注的\n印刷工廠附近。=Yes. This should be near the Printing Factory marked on the map.
哦～……終於到了嗎～……\n樣稿帶來了吧？=Oh～... You're finally here～... \nYou brought the draft, right?
用這個樣稿，\n製作宣傳用的雜誌試印本吧。=Use this draft to make a trial print of the promotional magazine.
哈？又要跑腿？\n差不多該你自己動手了吧。=Hah? More errands? Shouldn't you handle this yourself by now?
為{{A}}效力是你的榮幸……\n前面就是「印刷室」。快去吧。=Serving {{A}} is an honor... The Printing Room is just ahead. Get moving.
啊…… 不過要先找工蟻，\n搬開那些礙事的紙箱才行啊。=Ah... But first, find some worker ants to move those obstructive cardboard boxes.
還要再接受清洗和消毒……=And go through cleaning and disinfection...
結果還是要我們來做……\n真麻煩啊……=So it's still up to us... \nWhat a pain...
和之前經過的房間很像。\n不過感覺警戒度提高了不少呢。=This looks similar to that previous room, but security feels tighter now.
多加小心，維持螞蟻形態，\n順利通過這裡吧。=Stay cautious, let's keep the ant disguise and get through here.

這裡恐怕就是印刷室了吧……=This must be the Printing Room...
啊，你們是新來的吧？=Ah, you're new here, right?
這裡是「切紙間」。\n需要準備後續印刷用的紙張。=This is the paper-cutting section. We prepare paper sheets for the printing process.
具體來說，就是用那邊的控制台\n操作切紙機，把紙卷切成合適的紙張。=Basically, use the control panel over there to operate the paper cutter and slice rolls into usable sheets.
總之，操作起來就明白了。\n先去面板那裡看看吧。=You'll get the hang of it once you start. \nGo check the control panel first.
到底要讓我們幹多少事情啊……=How much more work are they gonna dump on us...?
抱怨也沒用。\n先去面板那裡看看吧，WONDER。=Complaining won't help. \nLet's just check the panel, Wonder.
成功了，WONDER！=Success, Wonder!
線路規劃完畢了，幹的好=Completed route planning, well done.

接下來又要做什麼？\n感覺有好多奇怪的機器……=What now? There are so many strange machines here...
喂！不要乾站在那裡，\n趕緊來幫忙！=Hey! Quit standing around, \nget over here and help!
準備好印刷用的彩色油墨，\n不然印表機就無法開始印刷！=Prep the colored ink for printing, \nor the printers won't start!
感覺已經習慣被指使了……=...I'm getting used to taking orders at this point.
雖然吾也不情願……\n但為了前進只能照做了。=Unpleasant as it is... \nwe'll have to play along to proceed.
看來這次也要用面板操作。\n試試看吧，WONDER。=Looks like we're using the control panel again. Give it a try, Wonder.
不愧是隊長，輕鬆解決了。=As expected from the leader, you solved it easily.

你們是新來的嗎？這裡是「裝訂間」。\n是製作試印本的最後工序了哦。=Your first time here? This is the Binding Room, the final step in producing the trial print.
使用裝訂機，按照模版要求，\n將各種顏色的紙按順序裝訂起來。=Use the binding machine to assemble the colored papers in the correct sequence based on the template.
使用控制台去操作吧，\n按需求裝訂出成品就可以了。=Just operate it via the control panel, bind them as specified, and you're done.
那個，試印本完成後，\n我們就可以送到上層去了嗎？=So... once the trial print's finished, \ncan we deliver it upstairs?
難道說…… 想直接交給{{A}}？=Don't tell me... you want to hand it to {{A}} personally?
對對。絕對會好好交給她的！=Yes! We'll absolutely deliver it to her!
可以的哦。但在此之前，\n必須先完美完成成品才行哦。=Fine. But first, you'd better make sure it's flawless.
太好了～！謝謝！=Great～! Thank you!
這樣看來能去更上層了。\n趕緊完成試印本吧。=Looks like we're getting closer to the upper levels. Let's wrap up this trial print, quickly.
弄完這一次，試印本就完成了。=After this, the trial print is completed.

Bravo！完成了！=Bravo! It's done!
嗯嗯，不錯。\n真努力啊。=Hmm, not bad. You've worked hard.
…… 現在，你們已經沒用了。\n趕快出去。=...Now, you're useless. \nGet out.
哎？=Huh?
沒聽見嗎？\n叫你們從這裡出去。=You deaf? \nI said get out.
你們不會真的以為，\n幫忙印刷就能見到{{A}}吧？=Don't tell me you actually thought helping with printing would get you an audience with {{A}}?
再說了，沒有演唱會門票，\n根本無法前進。=Besides, without concert tickets, \nyou're not going anywhere.
演唱會門票？\n那是什麼？=Concert tickets?\nWhat's that?
連演唱會需要門票都不知道……？\n你們果然是入侵者！？=You didn't even know tickets were required...? You're definitely intruders!?
不准靠近{{A}}！\n就在這裡解決你們！=You won't reach {{A}}!\nI'll end you right here!
切……！上吧，WONDER！=Tch...! Let's go, Wonder!

本以為那個螞蟻陰影很和藹，\n沒想到居然在騙我們……=That ant Shadow seemed so friendly at first... \nI can't believe it was deceiving us all along.
為了向{{A}}爭寵，可以不擇手段……\n真是可笑。=They'll stoop to anything to win {{A}}'s favor... How pathetic.
根據剛才的對話，\n前進需要演唱會門票……=From what we just heard, \nwe'll need concert tickets to proceed...
嗯…… 但剛才打倒的陰影，\n身上好像並沒有門票。=Hmm... But the Shadow we just defeated didn't seem to have any tickets on it.
先問問這附近的陰影怎麼樣？=Should we ask the Shadows around here?
也只能這樣了。\n拜託了，WONDER。=No other choice.\nPlease, Wonder.

{{A}} 我的門票……={{A}} My ticket...
那個…… 打擾一下？\n想問問演唱會門票……=Um... excuse me? \nAbout those concert tickets...
煩死了！\n別跟我提門票！=Shut up! \nDon't even mention tickets to me!
我的票被路過的兵蟻搶走了！=Mine got stolen by a soldier ant!
說什麼工蟻根本沒資格去演唱會……=Said worker ants like me don't deserve to attend...
好不容易可能有機會見到{{A}}！=After I finally had a chance to see {{A}}...!
{{A}}…… 那真是遺憾。\n話說，那隻兵蟻在哪裡？={{A}}... That's rough. Where'd that soldier ant go?
那傢伙去了別的地方。\n把門票留在那個房間了……=Took off somewhere else. \nLeft the ticket in that room over there...
哈？居然把門票留下了。\n那你直接拿回來不就行了？=Hah? It just left it there? \nWhy not grab it back yourself?
不行…… 我沒那個勇氣……\n被發現的話肯定會被欺負……=I... I can't. They'll bully me if I'm caught...
唔……雖然可憐，但對我們來說正好。\n去拿下那張門票吧。=Tch... Pathetic, but convenient for us. \nLet's go claim that ticket.
感覺這個房間……似乎有點可疑。\n去調查一下吧，WONDER！=This room... feels suspicious. Go and investigate, Wonder!
好，拿到門票了。\n馬上試試能不能用吧，WONDER。=Right, we got the tickets. Let's try using it now, Wonder.
前方區域需要門票才能進入。\n你們有票嗎？=The area ahead requires a ticket to enter.\nDo you have it?
…… 好的，沒問題。請進去吧。=...No problem. \nPlease enter.
進入新區域了呢。=We've entered a new area.
唔…… 前方有相當強大陰影的氣息。\n全體警戒。=Hmm... I'm sensing an extremely powerful Shadow ahead. Stay sharp, everyone.

Chapter 4 Part 2 Shadow Daichi Boss
----------
這是什麼地方……\n和之前的氛圍不一樣啊……=Where is this place... \nThe vibe is different from before...
這是……某種監獄嗎？=Is this... some kind of prison?
怎麼了，WONDER？=What's wrong, Wonder?
{{A}}……！？\n你為什麼會在這裡……={{A}}...!? Why are you here...
{{A}}的認知存在={{A}}'s Cognitive Being
還以為是誰呢……這不是{{A}}嗎。=Thought it was someone else... \nIt's just you, {{A}}.
再往上走就是{{B}}的私人領域。\n就算是{{A}}你，沒有許可也不能通行。=Further up is {{B}}'s private area. Even you, {{A}}, can't pass without permission.
私人領域？\n意思是{{A}}的房間嗎？=Private area? \nYou mean {{A}}'s room?
雖然還不確定……\n但那多半就是她藏{{A}}的地方了吧！=Not sure yet... But that's probably where she's hiding the {{A}}!
讓我們過去=Let us through
我們找{{A}}有事=<size\=21>We have business with {{A}}</size>
那可不行。\n我負責這裡的警備。=No can do. \nI'm in charge of security here.
我現在是她的第一秘書。能擔此重任……\n{{A}}，真是無上的榮幸。=I'm her top secretary now. To be entrusted with this... {{A}}, what an honor.
為什麼你那麼開心……！=Why are you so happy...!
你問為什麼……因為伺候{{A}}，\n才是我存在的唯一理由。=Why...? Because serving {{A}} is the only reason for my existence...
冷靜點，LUCE。\n這傢伙不是{{A}}本人。=Calm down, Luce. \nThis isn't the real {{A}}.
這只是{{C}}的認知存在……\n是{{A}}心裡的「{{B}}」。=This is just {{C}}'s cognitive being... \n{{A}}'s version of "{{B}}".
……啊，這樣啊。\n原來是這樣啊……=...Ah, I see. \nSo that's how it is...
雖然從冒牌貨嘴裡可能問不出什麼……\n不過，{{B}}。你被{{A}}抓到了把柄吧？=Might not get much out of a fake, but... {{B}}, {{A}} has some leverage on you, right?
把柄？什麼意思？=Leverage? What do you mean?
我是說，\nIDL FACTORY社長的施暴事件。=I'm talking about the IDL FACTORY president's assault incident.
你是為了保護社長，\n才轉到{{A}}的經紀公司……對吧？=You transfered to {{A}}'s agency to protect the president... correct?
啊……你說那件事啊。=Ah... you're talking about that.
{{A}}的確對我說過，\n「正在猶豫要不要刊登社長的暴行」。={{A}} did say to me, "I'm debating whether to publish the president's violence".
畢竟我們社長，把那位知名偶像洞口，\n給狠狠地揍了一頓呢。=After all, our president beat up that famous idol, Horaguchi.
為什麼會發生那種事……=Why did that happen...
洞口……對我們公司要推的新人偶像，\n灌了安眠藥，然後動手動腳。=Horaguchi... he drugged a rookie idol from our company and assaulted her.
那個女孩剛出道沒多久，還懷揣著夢想，\n是個從鄉下來到大城市的、純粹的孩子。=That girl was new, full of dreams, a pure kid who came to the city from the countryside.
洞口居然還笑著來公司道歉，\n所以社長才狠狠揍了他一頓。=Horaguchi even came to the company laughing and apologizing, so the president punched him hard.
怎麼這樣……！使用暴力當然不對，\n但這不全都是那個洞口的錯嘛！=What the heck...! Violence's wrong, \nbut isn't this all Horaguchi's fault!
反倒是為什麼那位女性偶像被侵犯的事情，\n沒有被曝光呢……？=How come the assault on that female idol was never exposed...?
……被壓下去了啊。洞口的公司實力雄厚。\n就算他再怎麼爛，也還是當家偶像啊。=...It was covered up. Horaguchi's company has power. No matter how awful he is, he's still their top idol.
為了掩蓋自己的醜聞，\n他們當然會竭盡全力來毀掉別人。=To hide his scandal, \nthey'd go all out to crush others.
{{A}}……聽了就讓人生氣……！={{A}}... this pisses me off...!
所以洞口的經紀公司，\n才會跟在娛樂圈無人能敵的{{A}}聯手。=So Horaguchi's agency teamed up with {{A}}, the invincible queen of entertainment.
然後讓洞口作了偽證。\n實際上我也聽過那段錄音。=Then they had Horaguchi give false testimony. \nI've actually heard the recording.
錄音？=Recording?
他哭訴說，IDL FACTORY的社長，\n一個勁地打他，真的非常可怕……=He cried about how the IDL FACTORY president kept hitting him, how terrifying it was...
真是個彌天大謊。但{{A}}，\n卻不計前嫌地……向我伸出了援手。=A complete lie. But {{A}}, \ndespite everything... reached out to me.
她說這消息傳出去，社長在業內就呆不了了，\n經紀公司會倒閉，偶像組合也會解散……=She said if this got out, the president would be blacklisted, the agency would go under, and the idol group would disband...
如果想避免這種結果，就去她的經紀公司。\n只要照做，她就不會公開這份報導。=If I wanted to avoid that, I had to join her agency. If I did, she wouldn't publish the story.
原來如此。這傢伙……\n為了保護經紀公司、社長，以及組合……=I see. So this guy... To protect the agency, the president, and the group...
什麼伸出援手啊！\n那些都只是{{A}}在威脅你吧！=What reaching out! \nThat's just {{A}} threatenin' you!
這位{{B}}是{{A}}產生的認知存在。\n所以眼前的這個他，只會說她的好話……=This {{B}} is a cognitive being from {{A}}. So this version of him only says good things about her...
我失去了一切……\n同伴和粉絲如今都把我當成叛徒。=I lost everything... My teammates and fans all see me as a traitor now.
但是，只有{{A}}不一樣。\n只有{{A}}向我伸出了援助之手！=But, {{A}} is different. \nOnly {{A}} reached out to me!
她愛著被其他人嫌棄的我……\n給了我一個容身之處啊！=She loved me when everyone else despised me... \nShe gave me a place to belong!
你只不過是被利用了！=You're just being used!
嗯，WONDER說得對！\n{{A}}的目的從一開始就是這樣……！=Yes, Wonder's right! \n{{A}} planned this from the start...!
{{A}}，你懂的吧？娛樂圈是個殘酷的世界。\n想獨自生存下去是很難的……=You get it, right, {{A}}? \nThe industry is cruel. Surviving alone is hard...
但只要待在{{A}}身邊，就高枕無憂了。\n{{A}}會一直保護我們的。=But with {{A}}, you're safe. \n{{A}} will always protect us.
雖然有時候她會動粗，但打是親罵是愛。\n倒不如說，那是一種獎勵……！=Sometimes she gets violent, but that's just tough love. If anything, it's a reward...!
雖然有時候她會動粗，但打是情罵是愛。\n倒不如說，那是一種獎勵……！=Sometimes she gets violent, but that's just tough love. If anything, it's a reward...!
這就是……{{A}}心中的{{B}}……？\n那傢伙的精神狀態也太扭曲了吧……！=This is... {{A}}'s version of {{B}}? \nHer mental state is so distorted...!
好啦，你也過來這邊吧，{{A}}。\n別逞強了，只要聽{{B}}的話就好。=Come on, join us, {{A}} \nStop resisting, just obey {{B}}.
開什麼玩笑！\n這種話怎麼能從你口中說出來！=Are you kidding me!\nI can't believe you'd say that!
我絕對不會原諒{{A}}……！\n我也會拯救現實世界中的你！=I'll never forgive {{A}}...! \nI'll save the real you too!
你這話我就不愛聽了……\n你該不會是想反抗{{A}}？=I don't like that tone... \nAre you planning to defy {{A}}?
嗯。我要打倒{{A}}，\n奪走{{B}}，讓那傢伙改心！=Yes. I'll beat {{A}}, \nsteal the Treasure, and change their heart!
她的暴行，我會……\n不對，我們{{A}}一定會阻止！=Her tyranny, I'll...  \nNo, we, the {{A}} will stop it!
這樣啊……那就沒辦法了。=I see... Then it can't be helped.
雖然我不想跟你戰鬥，\n但你要傷害{{A}}，就另當別論了……=I didn't want to fight you, but if you're going to hurt {{A}}...
保安！！=Security!!
警衛！！=Guard!!
{{B}}……\n嘎{{A}}！！={{B}}...\n{{A}}!!
這是什麼……{{A}}的樣子怎麼……！=What's this... \nWhy does {{A}} look like...!
{{B}}，這也是{{A}}認知的影響嗎……！={{B}}, {{A}}'s cognition again...!
「第一秘書就算賭上性命也會保護自己」，\n這種扭曲的思想，賦予了那傢伙強大的力量！="Her top secretary will protect her at all costs", that twisted idea gave him power!
可惡，{{A}}那混蛋……！\n看來只能上了……！？=Damn it, {{A}}...! \nGuess we've got no choice...!?
{{A}}……我要在這裡把你打倒，\n讓你發誓效忠{{B}}……！={{A}}... I'll take you down, and make you swear loyalty to {{B}}...!
不會讓你得逞的=Not happening
全部奪回來吧，LUCE！=Let's take it all back, Luce!
謝啦，隊長……！=Thanks, Leader...!
Segui il tuo cuore（聽從內心）！\n大家，助我一臂之力吧！=Segui il tuo cuore (Follow your heart)! \nEveryone, lend me your strength!

{{A}}，不要反抗……={{A}}, stop resisting...
你也要成為{{A}}的狗！=You too must become {{A}}'s dog!
你還打算反抗嗎……？=You still plan to resist...?
明明順從{{A}}，\n才是絕對的正確……為什麼？=When obeying {{A}} is the only right path... Why?
是我錯了嗎……？\n不，不可能……！=Was I wrong...? \nN-No, impossible...!
敵人的戰意正在下降……？\n再堅持一下，或許能等到攻擊的機會！=The enemy's will is wavering...? \nHold on a little longer, we might get an opening!
為什麼會變成這樣……=Why did it come to this...
沒辦法……我是叛徒，\n哪裡都沒有我的容身之所……=There's no other way... I'm a traitor, \nwith nowhere left to belong...
除了成為{{A}}的狗，\n我別無生路……=Becoming {{A}}'s dog is my only path to survival...
{{A}}……求您寬恕我……\n拯救悲哀的我吧……={{A}}... please forgive me... \nSave this wretched soul...
那是{{A}}創造出來的認知存在吧？\n可是，為什麼看起來這麼痛苦呢？=That's a cognitive being {{A}} created, right? But why does it look so tormented?
{{A}}也理解{{B}}的痛苦。\n她是在享受讓他逐漸屈服的過程……={{A}} understands {{B}}'s suffering too. She enjoys the process of breaking him down...
{{A}}……這人到底是有多惡毒！={{A}}... just how cruel can one person be?!
{{B}}……{{A}}！\n{{A}}賜予了我慈悲！={{B}}... {{A}}!\n{{A}} has shown me mercy!
只要成為{{A}}的狗，就什麼都不用擔心了！{{A}}會永遠庇護我！=Once you become {{A}}'s dog, all your worries vanish! {{A}} will protect me forever!
來吧……你們也一起讚美{{A}}！\n向{{A}}宣誓效忠吧！=Come... join me in praising {{A}}! Swear your loyalty to {{A}}!
敵人的戰意回復了……！？\n大家，當心他的攻擊！=The enemy's will has recovered...!? \nEveryone, brace for his attack!
{{A}}……現在只能一邊忍耐，\n一邊等他再次洩氣嗎！真是麻煩！={{A}}... Now we have to endure until his spirit breaks again? What a pain!
到此為止了嗎……\n{{A}}，原諒我……=Is this the end... \n{{A}}, forgive me...
{{A}}……你一定會後悔的……={{A}}... you'll regret this...
你本可以，成為{{A}}的寵兒的……=You could've been {{A}}'s favorite...

唔……{{A}}……=Ugh... {{A}}...
{{B}}……不管你說什麼，\n我都不會選擇成為{{A}}的男寵。={{B}}... No matter what you say, I won't choose to become {{A}}'s plaything.
但是，如果反抗的話……\n也許就沒辦法繼續當演員了啊……？=But if you resist... \nWon't you lose your acting career...?
即便如此，我也不會。=Even so, I refuse.
為什麼……為什麼要做到那種地步……=Why... Why go that far...
明明只要接受了{{A}}的愛，\n就能活得輕鬆自在……=If you just accepted {{A}}'s love, \nlife would be so much easier...
難道不是因為，那並不是愛嗎？=Isn't it because that isn't love at all?
沒錯。那只是用單方面的威脅來操縱人心，\n是種醜陋不堪的感情。=Exactly. It's just one-sided coercion, \na twisted, ugly emotion.
接受那種東西，是無法獲得安寧的。\n其實你心裡也明白吧？=Accepting that won't bring peace. \nDeep down, you know that too, right?
{{B}}……我接下來說的話不是針對你，\n而是針對「造出你的{{A}}」。={{B}}... What I say next isn't directed at you, but at {{A}}, who created you.
{{A}}。你以為你能隨心所欲地控制別人。\n這種{{B}}至極的慾望……={{A}}. You think you can control people as you please. This prideful desire...
我們{{A}}一定會奪走的！=We, the {{A}}, will steal it away!
……即使你後悔，\n也不關我的事了……=...Even if you regret this, \nit's no longer my concern.
……我是不會後悔的。\n絕對不會。=...I won't regret it. \nNever.

這扇門好像上著鎖。\n既沒有鑰匙孔，也不知道該如何解鎖……=This door seems locked. There's no keyhole, \nI have no clue how to open it...
既然是{{A}}的私人區域，\n可能需要一些特殊的條件才能解鎖。=Since it's {{A}}'s private area, \nmaybe there's a special condition to unlock it.
話說，我們才剛結束一場激烈的戰鬥。\n就先調查到這裡，回到現實比較好吧。=That said, we just finished a fierce battle. \nLet's call it here and return to the real world.
同意……何況對LUCE來說，\n身心都已經非常疲勞了吧……=Agreed... Besides, Luce must be exhausted, \nboth physically and mentally...
再往前就是{{A}}的私人領域了，\n也就是說，前面的警戒只會更加森嚴。=Beyond this is {{A}}'s private area. \nSecurity will only get tighter from here.
我認為等體力和裝備都調整到最佳狀態，\n再繼續攻略會比較好。=Let's get our strength and gear ready first, \nbetter to advance at full power.
的確是這樣=Indeed
雖然很遺憾，但是返回吧=<size\=27>It's a shame, but let's head back</size>
……是啊。雖然心裡很著急，\n但是貿然前進導致意外的話，就得不償失了。=...Right. As frustrating as it is, \ncharging ahead recklessly would be worse.
了解，我就聽從隊長的決定了。=Understood. I'll follow the leader's call.
嗯，那吾等返回現實世界吧。=Hm, then let us return to the real world.

小心！前面的水面帶電，不要踩進去。=Watch out! The water ahead is electrified, don't step in.

你們好啊，我負責看守這裡的顏料。=Hello, I'm in charge for guarding the materials here.
你們和我一樣喜歡顏料嗎？=Do you like the colors just like me?
其實喜不喜歡都無所謂啦，\n我這裡有一些顏色相關的謎題。=It doesn't matter whether you like it or not, I have some color-related puzzles here.
看見這些方格裡的彩色顏料了嗎？\n它們沒有排列成我想要的樣子……=See the colored paint in these squares? They're not arranged the way I want them to be...
你們能用藍色費洛蒙，\n把它們變成我喜歡的樣子嗎？=Can you use blue pheromones to make them what I like?
我最不喜歡的就是<color\=#ff0000>綠色</color>，\n可以幫我把<color\=#ff0000>綠色</color>的都清除掉嗎？=I don't like <color\=#ff0000>green</color>, can help me clear all <color\=#ff0000>green</color>?
WONDER，這個工蟻不喜歡<color\=#ff0000>綠色</color>。=Wonder, this worker doesn't like <color\=#ff0000>green</color>.
獲取藍色費洛蒙，<color\=#ff0000>冰凍</color>顏料吧。=Let's obtain blue pheromones and <color\=#ff0000>freeze</color> the paint.

你們好啊，有興趣來玩數字謎題嗎？=Hello, are you interested in playing a number puzzle?
比起顏色，我果然還是更喜歡數字呢。=Compared to colors, I like numbers more.
你看，這些顏料的數量都太沒有規律了。=You see, the quantities of these paints are too irregular.
這些顏料不知道是誰運送到這裡的，\n太混亂了。=I don't know who delivered these paints here, it's too chaotic.
我希望每種顏料的<color\=#ff0000>數量</color>一致。\n你們能幫幫我嗎？=I hope the <color\=#ff0000>quantity</color> of each paint to be the same. Can you help me?
WONDER，觀察每種顏料的<color\=#ff0000>數量</color>。=Wonder, observe the <color\=#ff0000>quantity</color> of each paint carefully.
讓每種顏料的數量<color\=#ff0000>一致</color>。=Make sure the quantity of each paint is <color\=#ff0000>the same</color>.

幹得好啊各位，你們也很喜歡這個遊戲對吧？=Great job, everyone! You're enjoying this game too, right?
我還有更多的獎勵，\n你們願意再聽一聽我的訴求嗎？=I have more rewards, would you like to hear my next request?
顏料還是這些顏料，但我又改主意了。=The paints are still the same, but I've changed my mind again.
我覺得還是不規律的數量更好一些。=I think irregular quantities work better after all.
我希望每種顏料的<color\=#ff0000>數量</color>不一致。\n你有辦法嗎？=I hope the <color\=#ff0000>quantity</color> of each paint to be different. Can you manage that?
讓每種顏料的數量<color\=#ff0000>不一致</color>。=Make sure the quantity of each paint is <color\=#ff0000>different</color>.

你們是什麼人？正好，我這裡缺人手。=Who are you? Perfect timing, I'm short on help here.
我不喜歡任何不對稱的東西。\n這些顏料雖然已經很完美了，但還是差了點。=I can't stand anything asymmetrical. These paints are nearly perfect, but something's still off.
你們的手槍似乎可以射出藍色費洛蒙？\n那可真巧。=Your guns seem to fire blue pheromones? What a coincidence.
我希望全部<color\=#ff0000>圖案對稱</color>。=I hope all <color\=#ff0000>pattern are symmetrical</color>.
嘗試讓<color\=#ff0000>圖案對稱</color>吧。=Let's make the <color\=#ff0000>patterns symmetrical</color>.

這些工蟻竟然敢不尊敬{{A}}，\n你們快來幫我教訓一下他們。=These worker ants dare to disrespect {{A}}? Help me teach them a lesson!
工蟻們竟然敢不瞻仰{{A}}的畫像，\n美麗的{{A}}在他們眼裡是醜陋的嗎？=How dare these workers fail to admire {{A}}'s portrait? Do they find the beautiful {{A}} ugly in their eyes?
這是何等的不尊敬，\n我無法原諒這種行為。=Such disrespect! \nI can never forgive this behavior.
給它們幾拳就老實了！\n它們會像陀螺一樣原地轉圈！=A few good punches will straighten them out! They'll spin around like tops!
教訓這<color\=#ff0000>四隻</color>工蟻，\n直到它們都願意瞻仰{{A}}的美貌。=Punish these <color\=#ff0000>four</color> worker ants until they all properly admire {{A}}'s beauty.
變身成為兵蟻，教訓這<color\=#ff0000>四隻</color>工蟻，\n讓它們都<color\=#ff0000>面朝{{A}}的畫像</color>。=Transform into a soldier ant and teach those <color\=#ff0000>four</color> a lesson, they must all <color\=#ff0000>look at {{A}}'s portrait</color>.
幹得漂亮，你幫我好好地教訓了它們。\n這些傢伙再也不敢對{{A}}不敬了。=Good work. They no longer dare to disrespect {{A}}.
這個寶箱就送給你吧。=I'll give this treasure chest to you.
狂躁的隊長蟻領著工蟻們離開了。=The manic captain ant left with the worker ants.

沒有幹勁的時候，\n就想想自己怎麼拼命從貧民窟爬上來的。=When you're not feeling it, just remember how you clawed your way out of the slums.

Chapter 4 Part 2 End

你沒事吧，LUCE。=Are you okay, Luce?
嗯。雖說那是冒牌貨，但是以本人的模樣，\n對我說那些話……還是刺激到我了呢。=Hm. Even though it was a fake, seeing his face say those things... got to me.
為了保護公司和同伴，被冠以叛徒之名，\n還被{{A}}隨意蹂躪……=To protect his company and friends, he took the blame, even let {{A}} trample all over him...
而且，恐怕社長和公司那邊，\n至今都不知道{{A}}辭職的理由吧？=And the president and the others... They probably still don't know why {{A}} quit, do they?
應該是吧……那個認知存在雖然沒說，\n但他肯定是想犧牲自己，換來大家的幸福。=Probably... That cognitive version didn't say, but he must've sacrificed himself for their sake.
畢竟從我當初遇到他以來，\n他都十分珍視經紀公司的社長和{{A}}……=Even back when I first met him, he always cared deeply for the president and his {{A}}...
真是條漢子啊。而且他在{{A}}的折磨下，\n都忍了2年了，也太厲害了……=What a man. And to endure {{A}}'s abuse for two years, that's amazin'...
正因為他是這樣的人，我才想拯救他。\n好人得不到好報……這世界太不合理了！=That's exactly why I want to save him. \nGood people shouldn't suffer like this... it's wrong!
揭露{{A}}的罪行吧=<size\=30>We'll expose their crimes</size>
嗯！只要讓{{A}}改心，\n{{B}}應該也能重頭再來。=Yes! If we change {{A}}'s heart, \n{{B}} can start over too.
偶像被迫放棄了夢想，一定很痛苦吧……！\n我們把那些夢想也都一起奪回來吧！=An idol forced to abandon his dreams, that's cruel...! Let's steal those dreams back for him!
為此必須保持最佳身體狀態才行。\n今天大家早點回家，好好休息一下吧。=But first, we need to be in top shape. \nEveryone, let's hurry home and rest up today.
來，上車。回入口處吧！=Come on, hop in. Back to the entrance!
謝謝！好像CATTLE一變成車，\n就有種「總算能回去了～」的感覺呢。=Thank you! When Cattle turns into a car, \nit feels like "I can finally go home～".
一坐上車就要睡著了……呼啊……=I'm gonna pass out as soon as I sit down... Yawn...
笨蛋，還不能放鬆警惕。\n在返回現實世界之前，都還是探索途中！=Fools, don't let your guard down! It's exploration until we return to the real world!
遵～命～{{A}}！=Yes～ {{A}}!
不是，你當我們在郊遊嗎……=No, do you think we're on a school trip...
我有個問題！\n瑪格麗特披薩算零食嗎！？=Question! \nIs Margherita pizza a snack?
你別也跟著裝傻啊！\n還有，披薩肯定不是零食吧！=Don't you start too! \nAnd no, pizza's not a snack!
好像有人在看著我們……=I feel like someone's watching us...
一個人也沒有……\n是錯覺嗎……=No one's here... \nWas it my imagination...
喂～快上車啦隊長！\n不然把你留在這裡了哦！=Hey～ hurry up, Leader! \nOr we're leavin' you behind!

還有，副部長說她對背景音樂也有些建議。=Also, the Vice President said she has some suggestions for the background music.

最近幾天，\n{{A}}戲劇社一直在幫忙……=Lately, the {{A}} drama club has been helping out...
多虧了他們，\n現在能像正式演出一樣排練了……=Thanks to them, we can rehearse as if it's the real performance now...
{{A}}，我們排練得越來越好了～\n最開始我還擔心搞不定呢！={{A}}, our rehearsals are getting better and better～ I was really worried we couldn't do it at first!
還好選{{A}}當了{{B}}=<size\=25>Good thing {{A}}'s the {{B}}</size>
{{A}}也太適合演媽媽了={{A}}'s perfect for the role
{{A}}的才華得到發揮了=<size\=28>{{A}}'s talent is really shining</size>
Choice 1
{{A}}，真的嗎……！\n你誇得好直白啊，有點害羞……={{A}}, really...! That's such a direct compliment, I'm a bit embarrassed...
r:"^(.*)，謝謝！\n(.*)演哥哥也超帥的！$"="$1, thanks! $2's super cool as the older brother too!"
而且啊，說來也奇怪，\n最近我都習慣了{{A}}演的媽媽了～=You know, it's kind of strange, but I've gotten used to {{A}} playing the mom～
Choice 2
我懂……！\n{{A}}真的越來越像媽媽了，這怎麼得了……=I know...! {{A}} is really becoming more and more like a mom, it's crazy...
感覺哪天我會不小心，\n直接叫他「媽媽」呢……=I feel like I might accidentally call him "Mom" someday...
Choice 3
我懂……！明明是個打手，\n但黑之戰鬥員的存在感真的很強！=I know...! Even though he's a lackey, the Combatant in Black has such a strong presence!
那個姿勢是他即興發揮的呢。\n真有想像力啊……=That pose was improvised by him. \nSo imaginative...
而且，我也慢慢習慣{{A}}演的媽媽了。=I'm also getting used to {{A}} playing the mom.
哎喲哎喲，{{A}}，作業做完了嗎～？=Oh dear, oh dear, {{A}}-chan, have you finished your homework～?
撲哧！=Pfft!
吃飯前得先把作業做完哦～\n今晚是味噌拉麵～=You need to finish your homework before dinner～ It's miso ramen tonight～
等、等一下，{{A}}……=W-Wait, {{A}}...
加點餃子吧媽媽=Mom, add some gyoza
媽媽，每天都吃拉麵啊……=Mom, it's ramen every day...
Choice 1
真拿你這孩子沒辦法。\n餃子每人三個喲！=Oh, you silly child. \nThree gyoza each, then!
Choice 2
說什麼呢，拉麵可是營養餐啊。=What are you talking about, ramen is nutritious.
r:"^(.*)，(.*)你怎麼也……！\n真的太搞笑了！$"="$1, $2 too...! \nThat's hilarious!"
{{A}}你怎麼了……沒事吧？={{A}}, what's wrong... \nAre you okay?
啊，{{A}}……沒事的。\n只是笑得喘不過氣了……=Ah, {{A}}... It's fine. I'm just laughing so hard my our sides hurt...
背景音樂那邊，沒什麼問題吧？=Is everything okay with the background music?
嗯，不愧是{{A}}戲劇部啊，\n每個細節都考慮得那麼周到……=Yes, as expected from the {{A}} drama club, they're so thorough with every detail...
真是幫了大忙，我也學到了不少東西。=They've been a huge help, \nand I've learned a lot too.
雖然是{{A}}一意孤行搞的活動，\n但現在想想真的幸好沒放棄。=Even though this was an event that {{A}} pushed through on his own, looking back now, I'm really glad we didn't give up.
我也這麼想=I think so too

Choice 1
{{A}}，是嗎？\n真期待學園祭呢。={{A}}, really? I'm really looking forward to the school festival.

是啊……如果沒有這次活動，\n我們可能根本見不到{{A}}呢。=Yes... If it weren't for this event, we probably never would have met {{A}}.

而且{{A}}的媽媽，\n根本不是這種人設啦～=Besides, the mom of {{A}} isn't supposed to be like this～
看來你完全掌握這個角色了啊……{{A}}。=It seems you've completely mastered the role... {{A}}.
嗯，我會成為最棒的媽媽的……！=Yeah, I will become the best mom...!
怎麼{{A}}也這樣……\n哎呀真討厭～=Even {{A}} is like this now... Make it stop～
真的笑死了～\n好了，說回{{A}}的事吧，{{A}}的事！=I'm dying～ Okay, back to the {{A}} topic, {{A}}!
抱歉抱歉，稍微開個玩笑。=Sorry, sorry, I'm just jokin'.
說正經的，今天一定要去到上面那層。=Seriously though, we have to reach the upper level today.
之前{{B}}的「認知存在」說過，\n說過那是{{A}}的「私人領域」對吧。=That cognitive {{B}} said it was {{A}}'s "private area," right?
私人領域啊。\n聽起來就是藏{{A}}的地方。=Private area... That sounds like a place where the {{A}} would be hidden.
不過，越接近{{A}}，\n陰影就會變得越強哦。=However, the closer we get to the {{A}}, \nthe stronger the Shadows will become.
雖然能理解大家急切的心情，\n但從現在起我們得加倍小心地前進才行。=I understand everyone is eager, but from now on, we need to proceed with extra caution.
嗯？{{A}}好像有點低落啊。=Hmm? {{A}} seems a bit down.
有什麼困擾嗎？=<size\=27>Is something bothering you?</size>
是害怕了嗎？=Are you scared?
啊，沒事……\n只是聽到{{A}}的名字，有點……=Ah, it's nothing... It's just that when I heard {{A}}'s name, I felt a bit...
啊，抱歉，不是的。\n只是聽到{{A}}的名字，有點……=Ah, sorry, no. It's just that when I heard {{A}}'s name, I felt a bit...
{{A}}啊……={{A}}...
不過，前幾天吾等在{{A}}裡打敗的，\n只是認知上的存在而已。別太往心裡去。=However, what we defeated in the {{A}} the other day was just a cognitive being. Don't take it to heart.
嗯，我當然明白。=Yes, I understand that, of course.
要從現在的狀況中拯救{{B}}的話，\n只有讓{{A}}改心才行。=To save {{B}} from this situation, the only way is to change {{A}}'s heart.
我只是在想……\n{{A}}之後會怎樣呢？=I was just thinking... what will happen to {{A}} afterwards?
事到如今，\n他也不可能回到以前的事務所了吧。=At this point, he probably can't return to his old agency, right?
是啊……如果{{A}}改心了，\n「BEAUTIFUL HIGH」就沒了。=Yeah... If {{A}} has a change of heart, "BEAUTIFUL HIGH" will be gone.
那樣的話，{{A}}就沒有地方去了。=In that case, {{A}} won't have a place to go.
不過，現狀已經夠糟了，\n沒工作可能反而對他更好吧。=But, the current situation is bad enough, maybe havin' no job would actually be better for him.
當然，如果能回到原來的組合繼續活動，\n那是最好不過的了。=Of course, if he could return to his original group and resume activities, that would be the best outcome.
{{A}}當初是為了保護事務所和其他成員，\n才離開的嘛……={{A}} left originally to protect the agency and the other members, after all...
如果能解開誤會，\n是不是就能再好好相處了呢？=If they can clear up the misunderstanding, \nmaybe they can get along again?
不好說啊……考慮到{{A}}的性格……=That's hard to say... \nconsidering {{A}}'s personality...
即使擺脫了{{A}}的控制，\n可能也不會主動說出真相吧。=Even if freed from {{A}}'s control, he might not take the initiative to tell the truth.
被剝奪了慾望的人之後會怎麼樣，\n吾等也無能為力。=What happens to those whose desires have been stripped away afterwards is beyond our control.
即使我們可以幫忙，但想要恢復慾望，\n最終還是得靠那個人自己。=Even if we can offer help, restoring desire ultimately depends on that person themselves.
抱歉，耽誤大家時間了。\n總之得先讓{{A}}改心才行。=Sorry for holding everyone up. In any case, we must first change {{A}}'s heart.
我們去{{A}}吧。=Let's go to the {{A}}, everyone.

「發現{{A}}和女高中生漫畫家{{B}}，\n在校內進行不正當的異性交往！」="Discovered improper relationship between {{A}} and high school manga artist {{B}} at school!"
嗯，就這種程度嗎。\n作為醜聞的話有點弱……=Well, is that all? \nAs a scandal, it's a bit weak...
把這張照片裡的其他學生打上馬賽克，\n弄成看起來只有兩個人的樣子，明白嗎？=Blurred the other students in this photo to make it look like it's just the two of them, understand?
是、是……不過，主編……\n{{A}}是別家公司的人氣漫畫家吧？=Y-Yes... But, editor-in-chief... {{A}} is a popular manga artist from another company, right?
這樣做不太好吧……\n萬一被告說是假的怎麼辦……=This doesn't seem appropriate... What if we get accused of publishing fake news...
哈？你說我拿到的料是假的？=Hah? Are you saying the story I got is fake?
哈？你說我拿到的爆料是假的？=Hah? Are you saying the story I got is fake?
不，絕對不是！因為獨家消息來得太突然，\n嚇了我一跳所以才……{{A}}……=No, absolutely not! It's just that this exclusive came so suddenly, it shocked me... {{A}}...
本來就是因為你們沒拿到有用的黑料，\n所以才得靠我出手吧。=The reason I had to step in is precisely because you all failed to dig up any useful dirt, right?
話說{{A}}他媽媽的醜聞怎麼樣了？\n你去義大利出差的成果呢？=Speaking of which, what about the scandal on {{A}}'s mom? Any results from your trip to Italy?
那個……\nStella完全不和異性單獨相處……=Ummm... Stella absolutely avoids being alone with the opposite sex...
顯然是因為以前的事，\n她現在對醜聞非常警惕……=It's obvious she's extremely wary of scandals because of what happened before...
{{A}}～那就拿這5個人聚餐的照片，\n來做一篇熱戀曝光的報導吧。={{A}}～ Then take this photo of the five of them dinner together and turn it into an exposed romance article.
剛剛說的那些，\n都要確保能登上下一期哦。=Make sure everything I just mentioned is ready for the next issue.
是、是……=Y-Yes...
那個……主編。\n我負責的那個{{A}}的文章……=Ummm... editor-in-chief. About that article I'm responsible for, the one on {{A}}...
「{{A}}50問」，和4張彩頁……=The "{{A}} 50 Questions," \nwith 4 color pages...
哦，給我看看。=Oh, let me see it.
啊，對不起！我還沒完成……\n我只是想確認一下是不是可以繼續進行。=Ah, sorry! I haven't finished it yet... I just wanted to confirm if it's okay to continue working on it.
如果下期要發布他的醜聞，\n那應援文章是不是就不能用了……=If we're publishing a scandal about him in the next issue, then maybe this support article can't be used...
如果下期要發佈他的醜聞，\n那應援文章是不是就不能用了……=If we're publishing a scandal about him in the next issue, then maybe this support article can't be used...
啊，沒關係，繼續做吧。\n下一期是什麼方向還沒定呢。=Ah, it's fine, keep working on it. The direction for the next issue isn't finalized yet.
發表哪篇文章，就看他怎麼表現了……\n{{A}}……=Which article gets published depends on how he behaves... {{A}}...
啊，那是什麼意思……？=Ah, what does that mean...?
我有必要和你這個新人解釋嗎？\n還是……你對我的編輯方針有什麼意見？=Do I need to explain myself to a rookie like you? Or... do you have some objection to my editorial policies?
啊，不，我不是這個意思！\n那我就繼續進行！=Ah, no, that's not what I meant! I'll continue working on it then!
{{A}}……\n一想到文章可能會作廢，就提不起勁啊……={{A}}... Thinking the article might get scrapped just kills my motivation...
{{A}}，新來的。\n光這樣就沒勁了，在公司可混不下去哦。=Hey, rookie. If you lose steam over something like this, you won't last long in this company.
是嗎……？\n話說這到底是怎麼回事？=Really...? But what's actually going on?
居然給{{A}}，\n準備了應援和打壓的兩篇文章……=Preparing two articles for {{A}}, one to support him and one to tear him down...
誰知道呢……不過，\n{{A}}的無理要求也不是一天兩天了。=Who knows... But {{A}}'s unreasonable demands are nothing new.
確實確實～=True, true～
說到底，\n我也搞不懂為什麼主編這麼執著於{{A}}。=When you think about it, I don't really get why the editor-in-chief is so fixated on {{A}}.
確實他在某些地方挺受歡迎的，\n但在公眾眼裡還只能算個無名小卒……=Sure, he's popular in certain circles, but to the general public he's still pretty much a nobody...
啊，肯定是因為那件事吧。\n我也只是聽說，知道的不多。=Ah, it must be because of that incident. But I only heard a little, I don't know the details.
{{A}}以前……={{A}}, in the past...
喂，你倆小點聲。\n如果被主編聽到了，可不止丟工作那麼簡單。=Hey, you two, keep it down. If the editor-in-chief hears you, losing your job will be the least of your worries.
別跟新人說那些沒用的。\n還有，你也別問東問西了。=Don't fill the rookie's head with useless gossip. And you, stop asking so many questions.
對{{A}}主編，不問、不惹、不反抗。=With editor-in-chief {{A}}, don't ask, don't provoke, don't resist.
如果想在這個行業混下去，這就是鐵律。=If you want to survive in this industry, \nthat's the rule.

好了，今天終於可以去下一層了。=Alright, today we can finally head to the next floor.
首先，去一下前幾天……\n遇到{{A}}認知存在的那個區域吧。=First, let's go to the area where we encountered {{A}}'s cognitive being the other day.
那邊深處的門，\n應該通往{{A}}的私人領域。=The door at the far end there should lead to {{A}}'s private area.
……但那扇門關著，而且沒有鎖眼吧？\n我們怎麼開？=...But that door is shut, and there's no keyhole, right? How do we open it?
……但那扇門關著，而且沒有鎖孔吧？\n我們怎麼開？=...But that door is shut, and there's no keyhole, right? How do we open it?
之前還沒好好探索過。\n先在周圍找找解鎖的線索吧。=We haven't explored that area thoroughly yet. Let's search the surroundings for clues to unlock it first.

啊！大家等一下。\n我感覺到前面有強大陰影的氣息。=Ah! Everyone, wait. I sense the presence of a powerful Shadow ahead.
{{A}}……終於回來了呢。\n她有段時間沒回私人領域了。={{A}}... has finally returned. She hasn't been back to her private area for a while.
是啊。最近她一直泡在辦公區，\n修理她的魔法棒呢。=Yes. Lately, she's been holed up in the office area, repairing her magic wand.
嗯，也只能這樣了吧。\n上層那些傢伙估計是修不好這個的。=Hmm, I suppose that's the only way. \nThe guys upstairs probably can't fix this.
上層……是指那些「派對咖」嗎。\n這倒也是呢。=Upstairs... You mean those "party animals"? That makes sense.
「派對咖」？那是什麼……="Party animals"? What's that...?
快看！\n那扇門打開了吧？=Look! \nThat door opened, didn't it?
它們說過，{{A}}回到了上層…… \n也許那就是開啟的條件。=They said {{A}} returned upstairs... Perhaps that's the condition for it to open.
那就好辦了。\n快把它們打倒，去私人領域吧！=That's convenient. Let's defeat them quickly and head to the private area!
走吧，大家！=Let's go, everyone!
今晚是派對之夜！=It's party night!

你們這些傢伙！是入侵者嗎！=You! Are you intruders!?

好了，搞定了！=Alright, done!
那我們去上層吧。\n別掉以輕心哦，不需要我再贅述了吧。=Let's head upstairs. Don't let your guard down, need I say more?
男公關風格的陰影=Host Shadow

男公關風格的陰影們=Host Shadows
可愛、超可愛！最棒、最強、最漂亮！\n我們的！公主大人！{{A}}！=Cute, super cute! The best, the strongest, the most beautiful! Our! Princess! {{A}}!
怎、怎麼回事……？\n好吵啊，氣氛有點奇怪……=Wh-What's going on...? It's so loud, the vibe's weird...
感覺像是什麼活動或是演唱會……？=It feels like some event or concert...?
感覺像是什麼活動或者演唱會……？=It feels like some event or concert...?
與其說是某個活動，感覺更像是牛郎店……=Rather than an event, \nit feels more like a host club...
牛郎店！？=A host club!?
牛郎店就是這個樣子的嗎……？=Is this what a host club is like...?
不知道。我又沒去過。=I don't know. I've never been to one.
派對咖陰影=Party Animal Shadow
{{A}}！歡迎光臨！\n各位怎麼稱呼～？={{A}}! Welcome! \nWhat should I call you all～?

啊！難道是……？\n想進店的男公關～還是新來的公主～？=Ah! Could it be...? Are you aspiring hosts～ Or new princesses～?
男公關！？是說我們嗎！=Hosts!? You mean us!?
公主？{{A}}……=Princess? {{A}}...
別當真，CLOSER……=Don't take it seriously, Closer...
不過很遺憾！\n我們這裡不接受其他公主哦！=But unfortunately! \nWe don't accept other princesses here!
我們的公主是……{{A}}心動無上限！\n最棒、最可愛、唯一的女王！=Our princess is... {{A}} with her limitless charm! The best, the cutest, the one and only queen!
快來快來，你們也一起喊起來！=Come on, come on, you all chant along too!

……才怪啊我不會被帶跑的！=...No way I'd say that!
什麼！？居然不喊{{A}}的口號！？\n你們……！=What!? You won't chant for {{A}}!? You...!
為什麼不喊？為什麼不喊！\n因為是入侵者，所以喊不出？=Why won't you chant? Why won't you chant!? Is it because you're intruders?!
那就、去死去死去死去死去死去死！\n去死去死、去死吧！goodbye！=Then, die die die die die die! Die die, die! Goodbye!

還從來沒有遇到過，\n一邊喊口號一邊打過來的敵人……=I've never encountered enemies who chant slogans while attackin'...
那就是所謂的「派對咖」吧……\n{{A}}，真是恐怖如斯……=So those are the so-called "party animals"... \n{{A}}, how terrifying...
嗯……也就是說，{{A}}是這裡唯一的公主，\n被人愛戴著，捧在手心裡吧。=Hmm... That is to say, {{A}} is the only princess here, loved and pampered by everyone.
她對這個想法居然沒有一點懷疑……\n果然是個自我認同感很高的人。=The fact that she doesn't doubt this idea at all... She must really has a strong sense of self-importance.
不是，別那麼認真地推理啦……\n那傢伙不就是滿腦子想的這些嗎？=No, don't analyze it so seriously... Isn't that exactly what those creeps would be thinkin'?
{{A}}的氣息越來越近了。\n應該就在樓上吧。=The {{A}}'s presence is getting closer. \nIt should be upstairs.
好，那我們就探索一下這層，\n找找通往上面的路線。=Alright, let's explore this floor and find a route to the upper floors.
這地方，光是走路就感覺耗盡了力氣……=Just walking around this place feels exhausting...
為了改心=<size\=27>It's for the change of heart</size>
要不要喊個口號=<size\=28>Should we chant a slogan?</size>
我知道的。\n只是有點累而已。=I know. I'm just a bit tired.
別這樣……我會更洩氣的。=Don't say that... It's making me feel even more drained.
嗯，至少我明白了，\n{{A}}打從心底就是個無可救藥的人。=Well, at least I know now that {{A}} is utterly hopeless deep down.
走吧，去奪走那個傢伙的{{A}}。=Let's go, let's steal their {{A}}.

歡迎來到<color\=#ff0000>「CLUB AGETEKO」</color>。=Welcome to <color\=#ff0000>"CLUB AGETEKO"</color>.
{{A}}？什、什麼啊突然……={{A}}? Wh-What's this, so sudden...
……好像沒有敵意，\n不必過於警戒了。=...They don't seem hostile. \nNo need to be overly cautious.
<color\=#ff0000>「CLUB AGETEKO」</color>……\n這是{{A}}裡的牛郎俱樂部名字嗎？=<color\=#ff0000>"CLUB AGETEKO"</color>... Is that the name of the {{A}}'s host club?
或許吧……如果真是這樣，\n那肯定和{{A}}的認知有關……=Probably... If so, it's definitely related to {{A}}'s cognition...
<color\=#ff0000>「CLUB AGETEKO」</color>……\n最好記住這個名字。=<color\=#ff0000>"CLUB AGETEKO"</color>... Let's remember this name.

瞧啊，這顆結晶……顏色混雜在一起了呢。=Look, this crystal... its colors are mixed.
兩種顏色我都見過……\n也許是同時吸收了兩種能量？=I've seen both colors before... \nMaybe it absorbed both types of energy?
原來如此……那說不定可以同時補充\n兩種費洛蒙能量了。=I see... Perhaps it can replenish both types of pheromone energy at once.
青色與橙色費洛蒙能量恢復了。=Recovered green and orange pheromones energy.
綠色與橙色費洛蒙能量恢復了。=Recovered green and orange pheromones energy.
唔…！　旁邊的柵欄升起來了。=Hoom...! The fence is up.

{{A}}？難道是死路？={{A}}? A dead end?
我記得路上沒有岔路啊……\n這是怎麼回事？=I don't remember any forks in the road... \nWhat's going on?
仔細觀察一下，\n看看有沒有前進的路……=Let's observe carefully and look for a way forward...
我還以為只是個擺設呢，\n這東西居然能打開啊！=I thought it was just a decoration, but this thing can actually open!
秘密通道……大概是這種地方吧。\n啊，我覺得也沒到秘密到那種程度……=A secret passage... I guess it's that kind of place. Well, not that secret, I suppose...
這條通道，總覺得毛骨悚然……=This passage feels kinda creepy...
是啊。不過，這不正像是\n怪盜潛入路線的感覺嗎？=Yes. But doesn't it feel like a proper infiltration route for a Phantom Thief?
終於出來了……\n走吧，繼續前進。=We're finally out... Let's keep going.

這扇門好像上鎖了。\n中央還有奇怪的圖案……=This door seems locked. There's a strange pattern in the center too...

現在不是能開門的時間，還是放棄吧。\n我想等牛郎們來了門就能開。=It's not the right time slot for the door to open, just give up. I think it'll open when the hosts arrive.

而且到了那個時間段，\n現場氣氛會變得特別像派對！=And when that time slot comes, the atmosphere gets really party-like!
而且到了那個時間，\n現場氣氛會變得特別像派對！=And when that time slot comes, the atmosphere gets really party-like!
牛郎……就是我們在這片區域遇到的\n那些吵鬧的陰影吧？=Hosts... must be those noisy Shadows we encountered in this area?
又是他們啊……\n老實說只有不好的預感……=Them again... \nHonestly, I have a bad feelin' about this...

在{{A}}到來之前，\n讓我們先把氣氛炒熱起來吧=Before {{A}} arrives, \nlet's heat up the atmosphere!
好啊！我也要成為像<color\=#ff0000>「天崎聖彌」</color>一樣的\n{{A}}的寵兒！=Yeah! I want to become Princess Takami's favorite, just like <color\=#ff0000>Seiya Amasaki</color>!
剛說完就來了啊……=Speak of the devil...
氣氛變化真大啊……\n而且，看那個。=The atmosphere changed so much... \nAnd look at that.
和聽說的一樣……=Just like we heard...
看來那扇門必須等到這個時間段才能開。\n不過，相應地……=It seems that door only opens during this time slot. But, accordingly...
看來那扇門必須等到這個時間才能開。\n不過，相應地……=It seems that door only opens during this time slot. But, accordingly...
剛剛這個時間段開著的門，這次就會關上……\n是這意思吧。=The door that was open during the last time slot will be closed now... Is that it?
剛剛這個時間開著的門，這次就會關上……\n是這意思吧。=The door that was open during the last time slot will be closed now... Is that it?
嗯……總之\n現在只能從開著的門先走了。=Hoom... For now, we can only go through the doors that are open now.

派對的時間到了！\n{{A}}會來嗎！？=It's party time! Will {{A}} come!?
門又關上了……\n什麼時候才能見到{{A}}啊……=The door closed again... When will I get to see {{A}}...

{{A}}，什麼！？\n為什麼突然就變身了！？={{A}}, what!? \nWhy did we transform!?
這房間裡也有{{A}}的肖像畫啊……\n不過，好像和之前的不太一樣。=This room has a portrait of {{A}} too... \nBut it seems different from before.
真的耶，\n好像比之前更噁心了……=Yeah, it's even more gross than before...
看起來像是{{A}}的本性顯露出來了。\n不過，這個造型是……=It looks like Shimotsuna's true nature is showing. But, this form...
看起來很弱……=It looks weak...
沒有裝備……=There's no equipment...
嗯……怎麼說呢，像是人偶一樣……？=Hmm... how to put it, it's like a doll...?
嗯？剛剛好像有人聲……=Hmm? I thought I heard a voice...
那是……{{A}}的人偶！？\n怎麼會出現在這裡？=That's... {{A}}'s doll!? \nWhy is it here?
算了，沒關係。總之得抓住它，\n把{{A}}的人偶送回她的房間！=Whatever, it's fine. I have to catch {{A}}'s doll and return it to her room!
被它跑掉了啊……\n算了，回去準備派對吧……=It got away... Forget it, let's go back and prepare for the party...
真危險啊。\n沒想到會突然襲擊我們……=That was close. \nI didn't expect to be suddenly attacked...
他們說是{{A}}的人偶……\n看來果然和CLOSER的判斷一樣。=They called it {{A}}'s doll... \nIt seems Closer's judgment was right.
{{A}}的人偶？\n開什麼玩笑！={{A}}'s doll? Are you kiddin' me!
這種狀態下沒辦法正常戰鬥。\n找到恢復的方法之前都得小心行動。=We can't fight properly in this state. We'll need to proceed with caution until we find a way to revert.
前面有陰影。\n得小心別被發現了。=There are Shadows ahead. We need to be careful not to be spotted.

這邊好像被柵欄擋住了，過不去。=This way seems blocked by a fence, \nwe can't get through.
旁邊好像有個裝置……\n也許能用來控制柵欄。=There's a device nearby... \nMaybe we can use it to control the fence.
不過，這個像球的零件壞了。\n看來需要更換。=But, this ball-like part is broken. \nSeems like it needs replacement.
說不定有替代的零件=<size\=26>Maybe there's a replacement</size>
去找找替代品吧=<size\=29>Let's look for a substitute</size>
我們肯定修不好，\n看來只能這樣了。=We definitely can't fix this ourselves.\nLooks like that's the case.
以往經驗來看，附近某個地方應該有。\n找找看吧，Wonder。=Based on past experience, there should be one somewhere nearby. Let's look for it, Wonder.
以往經驗來看，附近某個地方應該有。\n找找看吧，WONDER。=Based on past experience, there should be one somewhere nearby. Let's look for it, Wonder.

這個好像能用……=This seems usable...
呼……終於解放了。\n謝謝你們，陌生人……=Phew... I'm finally free. \nThank you, strangers...
剛剛那是什麼啊……？=What was that just now...?
像是魔法書……？\n總覺得以前看過類似的動畫……=Like a magic book...? I feel like I've seen this in an anime before...
看起來不是陰影……\n應該是認知存在吧？=It doesn't look like a Shadow... \nProbably a cognitive bein'?
大概吧……？=Probably...?
不知道是什麼的認知……=What cognition is that...?
想也想不明白……現在\n還是優先修好那個裝置吧。=No use thinking about it... \nFor now, let's prioritize fixing that device.
好，裝置啟動成功了。=Okay, the device successfully started.
前方有陰影……\n看看有沒有繞路吧……=There's a Shadow ahead... Let's see if there's a way around...
和剛才飛走的那本書很像……=It looks like the book that flew away earlier...
看上去你好像遇到麻煩了。\n來吧，快坐上來。=You seem to be in trouble. Here, hop on.
它是要載我們過去嗎……？\n試試看吧……=Is it going to carry us across...? Let's try it...
小心別掉下去啊，\n務必要注意安全。=Be careful not to fall, safety first.

哦哦！？變回原狀了！\n是因為地上這個東西嗎？=Whoa!? We're back to normal! \nIs it because of this thing on the ground?
好像是這樣。\n雖然原理不太明白……=It seems like that's the case. \nAlthough I don't really understand why...
你們……能聊聊嗎？=You... can we talk?
{{A}}？啊，是在跟我們說話嗎？={{A}}? Ah, are you talking to us?
應該沒有其他人了吧。\n那些男公關沒辦法處理了麼？=There's no one else here, right? Can't you handle those hosts?
應該沒有其他人了吧。\n那些男公關沒辦法處理了嗎？=There's no one else here, right? Can't you handle those hosts?
雖然我很想見{{A}}，\n但總是被那些傢伙妨礙……=Although I want to see {{A}}, I'm always bothered by those guys...
我覺得只要讓那些男公關停止聚會，\n問題就能解決了。=I think if we can just stop the hosts from partying, the problem will be solved.
哼……乾脆打倒那些牛郎算了？=Hoom... Perhap we can defeat the hosts?
打倒？這種事能做到嗎？=Defeat them? Can you do that?
以他們的樣子，勸說是很難的……\n雖然粗暴，但應該是最快的方法了。=Given their state, persuasion is difficult... \nIt's rough, but it should be the fastest way.
我們要從哪裡找？=<size\=30>Where do we find them?</size>
他們在哪裡？=Where are they?
因為他們總是把音樂放得很大聲，\n所以應該很容易就能找到。=Since they always play music very loudly, they should be easy to find.
看起來就在那扇門的另一邊。\n準備好了就過去吧。=Looks like they're right beyond that door. \nLet's go when we're ready.

這聲音和音樂……\n沒錯，就是那些牛郎。=That sound and music... \nYes, it's those hosts.
讓我們親手結束這場喧鬧，\n讓這裡恢復正常吧。=Let's end this noise with our own hands and return this place to normal.
好，走吧！=Alright, let's go!
<color\=#ff0000>天崎</color>……不，學習<color\=#ff0000>聖彌</color>哥的樣子\n我們也來炒熱氣氛吧——！=<color\=#ff0000>Amasaki</color>... no, let's follow <color\=#ff0000>Seiya</color>-san's example and heat it up-!
可愛、可愛、超可愛！最棒、最強、最漂亮！\n我們的！公主大人！{{A}}！！=Cute, cute, super cute! The best, the strongest, the most beautiful! Our! Princess! {{A}}!!
什麼情況！？\n你們是誰！？=What's going on!? \nWho are you!?
正嗨著呢，不好意思了，\n讓你們安靜一下吧！=Looks like you're havin' fun, sorry, \nwe'll shut you up!
闖入者！？\n竟敢破壞派對……去死吧！=Intruders!? How dare you ruin the party... Die!
來了，準備戰鬥！=Here they come, prepare for battle!

終於安靜了……\n真是累死人了……=It's finally quiet... That was exhaustin'...
這附近的氣氛也恢復正常了，\n之前鎖著的門應該也開了吧？=The atmosphere around here has returned to normal too. That locked door should be open now, right?
嗯，應該是這樣。=Yes, probably.
我們回去看看那扇鎖著的門吧，\n走嗎，WONDER？=Let's go back and check that locked door. \nShall we go, Wonder?
回去吧=Let's go back
再探索一下周圍=<size\=25>Let's explore the surroundings</size>
明白。聽你的。=Understood. As you wish.
果然門開了！\n不過，剛才排隊的工蟻都去哪了？=The door's open! But where did all the queuing worker ants go?
可能都進房間裡了吧？=Maybe they went inside the room?
這是什麼……？\n工蟻們好像都不在……=What's this...? \nThe worker ants seem to be gone...
畫有點詭異。而且……=That painting is a bit eerie. And...
好像在動。\n看來不只是普通的畫。=It seems to be moving. \nThis is not just an ordinary painting.
想要覲見{{A}}嗎……？=Do you wish to have an audience with {{A}}...?
什麼！？\n剛剛這幅畫裡傳出聲音了……！？=What!? A voice just came from this paintin'...!?
喂，喂！突然這樣……！=Hey, hey! What are you...!
畫裡面有空間=<size\=22>There's space inside the painting</size>
前面可能有房間=<size\=25>There might be a room ahead</size>
有點驚險……不過看來沒有危險。\n先進去吧。=That's alarming... but it doesn't seem dangerous. Let's go in.
有點驚險……不過看來沒有危險。\n先進去看看吧。=That's alarming... but it doesn't seem dangerous. Let's go in.

寬敞的房間……\n而且這幅畫也好大啊……=What a massive room... \nAnd that painting's huge...
想要覲見{{A}}的人啊……\n到這裡來吧。=Those who wish to have an audience with {{A}}... come forth.
若想繼續前進，就回答問題，\n證明你對{{A}}有深刻的理解……=If you wish to proceed, answer the questions, and prove your deep understanding of {{A}}...
哈？為什麼我們要做這種事……不過，\n不答就不能前進吧……可惡！=Huh? Why do we have to do this... But, we can't proceed if we don't answer... Damn!
那麼問題是，{{A}}經常去的\n「牛郎俱樂部的名字」是？=Then the question is, the name of the host club that {{A}} frequents is?
嗯……牛郎俱樂部的名字嗎……=Hoom... The host club's name...
完全不知道啊……\nLUCE有頭緒嗎？=I have no idea... \nDoes Luce have any clue?
不知道啊……不，等一下。\n好像在哪聽過……=I don't know... No, wait. \nI feel like I've heard it somewhere...
我也有印象……=I recall something...
好像有人說過……=<size\=30>I think someone said it...</size>
是的。剛進入這個區域的時候，\n有聽到過。=Yes. When we first entered this area, we heard it.
當時說的店名，應該是……=The club name mentioned at that time was...
「CLUB AGETEKO」="CLUB AGETEKO"
「CLUC SAGETEKO」="CLUC SAGETEKO"
「CLUB ATEKO」="CLUB ATEKO"
不，對不上，好像有點不對……=No, it doesn't match, \nI think that's a bit off...
正確。那麼，進入下一個問題吧。\n{{A}}最喜歡的牛郎名字是？=Correct. Then, onto the next question. The name of {{A}}'s favorite host is?
那種事情我怎麼會知道……啊，不過，\n好像有個男公關報了名字……=How would I know that... Ah, but, I think one of the hosts mentioned a name...
「天崎禮彌」="Reiya Amasaki"
「茅崎聖彌」="Seiya Chigasaki"
「天崎聖彌」="Seiya Amasaki"
那名字是這樣的嗎……？\n總覺得有點不對……=Was that the name...? \nI feel like that's a bit off...
正確。但是……僅憑這種程度，\n還不足以稱得上真正理解{{A}}。=Correct. However... this level alone is not enough to be considered truly understanding {{A}}.
只有真正理解{{A}}的人，\n才能繼續前進。=Only those who truly understand {{A}} may proceed.
前往<color\=#ff0000>「收藏室」</color>，克服試煉。\n然後再回來這裡。=Go to the <color\=#ff0000>Collection Room</color> and overcome the trial. Then return here.
看來問題還沒結束啊……\n不過，為什麼要讓人做這種事……=It seems the questions aren't over yet... \nBut, why make people do this...?
只是我的猜測……也許\n她只想把「理解自己的人」留在身邊吧。=This is just my guess... Maybe she only wants to keep those who "understand her" close.
「理解自己的人」嗎……說白了就是對\n自己有利的棋子罷了。總之，繼續走吧。="Those who understand her"... Frankly, they're just pawns useful to her. Anyway, let's keep going.

看來到了新區域……=It seems we've reached a new area...
這裡是不是也有像之前區域一樣的\n回答提示呢？=I wonder if there are answer hints here like in the previous area?
好像剛才提到去「收藏室」……\n可那到底在哪……=It mentioned going to the "Collection Room" just now... But where is that exactly...?
大家，看那邊……=Everyone, look over there...
哦，有地圖啊。\n幹得漂亮，LUCE！=Oh, a map. \nNice find, Luce!
根據地圖顯示，「收藏室」應該在\n這個區域的中央。=According to the map, the "Collection Room" should be in the center of this area.
「收藏室」嗎……裡面會有什麼呢？="The Collection Room"... What could be inside?
他說克服試煉之類的話，\n估計不是什麼好地方吧……=They mentioned overcoming trials and such, \nit is probably not a good place...
那也只能去了=Then we can only go
可以的話真不想去……=I'd really rather not go...
嗯嗯，不愧是隊長！\n到這一步只能做好心理準備了！=Yeah, that's our leader! At this point, we just have to prepare ourselves!
這份心情我很理解……但要想繼續前進，\n除此之外別無選擇。=I understand that... But if we want to proceed, we have no other choice.
就是這樣。\n那麼隊長，帶路吧。=That's right. Then leader, please lead the way.

啊！從那邊可以看到外面！=Ah! You can see outside from over there!
嗯……已經到相當高的地方了。=Hmm... We're already quite high up.
是啊……{{A}}的氣息也越來越近了。=Yes... The {{A}}'s presence is getting closer too.
唔，WONDER！\n門上標著特殊的舞姿圖案……=Hoom, Wonder! The door is marked with a special dance pattern...

看起來和剛才看到的畫一樣……=It looks the same as the painting we saw earlier...
完全沒反應啊……看來得把\n畫框兩側的結晶激活才行……=There's no reaction... It seems we need to activate the crystals on both sides of the frame...
完全沒反應啊……看來得把\n畫框兩側的結晶啟動才行……=There's no reaction... It seems we need to activate the crystals on both sides of the frame...
這種顏色的結晶還是第一次見。\n難道可以用在之前的畫上？=This color of crystal is new. Maybe we can use it on the previous painting?
嗯，值得一試。=Right, worth a try.
回到畫所在的位置，趕緊試試這個\n新的費洛蒙能量吧……=Let's go back to where the painting is and quickly try this new pheromone energy...
紫色費洛蒙能量恢復了。=Recovered purple pheromones energy.
WONDER，試試新的費洛蒙子彈吧！=Wonder, let's try the new pheromone bullet!
WONDER，畫框好像被紫色費洛蒙激活了！=Wonder, the frame seems to be activated by purple pheromones!
WONDER，畫框好像被紫色費洛蒙啟動了！=Wonder, the frame seems to be activated by purple pheromones!
太好了！成功了！=Great! It worked!
看來這幅畫通向另一個房間。=It seems this painting leads to another room.
沒錯。先進去吧。=Right. Let's go in.
沒錯。先進去看看吧。=Right. Let's go in.
有一幅畫著寶箱的畫……\n不過沒有反應。=There's a painting of a treasure chest... But there's no reaction.
試試紫色的費洛蒙能量吧……=Let's try the purple pheromone energy...
今天也要嗨起來～！\n一切都是為了{{A}}～！=Let's get hype today too～! \nEverything for {{A}}～!
可愛、可愛、超可愛！最棒、最強、最漂亮！\n我們的！公主大人！{{A}}！=Cute, cute, super cute! The best, the strongest, the most beautiful! Our! Princess! {{A}}!
唔，身體變得好僵硬！=Hoom, my body is feeling stiff!
唔，身體變的好僵硬……！=Hoom, my body is feeling stiff...!
啊，可惡……又變成這副模樣！=Ah, damn it... We've turned into this again!
這樣就不能戰鬥了……\n得趕快找到變回去的方法。=We can't fight like this... We need to quickly find a way to change back.

有幾個櫃子看起來能動……=There are some shelves that look like they can be moved...
哇，能夠操作的機關顯示出來了=Hoo, that displayed the mechanism!
哇，能夠操作的機關顯示出來了。=Hoo, that displayed the mechanism!
哇，能夠操作的機關顯示出來了！=Hoo, that displayed the mechanism!
櫃子動起來了！=The shelves moved!
Bravo！這樣就能過去了！=Bravo! Now we can get through!
這幅畫也需要被激活啊。\n但保持這模樣的話……=This painting needs to be activated too. \nBut if we stay like this...
這幅畫也需要被啟動啊。\n但保持這模樣的話……=This painting needs to be activated too. \nBut if we stay like this...
是啊。必須先恢復原狀才行。=Yes. We need to revert to normal first.
那邊的畫看起來能通過。\n去看看吧。=That painting over there looks passable. \nLet's take a look.
櫃子旋轉起來了！=The shelves are rotating!
啊，身體恢復正常了！=Ah, we're back to normal!

這樣應該就能使用費洛蒙能量了……\n回去吧。=Now we should be able to use the pheromone energy... Let's go back.
終於看見出口了～\n簡直就像迷宮一樣。=Finally, the exit is in sight～ \nIt was like a maze.
快到「收藏室」了。\n走吧，大家！=We're almost at the "Collection Room." \nLet's go, everyone!
我一上初中就向{{A}}告白了，\n但被拒絕了……好像有人先告白了。=I confessed to {{A}} when I started middle school, but was rejected... Apparently someone else confessed first.
哇，突然說話了！\n這是怎麼回事……？=Whoa, it started talking! \nWhat's going on...?
也許是這本雜誌封面上的男性的認知存在\n被變成了雜誌……=Maybe the cognitive being of the man on this magazine cover was turned into a magazine...
是那個魔法棒……不，可能是錄音筆吧。\n也有可能。=It's that magic wand... or maybe that voice recorder? That's possible too.
{{A}}炫耀自己受歡迎嗎？\n這種事無視就行了吧。=Is {{A}} boastin' about her popularity? Let's just ignore this.
等等。說不定和問題的答案有關。\n還是調查一下比較好。=Wait. It might be related to the answers for the questions. We should investigate.
被{{A}}甩了……後來聽說，\n向她告白的男生，我竟然是<color\=#ff0000>第10個</color>……=Rejected by {{A}}... Later I heard I was the <color\=#ff0000>10th</color> boy to confess to her...
在初中畢業前夕，我向{{A}}告白了……\n<color\=#ff0000>結果除我之外，還有13人</color>也向她告白過……=Just before middle school graduation, I confessed to {{A}}... <color\=#ff0000>Turns out 13 others besides me</color> had also confessed to her...
真是一如既往吵死了……\n趕緊收拾掉吧！=As noisy as ever... \nLet's take care of them quickly!
一口氣解決！=<size\=28>Let's finish this in one go!</size>
派對時間到！=Party time!
什麼！？你們是入侵者！？=What!? You're intruders!?
上次也是這樣，打倒他們、停止音樂之後，\n區域的狀態就會發生變化。=Just like last time, after we defeat them and stop the music, the state of the area changes.
是啊。看來區域變化的原因\n不是陰影，而是音樂。=Yes. It seems the cause of the area change isn't the Shadows, but the music.
原來如此……那就是說……=I see... So that means...
看來這是播放音樂的裝置。\n也許能用得上。=It seems this is the device playing the music. \nIt might come in handy.
{{A}}說得對，可能會有用。\n帶上吧……={{A}}'s right, it might be useful. Let's take it...
根據地圖，這前方就是「收藏室」。=According to the map, the "Collection Room" is ahead.
裡面會有什麼呢……\n果然很危險嗎？=What's inside... \nIs it dangerous?
不進去就不知道……\n保持警戒前進吧。=We won't know until we go in... \nLet's proceed with caution.

Meet Shimotsuna's Parents
----------
哇……！？這是什麼房間！=Wow...!? What room is this!?
都是女孩子的照片？\n有小女生的，和穿學生服的……=They're all photos of girls? Some are little kids, some in school uniforms...
這些都是{{A}}的照片！！=These are all photos of {{A}}!!
{{A}}啊，是我們超可愛超可愛的女兒哦！={{A}} is our super, super cute daughter!
女兒……？\n也就是說，他們是……？=Daughter...? That is to say, they are...?
{{A}}父母的認知存在嗎？=<size\=22>Cognitive beings of {{A}}'s parents</size>
她的家人是跟蹤狂嗎？=<size\=26>Are her family members stalkers?</size>
Choice 1
是吧……還有這海量的照片，\n應該都是{{A}}小時候的吧？=That's right... And I wonder if these countless photos are from {{A}}'s childhood.
她把過去裝飾得光彩奪目，是想美化自己吧。\n自我表現慾達到極點了啊。=She's decorating her past to glorify herself, I suppose. Her narcissism knows no bounds.
Choice 2
啊……\n我覺得並非如此吧。=Ah... I don't really think that's the case.
這些應該是{{A}}小時候的照片……=These should be photos from {{A}}'s childhood...
父母通常會在家裡掛一些，\n自己孩子的照片吧……=Parents usually hang some photos of their children at home, right...
不過……就算是父母，\n這些照片的數量也太多了吧……=But... even for parents, this number of photos is just too much...
恐怕是{{A}}過強的自我表現慾，\n才讓房間變成這樣。=I'm afraid it's {{A}}'s boundless narcissism that made the room like this.
父親的認知存在=Cognitive Father
你們是新的工作人員嗎？\n{{B}}，謝謝你們為{{A}}工作！=Are you the new staff? \n{{B}}, thank you for working for {{A}}!
{{A}}是個好孩子吧！\n你們都發自肺腑地想為她賣命吧？={{A}}-chan is a good kid, right! You all genuinely want to work your hardest for her, right?
誰想啊！=Who would want that!
算了……這裡就隨便配合一下吧，SOY。\n爭到最後也是我們自己吃虧。=Well... let's just play along here, Soy. \nArguing till the end will only cause us trouble.
看這裡！\n這張照片是{{A}}6歲時拍的哦！=Look here! This photo was taken when {{A}}-chan was 6 years old!
她說想要一件公主裙，\n於是我就買給她了！多可愛啊！=She said she wanted a princess dress, \nso I bought it for her! How cute!
嗯嗯。{{A}}從那時起就很優秀，\n不管是學習還是運動都很棒。=Yes. {{A}} was excellent even back then, \ngreat at both studies and sports.
看那裡，那個金牌是她在跑步比賽裡贏的！=Look over there, that gold medal is from a running competition she won!
看那邊，那個金牌是她在跑步比賽裡贏的！=Look over there, that gold medal is from a running competition she won!
跑步比賽的金牌……？=A gold medal from a running competition...?
那邊有一枚用厚紙板做的金牌……=There's a gold medal made of cardboard...
{{A}}在匯報演出上彈鋼琴也超級可愛呢。={{A}} was super cute when she played the piano at the recital too.
{{A}}在彙報演出上彈鋼琴也超級可愛呢。={{A}} was super cute when she played the piano at the recital too.
{{A}}，那束玫瑰花，\n是你當時送給她的吧？={{A}}, that bouquet of roses, \nyou gave it to her back then, right?
{{A}}在文藝演出裡當主角的時候也很可愛呢。={{A}} was also very cute when she was the lead in the school play.
那張照片是她中學的入學典禮。\n她考上的是名校哦！=That photo is from her middle school entrance ceremony. She got into a prestigious school!
聰明又可愛，\n{{A}}真是完美的孩子啊！=Both smart and cute, \n{{A}} is just a perfect child!
這倆人真是誇個沒完啊……=These two really won't stop praisin'...
這些照片也是{{A}}的……認知吧？\n那她一定是在父母的愛護下長大的吧？=These photos are also part of {{A}}'s... cognition, right? So she must have grown up loved by her parents?
看她現在，倒長成個相當糟糕的大人了。=Lookin' at her now, she turned into a terrible adult.
看她現在，反而變成一個相當糟糕的大人了。=Lookin' at her now, she turned into a terrible adult.
是啊……可能正是這種溺愛，\n才把{{A}}給寵壞了，讓她變得這麼{{B}}。=Yes... It might be precisely this kind of doting that spoiled {{A}} and made her so prideful.
父母愛孩子是好事，\n但過度溺愛就適得其反了啊。=Parents loving their children is good, \nbut excessive doting will backfire.
確實！這對父母看起來，\n就是那種超級溺愛孩子的類型！=Exactly! These parents look like the super doting type!
這就是「不批評教育」的壞處吧。\n人活著還是需要教養啊。=So this is the downside of that "no-scolding" parenting style. People need to be taught how to behave.
嗯，既然她能順利通過中學考試，\n拿那麼多獎盃和獎狀……=Well, since she passed her middle school exams smoothly and got so many trophies and certificates...
她應該也算個優秀的孩子吧。=She probably was a quite outstanding child, right?
所以她直到現在，\n幾乎都沒經歷過什麼挫折啊……=So, until now, she's hardly experienced any setbacks...
{{B}}，{{A}}從小就很受男孩子喜歡呢。={{B}}, {{A}}-chan has been popular with boys since she was little.
沒錯，從幼兒園開始就超受歡迎的！\n到了中學以後，男朋友一個接一個！=That's right, she was super popular since kindergarten! After starting middle school, she had boyfriend after boyfriend!
沒錯，從幼稚園開始就超受歡迎的！\n到了中學以後，男朋友一個接一個！=That's right, she was super popular since kindergarten! After starting middle school, she had boyfriend after boyfriend!
好了，好了……\n不想再聽這種話了。=Alright, alright... \nI don't wanna hear any more of this.
呵，信不信由你，\n你可以去那個房間看看。=Oh, believe it or not, \nyou can go to that room and take a look.
房間？=Room?
都是證明{{A}}很受歡迎的證據哦！\n看了你就能馬上明白了。=It's full of proof of how popular {{A}}-chan is! You'll understand immediately once you see it.
嗯，快去看看吧！\n你會更加體會到{{A}}有多麼優秀的！=Yes, go take a look quickly! You'll appreciate even more how wonderful {{A}} is!
不感興趣……=Not interested...
誰要去看啊=<size\=25>Who would want to see that?</size>
哎，我才不想體會那種東西呢。=Yeah, I don't wanna experience that.
等一下。了解她這個人怎麼樣，\n對攻略{{A}}也很重要。=Wait. Understanding what kind of person she is is also important for {{A}} infiltration.
尤其是跟過去有關的事，\n在認知{{A}}裡可能是突破封鎖的關鍵哦。=Especially things related to her past might be the key to breaking through blockades in cognitive strongholds.
雖然我不知道她自以為的「受歡迎歷史」，\n是不是攻略的關鍵……=Although I'm not sure if her self-perceived "history of popularity" is the key to infiltration...
但不管怎麼樣，我們得找通往樓上的路。\n雖然不太願意，但還是去看看吧。=Regardless, we need to find a route to the upper floors. I don't really want to, but let's go and take a look.

這這這、這是什麼啊！？=Wh-Wh-What is all this!?
是……屍體嗎！？=Are those... corpses!?
好可怕！=So scary!
大、大、大家冷靜點！=<size\=30>Ev-Ev-Everyone, calm down!</size>
這是……認知存在？=<size\=26>Are these... cognitive beings?</size>
Choice 1
大家冷靜點。\n這裡是{{A}}，怎麼可能會有死人呢。=Everyone, calm down. This is the {{A}}, there's no way there are corpses here.
嗯，這些看起來不是陰影，\n應該同樣是認知存在吧……=Hoom, these don't look like Shadows, they're probably cognitive beings too..
數量這麼多，全都一動不動地站著，\n確實挺詭異的。=But there are so many, all standing completely still... it is creepy indeed.
Choice 2
隊長你也冷靜點。\n這裡是{{A}}，估計這是……=Leader, you calm down too. This is the {{A}}, so those are probably...
嗯，這不是死屍，應該是認知存在吧。=Hoom, these aren't corpses, they're probably cognitive beings.
Choice 3
嗯……我覺得應該是吧……=Hoom... I think so too...
紋絲不動。比起認知存在，\n更像是人體模型或者蠟像啊，真是……=Not moving a muscle. They're more like mannequins or wax figures than cognitive beings...
這些男的到底是誰……？=Who are all these men...?
{{B}}，他們都是{{A}}的歷任男朋友哦！={{B}}, they're all of {{A}}'s ex-boyfriends!
啊！又出現了！=Ah! They showed up again!
我說過有證據吧？\n他們就是證據！{{A}}受歡迎的證據！=I told you there was proof, right? This is the proof! Proof of {{A}}-chan's popularity!
{{B}}受到了男朋友們，和我們大家的喜愛！\n可愛的可愛的{{A}}！={{B}} was loved by her boyfriends and all of us! Cute, cute {{A}}!
不是，不管有多受歡迎，\n也別這麼擺出來啊……=No, no matter how much it proves her popularity, don't display them like this...
這些男朋友們，\n對{{A}}來說可能就像獎盃一樣吧。=These boyfriends... to {{A}}, they're probably like trophies.
居然把自己的前男友們當做「勳章」？\n這是什麼鬼……真不懂啊……=Treatin' her ex-boyfriends as "medals"? \nWhat the heck... I just don't get it...
{{B}}。這孩子啊，\n是{{A}}從班上的女同學那裡搶過來的哦。={{B}}. This kid here? {{A}}-chan took him from a female classmate of hers.
搶過來……？=Took...?
啊……我有不好的預感了。=Ah... I have a bad feeling about this.
那個女孩是班級委員，一副領導做派，\n得意洋洋的真讓人討厭～=That girl was the class representative, acting all leader-like and smug, so annoying～
所以{{A}}就去找{{B}}報告了，\n說她考試作弊哦！=So {{A}} went and told the teacher that she cheated on an exam!
結果她在班裡被孤立，男生們也都討厭她，\n最後還轉學了……{{A}}，真是活該！=She was isolated in class and the boys started hating her too. Eventually, she transferred to another school... {{A}}, serves her right!
居然轉學了！？=She transferred schools!?
一定是內心被傷透了……\n居然說什麼「活該」……！=Her heart must have been broken... \nand you say "serves her right"...!
這個是中學時的男朋友吧。=This one was her boyfriend in middle school, right?
他居然和醜八怪發小談戀愛，\n真是白瞎了那副帥氣的模樣啊……=He was dating his ugly childhood friend, what a waste of his good looks...
他居然和醜八怪青梅竹馬談戀愛，\n真是白瞎了那副帥氣的模樣啊……=He was dating his ugly childhood friend, \nwhat a waste of his good looks...
所以{{A}}把他搶走了哦，\n他和那女的都應該感激{{A}}呢！=So {{A}}-chan took him away! \nBoth he and that girl should be grateful!
稍微在班上的女生之間傳了點小道消息，\n那個女的馬上就被欺負了。=She just spread some rumors among the girls in class, and that girl immediately started getting bullied.
小道消息？被欺負？=Rumors? Bullied?
之後那孩子就不來學校了對吧？\n然後{{A}}就把來找她的男朋友給拿下了喲！=After that, she stopped coming to school, right? And then {{A}}-chan comforted the guy who came to her and conquered him!
真聰明啊，我們家{{A}}！=So clever, our {{A}}-chan!
聰明？哪裡聰明瞭！？\n那小道消息，多半是……胡說八道的吧！=Clever? How is that clever!? \nThose rumors were probably... all lies!
聰明？哪裡聰明了！？\n那小道消息，多半是……胡說八道的吧！=Clever? How is that clever!? \nThose rumors were probably... all lies!
胡說八道？那有什麼關係嘛。=Lies? What does it matter?
和{{A}}交往他才會更幸福！\n嗯，沒錯，肯定是這樣！=He'll be happier dating {{A}}-chan! \nYes, that's right, definitely!
過分……搞得別人都不敢上學了……\n做父母的好歹應該教訓一下她吧……！=That's horrible... making someone unable to come to school... Shouldn't the parents at least scold her for this...!
哎呀，我們什麼都不知道哦！\n{{A}}她一直都是好孩子呀～！=Ara, we don't know anything about that! {{A}}-chan has always been a good girl～!
我們不需要生氣啊！\n{{A}}根本沒有做錯什麼！=We have no reason to be angry! \n{{A}} didn't do anything wrong at all!
這……雖然認知中的父母，\n交代了{{A}}之前的惡行……=This... although the cognitive parents revealed {{A}}'s past misdeeds...
但恐怕在現實中，她父母還並不知道這些，\n也從沒責備過她……=In reality, her parents probably still don't know about these things and have never scolded her for them...
從小就說謊、看不起別人……\n大人們還一直都沒發現。=Lyin' and lookin' down on others since she was little... and the adults never noticed.
而且……恐怕不只這些情感糾紛。=And... probably it's not just these romantic entanglements.
她一定也用這種卑劣的手段，\n把其他礙事的人給處理掉了吧。=She must have used similar underhanded methods to get rid of other people who were in her way.
竟然做了這種事……=<size\=24>To think she did these things...</size>
到底有多少受害者……=<size\=26>Just how many victims are there...</size>
嗯～？你在說什麼呢？=Hmm～? What are you talking about?
根本就沒必要生氣吧！\n{{A}}她沒有做錯任何事！=There's no need to be angry at all! \n{{A}} didn't do anything wrong!
對！{{A}}做的事都是理所當然的哦！=Yes! Everything {{A}}-chan did was only natural!
……真讓人噁心。=...This is disgusting.
這是{{A}}，\n正是她內心無所遁形的地方……=This is {{A}}, a place where her inner self is laid bare...
在這裡，她就像是在炫耀一樣，\n把從小到大的惡行擺出來講。=Here, it is as if she's boasting, openly talking about the misdeeds she has committed since childhood.
是的，{{A}}打從心底裡認為，\n她自己的行為「並沒有什麼錯」。=Yes, {{A}} genuinely believes, from the bottom of her heart, that her actions "aren't wrong at all."
她根本讜有一點道德感，\n欺負同學、搶走別人的男朋友……=She has no sense of morality whatsoever. Bullying classmates, talking others' boyfriends...
她根本沒有一點道德感，\n欺負同學、搶走別人的男朋友……=She has no sense of morality whatsoever. Bullying classmates, talking others' boyfriends...
「因為想要就伸手去拿」……\n就是這麼簡單吧。="If I want it, I just take it"... \nit is that simple to her.
然後她就真的得到了。\n對她來說，這是值得炫耀的「成果」。=And she actually got them. To her, these are "achievements" worth boasting about.
……真是太差勁了！=...That's horrible!
雖說這世道的確是弱肉強食，\n但這也太過分了……=Although the world does operate on survival of the fittest to some extent, this is just too much...
從那麼小的時候起，就一直在堆積「謊言」，\n傷害周圍的人嗎……！=She's been building a foundation of "lies" since she was that young, hurting people around her...!
沒有被父母斥責過，\n從小就累積著扭曲的成功經驗……=Never scolded by her parents, accumulating twisted experiences of "success" since childhood...
最終，誕生了一個完全沒有罪惡感的人。\n一個名為{{A}}的怪物。=Ultimately, it gave birth to a person completely devoid of guilt. A monster named {{A}}.
說實話，吾也很驚訝。\n儘管她已經扭曲得不成樣子了……=To be honest, even I am surprised. \nAs distorted as she is...
但在這個慾望漸漸消失的世界裡，\n還有人慾望……惡意這麼旺盛，令人震驚。=In this world of fading desires, it's shocking that someone's desire... their malice... could be so rampant.
但在這個慾望漸漸消失的世界裡，\n還有人的慾望……惡意這麼旺盛，令人震驚。=In this world of fading desires, it's shocking that someone's desire... their malice... could be so rampant.
這樣的話，\n應該有數不勝數的人被她剝奪了慾望吧。=In that case, there must be countless people whose desires she has stolen.
{{B}}，你們難道是在指責{{A}}嗎？={{B}}, are you criticizing {{A}}?
有點可疑啊，你們真的是工作人員嗎……=You're a bit suspicious, \nare you really staff members...?
額，糟了。好像引起對方警戒了。\n這樣下去可能會引發戰鬥啊。=This is bad. They seem to be getting wary. \nThis might lead to a fight.
哼，管他呢！\n這些女兒奴真的要讓我噁心死了！=Hmph, whatever! These dotin' parents are makin' me sick to my stomach!
幹了！=Let's do this!
上了！=Let's do this!
大家準備！=Everyone, get ready!
哈！！=Ha!!
{{C}}！{{C}}！{{B}}！\n最棒！最美！{{A}}！={{C}}! {{C}}! Hey hey hey hey! The best! The most beautiful! {{A}}!
嚇死我了！？怎麼突然這樣！？=What!? What's happening all of a sudden!?
男、男性認知存在全都……\n這是什麼情況？=Th-The male cognitive beings are all... \nWhat's going on?
噢，{{A}}好像快來了！=Oh, it seems {{A}} is about to arrive!
我們也得喊口號歡迎她！=We have to chant slogans to welcome her too!
這是什麼情況啊……=What in the world is this situation...
照他們的說法，\n是{{A}}就要來了……的意思吧？=According to what they're saying, it means {{A}} is about to arrive, right?
去看看=Let's go see
先藏起來=Let's hide first
Choice 1
嗯，我們去看看情況，\n不過得小心點，別讓{{A}}發現了。=Yes, let's go check the situation, but we need to be careful not to let {{A}} spot us.
Choice 2
嗯，現在還沒確認{{B}}路線，\n被{{A}}發現就糟了。=Yes, we haven't located a route to the {{B}} yet. It would be bad if {{A}} discovered us.
不過……這也許能帶來一些攻略線索。\n我們先藏起來，觀察{{A}}的動向吧。=But... this might provide some clues for infiltration. Let's hide and observe {{A}}.

牛郎陰影們=Host Shadows
給我您的愛！再愛我多一點！\n可愛！超可愛！我們最愛公主大人～=Give me your love! Love me more! Cute! Super cute! Our favorite princess～
哈～～～～～=Hah～～～～～
真吵！\n我知道我很可愛啦！=So noisy! \nOf course I know I'm cute!
謝謝您～公主大人！=Thank you～ Princess!
哼！=Hmph!
{{B}}，真煩死了，煩死了……\n{{A}}那傢伙！真是氣死人了！！={{B}}, so annoying, so annoying... \nThat {{A}}! He makes me so mad!!
叫{{B}}過來！\n{{A}}！！！=Call {{B}} here! \n{{A}}!!!
順從的陰影=Obedient Shadow
是！=Yes!
{{A}}，LUCE……！？={{A}}, Luce...!?
不，那是認知存在。\n真正的我還在這裡呢。=No, that's a cognitive being. \nThe real me is still here.
我是不會向你屈服的！=I won't submit to you!
哈～～？你以為你有資格那麼說嗎？\n我可是{{A}}！=Hah～～? You think you have the right to say that? I am {{A}}!
我爸媽不是有毒父母……\n媽媽也不是那種爛女人……=My parents are not toxic... My mom is not that kind of horrible woman either...
我是在讓你清醒過來呢！\n這個垃圾！垃圾！垃圾！=I'm making you see reason! \nYou trash! Trash! Trash!
而且你還把我最重要的錄音筆弄壞了！=And you broke my most important voice recorder!
說「我要做你的狗」，快點、快點、快點！=Say "I'll become your dog," hurry, hurry, hurry!
是，我……我要做你的狗……=Yes, I... I'll become your dog.
{{A}}！\n我錄下來了哦！！={{A}}! I recorded it!!
LUCE！=Luce!
放心放心，那不是我。=Don't worry, that's not me.
但是……！=But...!
CLOSER真善良啊。\n你不用擔心，我本人並沒受傷。=Closer, you're so kind. You don't need to worry, I myself am not hurt.
比起那個，快看那根魔法棒。=More importantly, look at that magic wand.
啊，是那個「魔法錄音筆」。\n居然又出現了……=Ah, that "magic voice recorder." \nIt showed up again...
怎麼樣？你弄壞的錄音筆已經修好了，\n看吧，完好如初。=Well? The voice recorder you broke is fixed now. See, it's as good as new.
你很快就會是我的了。{{A}}……=You'll be mine soon. {{A}}...
W、WIND居然退這麼遠……\n我還是第一次見呢。=W-Wind actually backed away that far... \nI've never seen that before.
雖然是認知存在，\n但還是有點後悔拋下那個LUCE了。=Even though it's just a cognitive being, I still feel a bit bad for leaving that Luce behind.
我不是說過了嘛，你不用在意啦。\n更重要的是……=I told you, you don't need to mind it. \nMore importantly...
嗯，修好的「魔法錄音筆」才是問題所在。=Hoom, the repaired "magic voice recorder" is the real problem.
現實中她認定那是「壓迫他人的力量象徵」，\n所以它再次出現也不奇怪了……=In reality, she sees it as a "symbol of the power to oppress others," so it's not strange for it to reappear...
那樣的話，\n碰到{{A}}就太危險了……=In that case, encountering {{A}} would be too dangerous...
原來如此……！\n如果當時我衝出去了……=I see...! If I had rushed out then...
可能會被拿到什麼把柄，然後被變成書吧。=You might've given her some leverage and been turned into a book.
啊，真險啊……=Ah, that was close...
{{A}}可能還在附近遊蕩……\n怎麼辦，隊長？={{A}} might still be lurkin' nearby... What should we do, Leader?
我們回現實去吧=<size\=26>Let's return to the real world</size>
在基地商量對策吧=<size\=27>Let's discuss at the hideout</size>
嗯，{{A}}的決定。\n我們先返回現實，再商量對策吧。=Hoom, a wise decision. Let's return to the real world first and then discuss our strategy.
現在「魔法錄音筆」在她手上，\n我們不能輕易開戰。=Right now, she has the 'magic voice recorder" in her possession. We can't start a fight recklessly.
只能先返回現實了。=We have no choice but to return to the real world for now.

Chapter 4 Part 3 Palace Part 3 End
----------
可惡，真生氣。\n居然不得不在{{A}}面前逃跑……=Damn it, I'm so angry. To think we had to run away from {{A}}...
下次見面時，\n得想好和她戰鬥的對策才行。=The next time we meet, we need to have a strategy ready for fightin' her.
嗯，當然要想好怎麼對付「魔法錄音筆」，\n另外也得想辦法對付那些認知存在。=Yes. Of course, we need to figure out how to deal with the "magic voice recorder" and those cognitive beings.
之前的{{B}}就是個強敵……\n而這次連{{A}}的父母都冒出來了。=That {{B}}-san from before was a tough enemy... and this time, even {{A}}'s parents showed up.
那今天我們怎麼辦？來都來了，\n要不去家庭餐廳什麼的商量一下作戰計劃？=So, what should we do today? Since we're already here, should we go to a diner or something to discuss our strategy?
那今天我們怎麼辦？來都來了，\n要不去家庭餐廳什麼的商量一下作戰計畫？=So, what should we do today? Since we're already here, should we go to a diner or something to discuss our strategy?
不了，我理解你們急切的心情，\n但今晚大家都很疲憊了吧。=No. I understand everyone's eagerness, \nbut you all must be pretty tired tonight.
明天再進行作戰會議吧，\n今天就先回去休息。=Let's hold the strategy meeting tomorrow. \nFor today, let's all go home and rest.
嗯，確實……那就這麼辦吧。=Yes, you're right... \nLet's do that.
{{A}}，怎麼了？看你臉色有點不好。={{A}}, what's wrong? You look a bit pale.
啊，沒事……確實是有點累了。=Ah, it's nothing... I'm just a bit tired.
我去附近吃完飯再回去。\n那就先走了！=I'm going to get something to eat nearby before heading home. See you!
那我們也解散吧，大家明天見！=Let's call it a day, see you all tomorrow!

r:"^怎麼了，(.*)，\n你也打算在(.*)吃飯嗎？$"="What's wrong, $1? \nAre you planning to eat in $2 too?"
我有點擔心{{A}}……=<size\=28>I'm worried about {{A}}...</size>
去看看情況=<size\=30>Let's go check on them</size>
唔，{{A}}是去吃飯了對吧？\n我倒覺得沒什麼不對勁的……=Hmm, {{A}} just went to get something to eat, right? I don't think there's anything wrong...
不過，你的擔心也有道理。\n現在他應該是最難受的。=But your concern is understandable. He's probably having the hardest time right now.
吾等也去中央大街看看吧。=Let's go take a look around Center Street too.
哎……果然，這樣太冒險了……=Sigh... As I thought, this is too risky...
他應該是在{{B}}或者{{A}}吧……\n也不知道今晚到底會不會喝酒……=He's probably in {{B}} or {{A}}... \nWho knows if he'll even drink tonight...
還是先查一下那個人的工作安排吧……=Maybe I should check that person's schedule first...
r:"^你怎麼在這裡，(.*)！？$"="$1, what are you doing here!?"
r:"^你怎麼在這兒，(.*)！？$"="$1, what are you doing here!?"
啊！糟了……被發現了。=Ah! Drat... We've been spotted.
你是擔心我才過來的吧？\n啊……真的不好意思。=You came because you were worried about me, didn't you? Ah... I'm really sorry.
看起來你沒去吃飯嘛。\n在這裡幹嘛呢？=Seems like you didn't go to eat. \nWhat are you doing here?
啊……剛才因為{{A}}的那句話，\n我想起了{{B}}的事。=Ah... It's because of what {{A}} said earlier, it made me think about {{B}}'s situation.
你還記得吧，{{A}}的2樓……\n有個全是藝人資料的房間？=You remember, right? On the second floor of {{A}}... there's a room full of industry materials?
你記得吧，{{A}}的2樓……\n有個全是藝人資料的房間？=You remember, right? On the second floor of {{A}}... there's a room full of industry materials?
嗯。就是那個，\n有陷害{{A}}資料的房間吧？=Hoom. The one with the documents framing {{A}}, right?
對，就是那個文件裡寫的。=Right, that's what the file said.
IDL FACTORY的社長，\n毆打了偶像洞口征人。=The president of IDL FACTORY assaulted the idol Yukito Horaguchi.
為了不讓這件事曝光，\n{{A}}退出了當時的組合……=To prevent this from coming to light, \n{{A}} left his group at the time...
然後按照{{A}}說的，\n轉到了「BEAUTIFUL HIGH」。=And then, as {{A}} demanded, \ntransferred to "BEAUTIFUL HIGH."
嗯。我就是想從洞口那裡，\n了解一下當時的情況。=Right. I wanted to ask Horaguchi himself about the situation back then.
{{A}}的認知存在也提過吧。={{A}}'s cognitive being mentioned it too, right?
社長毆打洞口，\n是因為「那個新人偶像被欺負得很慘」。=The president assaulted Horaguchi because "that rookie idol was being abused."
如果是真的……那就是洞口的錯啊。=If that's true... then it was Horaguchi's fault.
所以我在想，能不能幫{{A}}一個忙，\n讓他回到娛樂圈。=So I was thinking, maybe I could help {{A}} and get him back into the industry.
原來如此。所以才在找那傢伙吧？=I see. So that's why you're looking for that guy?
我沒他的聯繫方式。不過聽人說，\n他經常在{{A}}、{{B}}一帶喝酒。=I don't have his contact info. But I heard he often drinks around {{A}} and {{B}}.
所以我想，如果在這附近說不定能找到……\n不過好像有點不靠譜，{{A}}。=So I thought, maybe I could find him around here... but that's a bit unreliable, haha.
確實不太靠譜=<size\=28>It really is a bit unreliable</size>
有沒有更可靠的辦法呢=<size\=30>Is there a more reliable way?</size>
是啊……嗯……=Yeah... Hmm...
在電視台，或演唱會現場之類的地方，\n等著他出來呢……？=Wait for him to come out at a TV station, or a concert venue...?
在電視臺，或演唱會現場之類的地方，\n等著他出來呢……？=Wait for him to come out at a TV station, or a concert venue...?
確實，在電視台或演唱會現場之類的地方，\n等著他出來吧……=Indeed, let's wait for him to come out at a TV station or a concert venue...
確實，在電視臺或演唱會現場之類的地方，\n等著他出來吧……=Indeed, let's wait for him to come out at a TV station or a concert venue...
嗯嗯……\n我們和{{A}}的大家同步一下，商量商量吧。=Hoom... Let's bring this up with the rest of the {{A}} and discuss it.
大家一起想想，或許有更好的辦法。=Perhaps if we all think together, \nwe can find a better way.
是這樣沒錯……不過，\n{{A}}的事畢竟是出於我的私心。=That's true... But, {{A}}'s matter is ultimately my personal desire.
你們也剛從{{A}}回來，一定很累吧， \n我不想把你們牽扯進來。=You all just got back from the {{A}}, you must be tired. I don't want to drag you into this.
別客氣=Don't mention it
又想一個人扛嗎？=<size\=22>Trying to carry it all alone again?</size>
……啊，謝謝。=...Ah, thank you.
怎麼說呢，可能是我的習慣吧。總是想著，\n哪怕辛苦一點，只要自己就能解決的話……=How do I put it, I guess it's just a habit of mine. I always think, if I can solve it myself, even if it's a bit harder...
好，那就按你們說的，\n明天我再和大家商量一下！=Alright, then I'll do as you say. \nI'll discuss it with everyone tomorrow!
嗯，那樣最好。\n今天也晚了，趕緊回去休息吧。=Yes, that's best. It's late today, so let's hurry back and get some rest.
r:"^嗯，抱歉讓你擔心了。\n明天見，(.*)！$"="RIght, sorry for making you worry. \nSee you tomorrow, $1!"
r:"^嗯？怎麼了，(.*)？$"="Hmm? What's wrong, $1?"
希望{{A}}能更依賴我們=<size\=26>I hope {{A}} can rely on us more</size>
他是不是還有什麼顧慮呢……=<size\=26>I wonder if he still has some reservations...</size>
嗯……確實。\n{{A}}似乎還在對我們這些夥伴有所顧慮……=Hoom... Indeed. It seems {{A}} still has some reservations about relying on us, his teammates...
大概是因為他太體貼了吧。\n但是如果一直自己扛，反而會更痛苦。=It's probably because he's too considerate. But if he keeps bearing it all himself, it'll only become more painful.
希望能有個機會讓{{A}}放下顧慮，\n毫不猶豫地依賴吾等……=I hope we can find a chance for {{A}} to let go of his reservations and rely on us without hesitation...
嗯？你那表情，是想到了什麼嗎？=Hoom? That look on your face... did you think of something?
r:"^(.*)，看起來很自信啊。\n我很期待你的想法，(.*)。$"="$1, you look confident. I am looking forward to hearing your idea."

Chapter 4 Part 3 Day 2
----------
嗯……直接找歌手洞口征人問話……=Going directly to ask the singer Yukito Horaguchi...
他之前說自己遭到暴行，\n結果{{A}}沒有報導，反而給壓了下來對吧？=I'm pretty sure that guy testified to {{A}} he was assaulted, and she buried his testimony instead of reporting it. Right?
對。=Right.
只不過，{{A}}用這件事來威脅{{B}}了……=It's just that {{A}} used this incident to threaten {{B}}-san...
也許是在讓洞口閉嘴=<size\=21>Maybe she also silenced Horaguchi</size>
洞口也知道威脅的事嗎？=<size\=23>Does Horaguchi know about the threat?</size>
Choice 1
……是啊。\n洞口本人是受害者，沒理由保持沉默。=...Yes. Horaguchi himself was the victim, he has no reason to remain silent.
不過，如果公開了，\n就沒有當做籌碼的價值了。=Unless, if it's made public, it loses its value as leverage.
這樣的話，\n{{A}}很可能會讓洞口閉嘴。=If that's the case, it's highly likely that {{A}} was trying to keep Horaguchi quiet.
Choice 2
可能性很高呢……=The probability is high...
原本洞口本人就是暴行的受害者，\n沒理由保持沉默啊。=Originally, Horaguchi himself was the victim of assault, he has no reason to remain silent.
除非是想拿這件事當做籌碼，\n{{A}}可能威脅洞口讓他保持沉默。=Unless she wanted to use it as leverage, {{A}} probably threatened Horaguchi into silence.
是封口的意思嗎……！=You mean she silenced him...!
也就是說，如果洞口能作證，\n說{{A}}威脅他不要公開暴行事件的話……=So, if Horaguchi can testify that {{A}} threatened him not to disclose the assault incident...
沒錯。那就能證明，\n{{A}}一個人背負了所有的責任！=Yes. Then we can prove that {{A}} alone took on all the responsibility!
而且，如果能把這事告訴原事務所的老闆，\n或者團隊裡的人……=Also, if we can tell the president of his former agency, or his former group members...
{{A}}也許就能像以前一樣，\n重新開始活動了！={{A}} might be able to resume his activities like before!
不過，問題是怎麼找到洞口征人，\n並從他那裡獲得證言……=But the problem is how to find Yukito Horaguchi and get his testimony...
看看這個。{{A}}的一個爵士俱樂部，\n今晚有某個歌手的現場演出。=Look at this. A jazz club in Kichijoji has a live performance by a certain singer tonight.

{{B}}，這麼短時間就查出來了！\n不愧是{{A}}……！={{B}}, did you look it up already! \nAs expected from {{A}}...!
嗯，雖然現在買不到票了……\n但在外面等的話，或許可以見到他。=Well, although we can't get tickets now... if we wait outside, we might be able to meet him.
原來如此！在俱樂部門口蹲他！=I see! Let's stake out the club entrance!
原來如此！在俱樂部門口等他！=I see! Let's stake out the club entrance!
不過，在門口能跟他說上話嗎？\n他是個相當有名的人吧，估計會坐車走？=But can we actually talk to him at the entrance? He's quite famous, right? He'll probably leave by car?
不，如果交給我的話……應該能搞定。=No, if you leave it to me... \nI should be able to manage it.
謝謝你，{{A}}。\n今晚我就去找他談談。=Thank you, {{A}}. I'll go talk to him tonight.
嗯？你一個人嗎？=Hmm? You're going alone?
嗯，當然啦。\n你們昨天也辛苦了，我就一個人……=Yes, of course. You all worked hard yesterday, so I'll just go by myself...
{{A}}？怎麼了？={{A}}? What's wrong?
我們也去！=We're coming too!
別一個人去！=Don't go alone!
沒錯！我們也去！=That's right! We're comin' too!
絕不會讓{{A}}孤軍奮戰的。=We won't let {{A}} fight alone.
對，不好意思哦，這件事可沒商量。\n不管你同不同意，我們都會跟著去！=Yeah, sorry, but this is compulsory, compulsory. Even if you refuse, we'll come with you!
不、不是……你們來幫忙我很開心，\n但想幫{{A}}完全是出自我的個人情感……=N-No... I appreciate the sentiment, but wanting to help {{A}} is purely my personal feeling...
我們是夥伴啊=We're teammates
奪回慾望是我們的工作=<size\=28>Taking back desires is our job</size>
可能會有{{A}}的情報=<size\=26>We might get intel on {{A}}</size>
沒錯，別說這種客氣話了！=That's right, stop bein' so polite!
嗯，奪回{{A}}受害者的慾望，\n也是吾等工作的一部分。=Yes, reclaiming the desires of {{A}}'s victims is also part of our job.
沒錯！如果能恢復{{A}}的慾望……=Exactly! If we can restore {{A}}'s desire...
那不就是{{A}}該做的事嗎！=Then that's exactly what the {{A}} should do!
是的，這可是千載難逢的機會，\n說不定能掌握{{A}}惡行的線索。=Yes, this is a golden opportunity. We might uncover clues about {{A}}'s misdeeds.
這是我們{{A}}的本職工作。=This is our job as the {{A}}.
恢復{{A}}受害者的慾望，\n也是吾等的工作。=Restoring the desires of {{A}}'s victims is also our job.
所以，我們也會一起去的！\n別自己去啦，{{A}}！=So, we're comin' with you too! \nDon't go by yourself, {{A}}!
r:"^昨天，(.*)給我發了個消息。$"="Yesterday, $1 sent me a message."
r:"^昨天，(.*)給我發了訊息。$"="Yesterday, $1 sent me a message."
他說，{{A}}總是想一個人扛下所有，\n得讓我們整個團隊一起承擔才行。=He said that {{A}} always tries to shoulder everything alone, and that we need to share the burden as a whole team.
對工作來說當然是這樣。但更重要的是，\n我們是有共同理想的夥伴，對吧？=For the job, of course that's true. But more importantly, we're teammates with a shared ideal, right?
對啊。所以你別再瞎客氣了，好嗎？=Yeah. So stop with the unnecessary politeness, okay?
對啊。所以你別那麼客氣了，好嗎？=Yeah. So stop with the unnecessary politeness, okay?
一起戰鬥吧=Let's fight together
{{A}}不是一個人=You're not alone, {{A}}
真是的，你們真有意思…… \n每次都被你們的演技給震撼到……=Really, you guys are something... \nI'm always amazed by your performances...
{{A}}，這可不是演技。\n吾等都是真心在為你著想哦。={{A}}, this is no performance. \nWe are all genuinely concerned about you.
……啊，Grazie！=...Ah, Grazie!
謝謝大家。\n那麼今晚，我們全員一起去洞口那吧！=Thank you, everyone. Then tonight, all of us will go see Horaguchi together!

不好意思打擾了，我是演員{{A}}。=Excuse me, I'm the actor {{A}}.
我聽說，洞口征人先生今天會上台演出……=I heard that Yukito Horaguchi-san would be performing on stage today...

{{A}}……？\n啊，那個！我之前看過你的表演！={{A}}...? Ah, that one! \nI've seen your performance before!
真的嗎？我很榮幸，感謝您！=Really? I'm honored, thank you!
其實，我今天剛好在附近忙事情，\n聽說洞口先生在這邊演出……=Actually, I happened to be working nearby today and heard Horaguchi-san was performing here...
就想過來打個招呼。\n不知道他是不是已經走了？=I wanted to come say hello. \nI wonder if he's already left?
啊，他還在呢。\n你後面這些孩子們呢？=Ah, he's still here. \nAnd these kids behind you?
這些是我們劇團剛加入的新人，\n今天一起工作的。=These are rookies who just joined our theater company, we were working together today.
既然來了，我就想讓他們也一起打個招呼。=Since we're here, I thought I'd let them say hello too.
哦……這可是要緊事。\n請稍等，我這就去確認一下。=Oh... This is important. \nPlease wait, I'll go check.
抱歉讓你們久等了。=Sorry to keep you waiting.
洞口先生似乎不太記得{{A}}了……=Horaguchi-san doesn't seem to remember {{A}} very well...
不過打個招呼倒是沒問題。請進。=But it's fine to say hello. Please come in.

洞口 征人=Yukito Horaguchi
哦，你就是{{A}}啊～！\n那個花絮影片爆火的孩子嘛，我知道我知道！=Oh, so you're {{A}}～! The kid from that viral behind-the-scenes video, I know, I know!
不過啊，我們以前沒怎麼接觸過吧？\n為什麼特意來一趟呢？=But, we haven't had much contact before, right? Why did you come?
不好意思，我只是你的粉絲。\n聽說你在{{A}}，所以來打個招呼。=Sorry, I'm just a fan. I heard you were in {{A}}, so I came to say hello.
{{A}}，你真會說話。\n而且啊，那邊的新人小姐們也挺可愛的。={{A}}, you're quite the smooth talker. And hey, those rookie ladies over there are quite cute too.
哦～可以可以。\n不錯哦，你們看起來很有潛力。=Eh～ I see. \nNot bad, you two look promising.
還有時間吧？去吃點好吃的怎麼樣？=Still have time? \nHow about going for some good food?
好吃的！？我們去……=Good food!? Let's go...
抱歉，我們還是未成年，不能待到太晚。=Sorry, we're still minors, we can't stay out too late.
而且今天我們來見洞口先生，\n其實並不是為了打招呼。=And actually, today we came to see Horaguchi-san not just to say hello.
你知道{{A}}嗎？=<size\=26>Do you know {{A}}?</size>
你記得{{A}}嗎？=<size\=23>Do you remember {{A}}?</size>
我們想聊聊關於IDL社長的事=<size\=22>We'd like to talk about the IDL president</size>
Choice 1
{{A}}嗎……？={{A}}...?
當然，我知道她的名字。怎麼了？=Of course, I know her name. What about it?
Choice 2
{{A}}……？啊，應該是個偶像吧。\n不過他不是已經退役了嗎？={{A}}...? Ah, should be an idol, right? But hasn't he retired?
不，並沒有。他只是從IDL公司，\n轉到BEAUTIFUL HIGH去了。=No, he hasn't. He just transferred from IDL to BEAUTIFUL HIGH.
從IDL，\n到BEAUTIFUL HIGH……=From IDL... to BEAUTIFUL HIGH...
……原來如此。\n那，這和我又有什麼關係？=...I see. So, what does that have to do with me?
Choice 3
哈？IDL……？=Huh? IDL...?
應該是個小型娛樂公司吧？怎麼了？=Should be a small entertainment agency, right? What about it?
其實，今天我們來是有事情想問你。=Actually, we came today because we have something to ask you.
洞口先生，你被IDL的社長暴力對待過，\n對吧？=Horaguchi-san, you were assaulted by the IDL president, right?
……那個啊。你是聽誰說的？=...Um. Who did you hear that from?
不過，你已經被{{A}}叮囑過，\n不許把這事說出去。對嗎？=But, you've been instructed by {{A}} not to talk about it, right?
{{A}}，你們到底是什麼人？問這些幹什麼？={{A}}, who exactly are you people? Why are you asking this?
我們並不是來譴責你的。=We're not here to blame you.
只是想告訴你，{{A}}用這件事……=We just want to tell you that {{A}} used this incident...
威脅了當時還在IDL工作的{{A}}。=To threaten {{A}}, who was working at IDL at the time.
並且為了不讓這事曝光，\n她把對方從IDL轉到了自己旗下的事務所。=And to prevent this from coming to light, she transferred him from IDL to her own agency.
都是些風言風語罷了，有什麼證據嗎？=It's all just rumors, got any proof?
都是些流言蜚語罷了，有什麼證據嗎？=It's all just rumors, got any proof?
我們想要你作證，證明這件事的真相。=We want you to testify and tell the truth about this incident.
{{A}}突然跳槽，\n不是背叛了事務所，而是……={{A}}'s sudden transfer wasn't a betrayal of his agency, but...
是因為{{A}}從中作梗！=It was because {{A}} manipulation!
只要你說出實情，{{A}}就有可能……\n回到IDL，再繼續他的偶像生涯了！=If you just tell the truth, {{A}} might be able to... return to IDL and continue his idol career!
不知道！我什麼都不知道！=I don't know! I don't know anything!
{{A}}那傢伙不是已經消失了嘛！？=Didn't that {{A}} guy disappear already!?
我為什麼要為那種人……！=Why should I do anything for someone like that...!
不！他沒消失！=No! He hasn't disappeared!
那個人現如今……\n依然在{{A}}的控制之下，受盡折磨！=That person is still... suffering under {{A}}'s control even now!
你同樣作為歌手，應該明白吧！=You're a singer too, you should understand!
被剝奪了選擇的機會，唯一能做的就是，\n對{{A}}唯命是從……{{B}}的痛苦你懂嗎！=Having his choices taken away, forced to obey {{A}}'s every command... Do you understand {{B}}'s pain?!
哈……\n既然你能明白這些，{{A}}你也應該知道……=Ha... If you can understand all that, {{A}}, you should also know...
在這個圈子裡，\n反抗{{A}}的下場有多麼可怕！=In this industry, the consequences of defying {{A}} are terrifying!
就算我真的在幫{{A}}做事，\n而你們非要我背叛她……=Even if I really am working for {{A}}, and you want me to betray her...
總得先給我點兒回報吧？\n比如……你們的「心意」之類的……=You gotta give me something in return first, right? Like... your "sincerity" or something...
總得先給我一點回報吧？\n比如……你們的「心意」之類的……=You gotta give me something in return first, right? Like... your "sincerity" or something...
是要錢嗎？=You mean money?
「心意」啦，「心意」……="Sincerity," "sincerity"...
要是你把這些姑娘們「介紹」給我的話，\n我倒也不介意哦。=If you "introduce" these girls to me, \nI wouldn't mind either.
等等……=Wait...
你開什麼玩笑？=Are you kidding me?
離她們遠點！=Stay away from them!
我不行嗎？=How about me?
呵。如果換成我們的話，\n隨便怎麼「介紹」都奉陪哦。=Oh. If it's us, we'll accept any "introduction" you make.
……哦，這意思是交易失敗了吧。=...Oh, so the deal's off, huh.
不行！=No!
你們在不行個什麼勁！選擇權在我這裡好吧！=What do you mean "no"! The choice is mine!
算了算了，看來交易失敗了。=Forget it. Looks like the deal's off.
原來如此，我明白了。=I see, I understand.
這樣的話，你也就完蛋了。=In that case, you're finished too.
不妨告訴你吧，\n據說「某個神秘組織」正在展開行動呢。=Let me tell you, a "certain mysterious organization" is said to be taking action.
……為了揭露{{A}}的所有罪行。=...To expose all of {{A}}'s crimes.
某個神秘組織？你是傻了嗎？\n怎麼可能相信那種小孩子的把戲……=A certain mysterious organization? Are you stupid? Why would I believe such a childish story...
那你聽說過「改心」嗎？=Then, have you heard of "Change of Heart"?
等等，難道是說網絡上流傳的那個……=Wait, you mean the one circulating online...
等等，難道是說網路上流傳的那個……=Wait, you mean the one circulating online...
你愛信不信。反正……=Believe it or not. Anyway...
我剛才說的{{A}}的事，\n也是從可靠的消息來源那裡直接聽到的。=The things I said about {{A}} earlier, \nI heard them directly from a reliable source.
我還知道其他事呢。=I know other things too.
你曾經陷入「不正當的男女關係」，\n為了不讓{{A}}把報導刊登出去……=You were involved in an "improper relationship," and to stop {{A}} from publishing the story...
於是她看中的男人的信息，\n偷偷送給她……還有……=You secretly gave her information about men she was interested in... and also...
於是把她看中的男人的情報，\n偷偷送給她……還有……=You secretly gave her information about men she was interested in... and also...
啊、啊……=Ah, ah...
你當初被IDL社長打，\n其實是因為你對新人偶像動手動腳了吧？=When you were hit by the IDL president, it was actually because you made unwanted advances towards a rookie idol, right?
玩弄一番又把人家給拋棄掉，\n所以社長才那麼生氣的。=You played around with her and then dumped her, that's why the president was so angry.
啊、啊，怎麼可能……\n你怎麼會知道……=Ah, ah, impossible... \nHow did you know...
一切我都調查清楚了。\n{{A}}過去做的壞事，還有牽連的人……=I've investigated everything. The bad things {{A}} did in the past, and the people involved...
離真相大白的日子不遠了哦。=The day when all will be exposed to the light of day isn't far off.
洞口先生，如果你想從{{A}}的賊船上下來，\n這就是最後的機會了。=Horaguchi-san, if you're thinking of jumping ship from {{A}}'s little operation, this is your last chance.
就算是你，在面臨是非黑白的選擇時，\n也想站在正義的一邊吧？=Even for you, when faced with a choice between right and wrong, you'd want to stand on the side of justice, right?
你當初想當歌手，\n也肯定是因為想成為某人的「光」吧！？=When you wanted to become a singer, it must have been because you wanted to be someone's "light," right!?
你說的是……\n我在出道時的採訪裡說過的……=You're talking about... \nwhat I said in my debut interview...
嗯，我記得那篇文章。\n也許你早就忘了那份初衷了吧……=Yes, I remember that article. Maybe you've long forgotten that initial aspiration...
但現在還能「重拾初心」。\n所以請告訴我，{{A}}是不是讓你封口了？=But you can still "stay true to yourself." So please tell me, did {{A}} silenced you?
我們會把接下來的對話都錄下來。\n請說吧，洞口先生。=We'll record the rest of the conversation. \nPlease speak, Horaguchi-san.
……沒錯。我在酒桌上跟{{A}}抱怨過，\n被IDL社長打的事。=...That's right. I complained to {{A}} over drinks about being hit by the IDL president.
然後{{A}}說，讓我都錄下來，\n她不會虧待我的……=Then {{A}} said, let her record everything, she wouldn't treat me badly...
她很巧妙地隱藏了我的過錯……\n然後捏造了一些添油加醋的證詞。=She cleverly hid my faults... and fabricated some exaggerated testimony.
最後她告訴我，這件事不能透露出去……\n還給了我錢。=Finally, she told me I couldn't reveal this... and even gave me money.
不然的話，我在IDL對人家做的事……\n還有其他那些玩弄女人的事……=Otherwise, what I did to that person at IDL... and all those other things about playing with women...
都會被報導出來，讓我好好掂量。=...Would be reported, and I should think carefully.
然後，就突然傳出{{A}}……\n要轉到BEAUTIFUL HIGH了。=Then, suddenly, news came out that {{A}}... was transferring to BEAUTIFUL HIGH.
我啊，馬上就意識到，\n她利用了我的那份黑料。=I realized immediately that she had used my dirt.
謝謝你，證據已經足夠了。=Thank you, that's enough evidence.
那、那個……求求你們！\n這件事不要告訴任何人……=U-Um... Please! \nDon't tell anyone about this...
你還想繼續隱瞞下去嗎？=You still want to keep hiding it?
也是……做了那麼過分的事還提要求……\n未免也太貪心了……=Yeah... It's too greedy to ask for that after doing such terrible things...
我曾經也想成為某人的「光」啊……\n但我……不知道從什麼時候開始……=I also wanted to be someone's "light" once... But I... I don't know when I started...
……走吧，大家。=...Let's go, everyone.

太厲害了{{A}}！\n你剛才就像名偵探，把犯人逼入絕境！=That was amazing, {{A}}! You were just like a great detective cornering a criminal!
是吧？哎呀，虛張聲勢還挺成功的嘛！=Right? Haha, the bluff worked pretty well!
其實有賭的成分……\n說實話，我內心挺緊張的。=To be honest, there was an element of gambling... I was actually really nervous inside.
對啊。如果他擺出一副理直氣壯的樣子，\n或者追問有沒有物證的話……=Yes. If he had acted all righteous or pressed us about physical evidence...
我們反而可能會陷入被動。=We might have been the ones put on the defensive.
嗯，如果真到了那種地步，\n我想只能去{{A}}找他的陰影，讓他改心了。=Well, if it had really come to that, I guess the only option would have been to find his Shadow in the {{A}} and change his heart.
不過……比起那種手段，\n我還是希望他在現實世界中正視自己的惡行。=But... compared to that method, I'd much rather have him face his misdeeds in the real world.
……是啊，{{A}}的事不會留下記憶吧。\n能在現實中讓他坦白，真厲害！=...Yeah, things from the {{A}} don't leave memories, right? Getting him to confess in reality is really impressive!
嗯，他完全被{{A}}的氣勢壓倒了。\n有種深不可測的氣場……=Yeah, he was completely overwhelmed by {{A}}. The atmosphere was unfathomable...
那傢伙一下子被逼得完全招架不住，\n徹底失去冷靜了。=That guy was completely caught off guard and lost his composure entirely.
感覺應該要悔改了吧……\n{{A}}，真是精彩的演技！=It feels like he should have a change of heart now... {{A}}, that was brilliant acting!
真不愧是你=As expected from you
真是個金牌演員=<size\=30>What a gold medal actor</size>
Grazie！謝謝！\n有了這份證詞，社長的誤會應該就能解開了。=Grazie! Thank you! With this testimony, the president's misunderstanding should be cleared up.
而且……果然，有你們在真是太好了。\n光靠我，肯定沒法完成剛才的表演。=And... of course, it's really great having you all here. I definitely couldn't have pulled off that performance alone.
{{A}}，知道就好～！\n就像棒球，最重要的也是團隊合作！={{A}}, good that you know it～! Just like in baseball, teamwork is the most important thing!
你為什麼飄起來了……\n而且這和棒球完全沒關係吧……=Why are you talkin' about...? And this has nothin' to do with baseball...
你為什麼得意忘形了……\n而且這和棒球完全沒關係吧……=Why are you talkin' about...? And this has nothin' to do with baseball...
對了，我在想，\n怎麼才能讓事務所的社長知道這件事呢？=By the way, I was thinkin', how should we let the agency president know about this?
嗯……我也不認識IDL的社長……=Hmm... I don't know the IDL president either...
我會問問我爸或者劇團的{{A}}，\n看看能不能找人幫忙。=I'll ask my dad or the {{A}} from the theater company and see if someone can help.
那方面我們就幫不上了……\n拜託你了，{{A}}。=We can't help much with that part... \nWe'll leave it to you, {{A}}.
抱歉，已經這麼晚了。\n夜路很黑，大家回家注意安全。=Sorry, it's already so late. The streets are dark, everyone be careful on your way home.
{{A}}，怎麼突然像個兄長一樣了？={{A}}, why the sudden big brother act?
是想當{{A}}的兄長嗎？=Tryin' to be the big brother of the {{A}}?
{{A}}，都是你們一直在幫忙，\n偶爾也讓身為{{B}}的我表達一下關切嘛。={{A}}, it's because you're always helping me. So let me act like a {{B}} sometimes.
那我先走了，Ciao！=See you later, Ciao!

{{B}}，你在看什麼，{{A}}？=Ara, what are you looking at, {{A}}?
……啊，{{A}}！=...Ah, {{A}}!
哦，難道是你老東家的新MV？=Oh, is that your old agency's new music video?
沒想到那些孩子還有精力出新歌啊。\n自從你不在了，他們就翻不出什麼水花了呢。=I'm surprised those kids still have the energy to release new songs. They haven't been able to make much of a splash since you left.
他們也一直在努力啊……=They've been working hard too...
還對他們有留戀嗎？=Are you still feeling attached to them?
不，沒有……=No, not at all...
真的嗎～？=Really～?
{{A}}……那我們就把那些人給解決掉吧。={{A}}... Then let's just get rid of them.
等一下！？不要這樣，{{A}}！=Wait!? Please don't, {{A}}!
哎呀，你不是說沒有留戀了嗎？\n這種團體直接抹殺掉不就好了嗎？=Ara, didn't you say you have no attachment? Wouldn't it be fine to just erase a group like that?
還是說，你其實想回去呀～？=Or perhaps... you actually want to go back～?
沒有留戀！真的沒有！=No attachment! Really, none!
所以，求求你，放過他們吧……=So, please, let them go...
他們已經和我沒有任何關係了……=They have nothing to do with me anymore...
是啊，和你沒有任何關係了。=Yes, they have nothing to do with you anymore.
你已經無處可去了，\n只有這裡才是你的歸宿。=You have nowhere else to go. \nThis is the only place for you now.
我知道了……\n我只屬於{{A}}……=I understand... \nI belong only to {{A}}...
很好。=Good.
別再看什麼無聊的影片了，\n趕緊去我桌子上拿杯咖啡，快點。=Stop watching such boring videos and go get me a coffee from my desk. Hurry up.
是的，{{A}}……！=Yes, {{A}}...!
哎呀，{{A}}～！辛苦了～！=Ah, {{A}}～! Good work～!
前幾天真不好意思，\n讓{{A}}白跑一趟……=I'm really sorry about the other day, making {{A}} come all the way for nothing...
我這是在幹什麼啊……=What am I even doing...

----------
Chapter 4 Part 3 Day 3
----------
嗯……今天排練得很不錯。明天再見吧。=Mmm... rehearsal went pretty well today. \nSee you all tomorrow.
嗯～{{A}}辛苦了！明天見～=Yep～ Good work today, {{A}}! \nSee you tomorrow～
先說說{{A}}的事吧，\n昨天洞口的那份證詞要怎麼用？=Let's talk about {{A}} first. How should we use Horaguchi's testimony from yesterday?
關於那件事，昨天我已經聯繫了我爸，\n讓他幫我約了IDL的社長。=About that, I already contacted my dad yesterday and asked him to arrange a meeting with the IDL president for me.
等事情敲定了我爸會聯繫我。=Once it's settled, my dad will get back to me.
動作真快呢……！這樣最好不過了。=You moved fast...! That's for the best.
希望社長能解開誤會啊！=I hope the president can clear up the misunderstanding!
那麼，接下來就聊一聊{{A}}吧。=Then, let's talk about {{A}}.
錄音筆修好了=<size\=28>The voice recorder is fixed</size>
那個{{A}}真讓人不舒服=<size\=28>That {{A}} is really unsettling</size>
嗯……那個「魔法錄音筆」又恢復了。=Hoom... that "magic voice recorder" is restored.
確實是這樣。\n不過現在的問題是「魔法錄音筆」。=That's true. But the current problem is the "magic voice recorder."
{{A}}的認知存在也被變成雜誌了，\n看起來那東西的能力還在呢。={{A}}'s cognitive being was turned into a magazine too. It seems that thing still has power.
但如果沒有被錄下什麼危險的對話，\n應該是不會被變成雜誌的吧。=But if we aren't recorded saying anythin' dangerous, we shouldn't be turned into magazines, right?
那只要在她面前說話不就行了嗎？=Then we just need to not speak in front of her, isn't that enough?
那只要在她面前不說話不就行了嗎？=Then we just need to not speak in front of her, isn't that enough?
是沒錯，但……那其實很難做到。=That's correct, but... \nthat's actually very difficult to do.
在戰鬥中不能出聲，\n就等於不能互相溝通或提醒了。=Not being able to speak during battle means we can't communicate or warn each other.
又不能全靠手勢交流，\n那樣的話肯定會亂成一鍋粥的。=We can't rely solely on hand signals either, \nthat would definitely lead to chaos.
……確實有道理。\n沒想到這能力比想像中還麻煩。=...Good point. I didn't expect that ability to be more annoyin' than imagined.
那就像之前那樣，\n從{{A}}那裡搶過來弄壞就好了吧。=Then, like last time, can't we just snatch it from {{A}} and break it?
有了上次的事，她現在肯定更警惕了，\n不會這麼容易成功的。=After what happened last time, she's definitely more alert now. It won't be that easy.
是啊，確實如此。=Yes, that's true.
嗯？啊，這是她對我的認知存在說過的話。=Hmm? Ah, this is something she said to my cognitive being.
應該是指我覺醒{{A}}前，\n搶走她的「魔法錄音筆」的時候吧？=It probably refers to the time before I awakened my {{A}}, when I snatched her "magic voice recorder"?
不過當時真正把它弄壞的人，是隊長吧？=But the one who actually broke it back then was the leader, right?
對了！那時候她撿起錄音筆，\n說什麼「開不了了」之類的。=Right! Back then, she picked up the voice recorder and said something like "It won't turn on."
而且還告訴{{A}}說那錄音筆要送修，對吧？=And she told {{A}} that the voice recorder needed to be sent for repair, right?
我還以為他會說「趕快買個新的」之類，\n有點意外呢。=I thought she'd say somethin' like "Hurry up and buy a new one," I was a bit surprised.
我還以為她會說「趕快買個新的」之類，\n有點意外呢。=I thought she'd say somethin' like "Hurry up and buy a new one," I was a bit surprised.
嗯，沒錯……我記得她說，\n那是一直在用的「重要的東西」。=Yes, that's right... I think she said it was a "precious item" that she had been using for a long time.
所以說，那個魔法錄音筆，\n不僅僅是籠統的「錄音筆」的象徵……=So, that magic voice recorder isn't just a general symbol of a "voice recorder"...
它和現實中的錄音筆有連接=<size\=22>It's connected to the real voice recorder</size>
它和現實中的錄音筆緊密相連=<size\=30>It's linked to the real voice recorder</size>
是啊，當現實世界的錄音筆被破壞，\n{{A}}的「魔法錄音筆」也又一次壞掉了……=Right. When the real voice recorder was destroyed, the {{A}}'s "magic voice recorder" broke again...
原來如此……！所以恢復需要時間！=I see...! So it takes time to restore!
在{{A}}中破壞錄音筆，\n並不會影響現實中的錄音筆……=Destroying the voice recorder in {{A}} doesn't affect the real voice recorder...
但如果現實中的錄音筆壞了，\n{{A}}裡的就會有所變化……那就對了。=But if the real voice recorder is broken, the one in {{A}} changes accordingly... That makes sense.
意思是，我們可以在現實中，\n再把那個錄音筆弄壞一次。=You mean, we can break that voice recorder again in the real world.
這樣一來{{A}}也……\n不能再用「魔法錄音筆」了吧？=Then {{A}} also... shouldn't be able to use the "magic voice recorder" anymore, right?
嗯，真是個好主意。\n只要在現實中破壞掉，魔法棒的能力也就……=Hoom, that's a good idea. As long as we destroy it in reality, the magic wand's ability should also...
……不對，等一下。吾等怎麼去弄壞它呢？=...No, wait a minute. \nHow are we going to break it?
啊？\n就從她手裡搶過來，然後「啪」地一聲……=Huh? Just snatch it from her and go smash...
那是犯罪啊！會被抓的！=That's a crime! We'd get arrested!
損壞他人財物，肯定會被當場逮捕……\n而且對象是{{A}}，她肯定會報案的……=Vandalism would definitely lead to an arrest on the spot... and since it's {{A}}, she'd surely report it...
那要是讓{{A}}去做的話，\n就不算犯罪了吧？=But if {{A}} does it, it wouldn't count as a crime, right?
啊！？讓吾去！？=Hoo!? Have me do it!?
啊……是不是就像烏鴉或者老鷹搶食那樣？=Ah... like a crow or an eagle snatchin' food?
也許有點極端，但差不多就是那個意思。=Maybe a bit extreme, but that's the idea.
確實！如果那樣的話，\n就能假裝是動物的偶然行為，不算犯罪！=Exactly! If it's like that, we can pretend it's an accidental animal act, not a crime!
不不不，別說這種摸不著頭腦的話啊{{A}}！\n我還以為你是最理智的呢！=No no no, don't say such unrealistic things, {{A}}! I thought you were the most sensible one!
拜託了，{{A}}=Please, {{A}}
只有{{A}}能做到=Only {{A}} can do it
加油，{{A}}大將！=<size\=26>Do your best, General {{A}}!</size>
夠了！誰是{{A}}大將啊！！=Enough! Who is General {{A}}!!
加油，貓頭鷹大將！=Do your best, General Owl!
這不是物種的問題！！=This is not a matter of species!!
唔……現在確實沒有別的辦法了……\n不過，吾等從哪兒下手呢？=Hoom... There really isn't another way... But where should we do it?
唔……現在確實沒有別的辦法了……\n不過，吾等從哪裡下手呢？=Hoom... There really isn't another way... But where should we do it?
在{{A}}內部動手是最保險的辦法……=Doing it inside {{A}}'s office would be the safest...
但是要是公司裡有隻貓頭鷹飛來飛去，\n那肯定會引起騷動的……=But if an owl is flying around inside the company, it would definitely cause a commotion...
要是{{A}}變成麻雀或者鴿子之類的就好了，\n至少不會那麼引人注目。=If only {{A}} could turn into a sparrow or a pigeon, it would be less conspicuous at least.
啊！你不能像在{{A}}變車一樣，\n變成麻雀或者鴿子嗎？=Ah! Can't you transform into a sparrow or pigeon, like how you transform into a car in {{A}}?
怎麼可能！\n而且麻雀和鴿子在公司裡也會很顯眼！=Impossible! And sparrows or pigeons would still be very noticeable in a company!
就算我們在公司門口蹲著，\n也不一定能等到她拿出錄音筆吧。=Even if we stake out the company entrance, there's no guarantee we'll catch her taking out the voice recorder.
……不，等一下。\n有了，我知道{{A}}一定會現身的地方了……=...No, wait. I've got it. I know a place where {{A}} will definitely appear...
{{A}}哪兒啊！？={{A}} Where!?
{{A}}哪裡啊！？={{A}} Where!?
你看，之前不是說過嗎。=Look, didn't she say this?
也就是說，\n{{A}}會在「學園祭當天」來{{B}}……=That is to say, {{A}} will come to {{B}} on "the day of the school festival"...
而且因為她打算錄下{{A}}的承諾，\n所以一定會帶錄音筆來！=And since she plans to record {{A}}'s promise, she'll definitely bring the voice recorder!
原來如此……不愧是{{A}}！=I see... As expected from {{A}}!
不過反過來說，這也意味著在學園祭之前，\n我們是沒辦法動手的。=But conversely, this also means we can't make a move before the school festival.
啊，對啊！\n唔……這樣想有點不舒服呢……=Ah, right! Ugh... Thinking about it that way is a bit uncomfortable...
是啊。不過，在學園祭前想其他辦法來執行，\n好像也不太現實。=Yes. But trying to execute it another way before the festival doesn't seem very realistic either.
要讓{{A}}成功搶走錄音筆，\n沒練習過也不太可能成功吧。=For {{A}} to successfully snatch the voice recorder, it probably won't work without some practice.
哦，是我手機，抱歉。=Oh, it's my phone, sorry.
是我爸，說明天放學後，\n給我安排了和IDL的社長見面。=It's my dad. He says he arranged a meeting with the IDL president for me tomorrow after school.
這次肯定不能大家一起去，\n只能我一個人去。=This time, I really can't have everyone come along, I have to go alone.
{{A}}，但……={{A}}, but...
放心吧，這次我可不是在自己一個人硬扛。\n是因為考慮到社長那邊的情況。=Don't worry, this time I'm not trying to handle it all by myself. It's out of consideration for the president's situation.
是啊，要是我們一群學生去了，\n對方肯定會很為難……=Yes, if a group of students shows up, \nthe other party would definitely be troubled...
嗯，讓學生們知道了那麼多娛樂圈的內幕，\n他也會覺得坐立不安吧。=Right, knowing that students have learned so much about the industry's inside story would make him uneasy too.
那好。我和社長聊完之後，\n我們要不要在{{A}}碰面？=Alright then. After I finish talking with the president, should we meet up in {{A}}?
應該正好趕上你們排練結束吧。=It should be right around when your rehearsal ends.
行，太好了！\n我也想趕緊知道結果呢。=Oh, great! I wanna hear the results quickly too.
那就定了，明天下午放學後在{{A}}集合，\n今天就到此為止吧。=Then it's settled. We'll meet in {{A}} tomorrow after school. Let's call it a day for now.

Chapter 4 Part 3 Day 4
----------
那麼……如何？\n和IDL的社長談得怎麼樣？=So... how did it go? \nHow was the talk with the IDL president?
嗯，已經讓他聽過錄音了。=Right, I already let him listen to the recording.
IDL社長=IDL President
竟然……那意思是……！\n{{A}}是為了保護我嗎……？=To think... that means...! \n{{A}} was trying to protect me...?
真是個笨蛋……笨蛋傢伙。\n就不能跟我直說嗎……=What an idiot... that idiot. \nCouldn't he just tell me directly...?
為了保護事務所，一個人背負了污名……\n以為我會為此感到高興嗎……=Thinking he'd make me happy by bearing the disgrace alone to protect the agency...
為了保護事務所，一個人背負了汙名……\n以為我會為此感到高興嗎……=Thinking he'd make me happy by bearing the disgrace alone to protect the agency...
正因為沒有那樣想過……\n所以才會撒謊然後默默離開吧……=Because he didn't think so... \nthat's why he lied to you and left...
那麼，{{A}}的事情……=So, about {{A}}'s situation...
雖然現在就想立刻把他帶回來，\n但確實有點難……=Although I want to bring him back right now, it is a bit difficult...
得罪了「BEAUTIFUL HIGH」，\n那就等於得罪了{{A}}的{{B}}……=Offending "BEAUTIFUL HIGH" means offending {{A}}'s {{B}}...
是啊……\n如果因為這個讓事務所出事……=Yeah... If something happens to the agency because of this...
{{A}}可能會把自己逼得更緊……={{A}} might put even more pressure on himself...
嗯。不過，如果他自己說想要回來的話……=Ah. But, if he himself says he wants to come back...
我一定會接受他的。\n為此我會盡一切努力。=I will definitely accept him. \nI'll do everything I can for that.
我也會和其他成員說這件事，\n他們也一定會幫忙的。=I'll also talk to the other members about this, they'll definitely help too.
果然不能馬上回到原來的事務所呢……=So he can't return to his old agency immediately after all...
這也可以說明，\n{{A}}在娛樂圈的影響力有多大吧。=This also shows just how much influence {{A}} has in the industry, right?
只要讓{{A}}改心就行了=<size\=20>We just need to change {{A}}'s heart</size>
讓{{A}}改心後再回去就好了=<size\=22>He can return after we change {{A}}'s heart</size>
是啊。如果{{A}}能改心，\n她就不會想著搞垮IDL了。=Yeah. If {{A}} has a change of heart, \nshe won't try to ruin IDL.
而且，如果她在記者會上坦白犯下的錯……\n娛樂圈裡的其他人也就不怕她了。=Moreover, if she confesses her wrongdoings at a press conference... others in the industry won't fear her anymore.
這樣{{A}}就能回到IDL了，\n誰也不會妨礙他。=Then {{A}} can return to IDL, \nand no one will stand in his way.
記者會……是啊。她也像{{A}}和{{B}}那樣，\n把所有壞事都抖出來就好了。=A press conference... Yeah. It'd be great if she spilled all the bad things, like {{A}} and {{B}} did.
嗯。不過，{{A}}倒台之後要去哪裡，\n得由{{B}}自己決定。=Hoom. But where {{B}} goes after {{A}}'s downfall should be his own decision.
嗯。不過，{{A}}倒臺之後要去哪裡，\n得由{{B}}自己決定。=Hoom. But where {{B}} goes after {{A}}'s downfall should be his own decision.
這就交給他本人的慾望和意志吧，\n我們專心攻略{{A}}就好了。=Let's leave that to his own desires and will. \nWe should focus on {{A}} infiltration.
沒錯！不過……去{{A}}之前呢～=That's right! But... before going to the {{A}}～
我們得趕緊特訓一下{{A}}吧！=We need to start the special training for {{A}}!
啊？特訓……？=Hoo? Special training...?
對，學園祭的時候{{A}}一出現，\n拿出錄音筆的瞬間……=Yes! When {{A}} appears at the school festival, the moment she takes out the voice recorder...
你就嗖地飛下來！咔嚓一下啄壞錄音筆！\n差不多這個意思，對吧？=You swoop down! Peck the recorder pen and break it! Something like that, right?
你就嗖地飛下來！咖嚓一下啄壞錄音筆！\n差不多這個意思，對吧？=You swoop down! Peck the recorder pen and break it! Something like that, right?
那現在就得開始特訓吧！=Then we should start training now!
{{A}}……我明白你想說什麼，但……=Uh... I understand what you're saying, but...
好嘞，那去外面練吧！\n找找能代替錄音筆的，棍子之類的！=Alright, let's go practice outside! Find something like a stick to substitute for the voice recorder!
好的，那去外面練吧！\n找找能代替錄音筆的，棍子之類的！=Alright, let's go practice outside! Find something like a stick to substitute for the voice recorder!
好，那去外面練吧！\n找找能代替錄音筆的，棍子之類的！=Alright, let's go practice outside! Find something like a stick to substitute for the voice recorder!
等等。在{{A}}訓練貓頭鷹的話，\n也太顯眼了，會讓人起疑。=Wait. Training an owl in {{A}} would be too conspicuous and raise suspicions.
得找個不那麼引人注意的地方……\n學校屋頂或者沒人的體育館之類。=We need a place that's less noticeable... \nlike the school roof or an empty gym.
確實！=True!
而且，要認真練習的話，\n是不是還需要舞臺用的小道具啊？=And if we're going to practice seriously, \nwouldn't we need some small props too?
還有扮演{{A}}的人……\n最好找個能演好中年女性的演員。=And someone to play {{A}}... preferably an actor who can play a middle-aged woman well.
這也確實！=Also true!
{{A}}，該你上場啦！={{A}}, you're up!
還真有適合演老媽的人呢=<size\=25>There's someone suited for the role</size>
哎呀討厭啦！\n輪到人家上場啦！？=Oh dear! \nIs it my time to shine!?
噗哈！{{A}}！\n別這樣，別突然來這一出啊！=Pfft! {{A}}! Stop it, don't pull that all of a sudden!
噗哈！{{A}}！\n別這樣，別突然來這一齣啊！=Pfft! {{A}}! Stop it, don't pull that all of a sudden!
{{A}}，成長了啊……！={{A}}, you've grown...!
{{A}}。其實真不想在這種事上成長啊……！={{A}}. I really didn't want to grow in this area...!
{{A}}完全和{{B}}打成一片了……={{A}} really feels like a part of the {{B}} now...
這樣的氛圍令人十分舒適……=This kind of atmosphere is very comfortable...
但，為什麼呢……=But, why...
總感覺……\n想起了一些不屬於這裡的事……=I feel like... I'm remembering something that doesn't belong here...
{{A}}已經……\n只剩下我們3個人了呢……=The {{A}}... \nit's already down to just the three of us...
剛剛那是……？=What was that just now...?
好了，雖然聊得很開心，\n但今天差不多該收尾了。=Alright, although it was fun chatting, \nwe should wrap things up for today.
現在回學校去特訓就太晚了，\n等明天排練完舞臺劇吧。=It's too late to go back to school for special training now. Let's do it after tomorrow's rehearsal.
是啊～聊了這麼多，天都快黑了。=Yeah～ We've talked so much, it's almost dark.
那{{A}}，今晚記得腦內訓練哦！腦內訓練！=Then {{A}}, remember to do mental training tonight! Mental training!
腦、腦內訓練嗎……\n好吧，知道了。=M-Mental training...? \nOkay, understood.
怎麼了，隊長？你看起來有點心不在焉的。=What's wrong, Leader? \nYou seem a bit distracted.
啊……沒事=Ah... nothing
哦？沒事就好……=Oh? That's fine then...
r:"^……我懂的，(.*)。$"="...I get it, $1."
最近淨吃漢堡了……！\n肯定是想念拉麵了吧！？=You've been eatin' nothin' but hamburgers lately...! You must be missin' ramen, right!?
最近都只吃漢堡……！\n肯定是想念拉麵了吧！？=You've been eatin' nothin' but hamburgers lately...! You must be missin' ramen, right!?
不不不，他又不是你……=No no no, he's not like you...
不過，我贊成回去路上吃碗拉麵！=But, I agree with stopping for ramen on the way home!
啊！？待會兒還要再吃一頓！？=Ah!? We're eating another meal!?
啊！？等等還要再吃一頓！？=Ah!? We're eating another meal!?
剛才見到的「幻象」，\n真讓人在意……=That "vision" I saw earlier is really bothering me...
但又不想破壞這歡樂的氛圍……=But I don't want to ruin this happy atmosphere...
所以，還是別跟大家說了吧……=So, I probably shouldn't tell everyone about it...
之後又聊了聊舞臺準備之類的事，\n就和大家分開了……=After talking a bit more about stage preparations, I parted ways with everyone...

----------
Chapter 4 Part 3 Day 5
----------
「{{A}}……{{B}}。若想面見老大，\n就先打倒我這個黑之戰鬥員吧！」="{{A}}... {{B}}. If you wish to meet the boss, you must first defeat me, the Combatant in Black!"
「求之不得！」="Gladly!"
……看來大家已經排得相當熟練啦。\n好期待正式演出啊。=...It seems everyone has rehearsed quite thoroughly. I'm really looking forward to the actual performance.
開始緊張起來了……=<size\=26>I'm starting to get nervous...</size>
到時候會來看嗎？=<size\=29>Will you come to watch?</size>
加油哦。\n我會在觀眾席為你們喝彩的。=Do your best. I'll be cheering for you from the audience.
現在還早呢！=It's still early for that!
r:"^我覺得肯定沒問題。\n(.*)的演技也超棒……$"="I'm sure it will be fine. Your acting is also amazing..."
到時候，\n我會在觀眾席上好好欣賞的。=I'll be sure to enjoy it properly from the audience.
那當然啦。\n我會在觀眾席為你們加油的。=Of course. I'll be cheering for you from the audience.
而且，我對{{A}}的學園祭也很感興趣呢……=Also, I'm quite interested in {{A}}'s school festival too...
順便問一下……{{A}}那邊怎麼樣了？=By the way... how are things with {{A}}?
進展順利=It's going well
不太順利……=Not going so well...
Choice 1
這樣啊，那太好了……=I see, that's good then...
加油哦。\n要是還有我能幫忙的地方，儘管跟我說。=Do your best. If there's anything else I can help with, please let me know.
Choice 2
要是還有我能幫忙的地方，別客氣儘管說。=If there's anything else I can help with, \nplease don't hesitate to ask.
r:"^說起來，有件事想跟(.*)商量。$"="Speaking of which, there's something I'd like to discuss with you."
這段時間，\n我手機上出現了一個沒見過的圖示……=Lately, an icon I've never seen before appeared on my smart phone...
{{A}}，就是這個像蛇一樣的。=Uh, the one that looks like a snake.
怎麼刪都刪不掉，\n在網上也查不出個所以然……=I can't delete it no matter what, and I can't find any information about it online either...
我非常擔心，這該不會是什麼病毒吧……=I'm really worried, could this be some kind of virus...?
……你真的一點頭緒都沒有嗎？=...You really have no idea at all?
嗯，完全不明白……=Yes, I completely don't understand...
……看起來她是真不知道啊。\n這樣的話，還是跟她說明白比較好。=...It seems she genuinely doesn't know. \nIn that case, it's better to explain it to her.
要是不小心點到，稀里糊塗闖進了{{A}}，\n那可就危險了。=If she accidentally taps it and gets pulled into {{A}} unknowingly, it would be dangerous.
要是不小心點到，稀裡糊塗闖進了{{A}}，\n那可就危險了。=If she accidentally taps it and gets pulled into {{A}} unknowingly, it would be dangerous.
沒錯。要是我們也在旁邊，\n很有可能被一起捲進去……=Right. If we happened to be nearby, \nwe could easily get dragged in too...
為了防止再出現之前那種情況，\n我覺得還是現在就說清楚比較好。=To prevent a situation like last time from happening again, I think it's better to explain things clearly now.
那個……{{A}}？=Um... {{A}}?
你為什麼一直對著貓頭鷹說話呀？=Why are you talking to owl-san?
……{{A}}，你能聽到吾的聲音吧？=...{{A}}, you can hear my voice, can't you?
{{B}}……你能聽到{{A}}的聲音嗎？={{B}}... can you hear {{A}}'s voice?
聲音？\n啊……能聽到它在叫……=Voice? \nAh... I can hear it calling...
這怎麼回事……\n這傢伙，明明有{{A}}……=What's going on... \nEven though she has the {{A}}...
卻聽不懂吾說話嗎？=She can't understand what I'm saying?
不是說具備「慾望素養」的人，\n就能聽懂你說話嗎？=I thought people with the "potential for desire" could understand you?
嗯……應該是啊。=Hmm... that should be the case.
而且能被賦予{{A}}的，\n肯定也是有著「慾望素養」的人……=And those who can be granted the {{A}} definitely have the "potential for desire"...
可{{A}}卻聽不懂……？=But {{A}} can't understand...?
這怎麼回事啊？\n和我們那時候有什麼不一樣嗎？=What's goin' on? How is it different from our situation back then?
那個……？=Um...?
喂～{{A}}～！=Hey～ {{A}}～!
下一個！該{{A}}和{{B}}上場了吧？\n{{B}}都等得不耐煩了！=Next! Isn't it {{A}} and {{B}}'s turn? {{B}} is getting impatient!
{{A}}……這也是命運的安排吧……={{A}}... This is also fate's arrangement, \nI suppose...
不好意思！我這就來！=Sorry! I'm comin'!
啊，抱歉。怎麼說呢……=Ah, sorry. How to put it...
等排練完，其他人都走了之後，\n我們再好好聊。=After rehearsal ends and everyone else has left, we'll talk properly.
那個圖示，還有剛剛提到的貓頭鷹，\n都會跟你解釋清楚的。=We'll explain clearly about that icon, \nand the owl we just mentioned.
貓頭鷹……\n這到底是怎麼回事？=Owl... Just what is going on?
告訴你{{A}}的秘密=<size\=30>We'll tell you our secret</size>
和{{A}}有關的事=<size\=24>It's about the {{A}}</size>
……我明白了。\n那就拜託各位了。=...I understand. \nThen I'll leave it to you all.

啊？按這個圖示……就能去{{A}}？=Huh? Clicking this icon... \ncan take me to the {{A}}?
然後……這個應用程序，\n會自動安裝在一些特定的人的手機上……=And... this app automatically installs itself on the phones of specific people...
然後……這個應用程式，\n會自動安裝在一些特定的人的手機上……=And... this app automatically installs itself on the phones of specific people...
然後這些人還能聽懂貓頭鷹先生的聲音……\n是這樣嗎？=And those people can understand what owl-san is saying... Is that right?
嗯，就是這樣。=Yes, that's right.
準確來說，是「有慾望素養的人」。\n不過，這說法實在有點寬泛……=To be precise, it's "people with the potential for desire." But that term is a bit vague...
應該是指能直面自己真實慾望的人吧。\n換句話說，是有資格使用{{A}}的人。=It refers to people who can face their true desires. In other words, those qualified to use a {{A}}.
……我只聽見它在「咕咕咕」地叫。=...I only hear it going "Hoot hoot hoot."
大家都能聽懂貓頭鷹先生在說什麼嗎？=Can everyone understand what owl-san is saying?
只要具備慾望素養……=<size\=20>As long as you have the potential for desire...</size>
你真的聽不懂嗎？=<size\=25>Do you really not understand?</size>
它說「咕咕咕」=It says "Hoot hoot hoot"
慾望的素養……？我不太明白……=Potential for desire...? I don't really get it...
是的。我只能聽到它在咕咕叫……=Yes. I can only hear it hooting...
{{A}}，這個我懂……\n但其實並不是我聽到的這樣吧？=Um, I get that... but that's not really what it's saying, right?
嗯。對我們來說，\n{{A}}就像正常人一樣在說話。=Yes. To us, {{A}} speaks just like a normal person.
不是我懷疑大家啊……\n但你們沒跟我開玩笑吧？=Not that I doubt you all... but you're not pulling a prank on me, are you?
當然沒有啊。\n誰會拿這種事來開玩笑啊。=Of course not. Who would joke about somethin' like this?
那……我先按一下這個圖示……=Then... I'll try clicking this icon first...
哇——等等等等等等！！=Whoa- Wait wait wait!!
怎、怎麼啦？=Wh-What's wrong?
在這裡不行！\n必須得在{{A}}按才行！=Not here! You have to click it in {{A}}!
{{A}}……？為什麼？={{A}}...? Why?
{{C}}，因為{{B}}的入口！\n除了在{{A}}都很危險！=Um, because that's the entrance to {{B}}! It's dangerous anywhere but {{A}}!
在{{A}}就安全嗎？為什麼呢？=It's safe in {{A}}? Why?
{{A}}……總之在這裡就是不行啦！=Um... Just not here!
現在就去{{A}}=<size\=29>Let's go to {{A}} now</size>
先把手機沒收=<size\=28>Let's confiscate the phone</size>
啊？這是要把{{A}}帶到{{B}}裡去？！=Huh? You're taking {{A}} to {{B}}?!
嗯……與其在這兒問來問去，\n不如讓她親眼看看，這樣解釋起來更容易。=Hmm... Rather than asking questions back and forth here, it's easier to explain if she sees it with her own eyes.
嗯……與其在這裡問來問去，\n不如讓她親眼看看，這樣解釋起來更容易。=Hmm... Rather than asking questions back and forth here, it's easier to explain if she sees it with her own eyes.
明白！=Understood!
等、等一下，{{A}}……！=W-Wait, {{A}}...!
大家冷靜點。\n再這樣追問下去也沒有任何意義。=Everyone, calm down. Pressing her like this won't lead anywhere.
不如直接去{{B}}，\n讓{{A}}親眼看看{{C}}。=Let's go to {{B}} and let {{A}} see {{C}} for herself.
不過只走到入口，不進去探索，\n看完就馬上回來。=But we'll only go to the entrance, not explore, and come back right after seeing it.
嗯……那樣的話應該能規避不少危險。\n那，我們這就出發去{{A}}吧。=Hoom... That should avoid most dangers. Then, let's head to {{A}} now.
貓頭鷹又在咕咕叫……=The owl is hooting again...

就從這兒！這兒就能去{{A}}啦！=Right here! You can go to the {{A}} from here!
就從這裡！這裡就能去{{A}}啦！=Right here! You can go to the {{A}} from here!
啊……？這裡嗎……？=Ah...? Here...?
這地方人來人往的……\n真的沒問題嗎？=This place is so crowded... \nIs it really okay?
要是真去{{A}}了，在別人眼裡，\n我們不就像突然消失了一樣嘛……對吧？=If we really go to the {{A}}, to others, wouldn't it look like we suddenly disappeared... right?
……好像是哦！？=...That's true!?
不過，{{A}}肯定有什麼神奇的力量，\n能解決這個問題吧？=But, the {{A}} must have some magical power to handle this, right?
不，{{A}}沒這種能力。=No, the {{A}} doesn't have that ability.
對。不過你想想，\n本來這個世界就處於「慾望枯竭的狀態」。=Yes. But think about it, this world is already in a "state of fading desire."
慾望淡薄的人，\n幾乎不關心其他陌生人……=People with weak desires hardly pay attention to strangers...
加上{{A}}的影響，都「無可奈何」地認命了，\n連周遭的景象都逐漸變得虛無了吧。=Plus, with the {{A}}'s influence, they've resigned themselves. Even the surroundings are becoming hollow.
如果是非常有名的人，情況可能會不同……\n但就算是{{A}}，走在街上也沒人跟他搭話吧？=If you were a celebrity, things might be different... But the truth is, just like {{A}}, you're not going to get approached much.
嗯……確實。雖然在學校裡會被包圍，\n但走在大街上基本沒人會注意到我。=Well... True. Although I get surrounded at school, basically no one notices me on the street.
所以，現在我們就算突然消失，\n也沒人會注意到……就是這個原理吧。=So, the principle is that even if we disappear suddenly now, no one would notice...
要是鬧出很大動靜，可能會被發現，\n但只是安靜地消失應該沒問題。=If we make a big commotion, we might be discovered, but if we disappear quietly, it should be fine.
原、原來是這樣……\n不過，這世界也太糟糕了吧……=I-I see...? \nBut this world is too terrible...
放心。我們讓{{A}}改心之後，\n找回慾望的人會越來越多。=Don't worry. After we make the {{A}}s have a change of heart, more and more people will regain their desires.
就像之前說的，隨著{{A}}的開拓，\n被壓抑在深處的慾望也會得到釋放。=Like I said before, as we go deeper into {{A}}, the repressed desires will also be released.
再加上現在{{B}}的知名度也在提高，\n{{A}}的數量也在逐漸變少。=Plus, the {{B}} are now more widely known, and the number of {{A}}s is gradually decreasing.
這都是怪盜活動的成果=<size\=30>That's the result of our work</size>
嗯。所以現在去{{A}}的時候要更小心才行。=Hoom. We need to be more careful when going to the {{A}} now.
你想說，人們有了慾望固然是好事，\n但我們消失時別人也「能看見了」……對吧。=You mean, it's good that people have desires, but others "can see" when we disappear now... right?
沒錯。而且啊，{{A}}的人數也越來越多了。=Exactly. And also, the {{A}}' numbers are growing.
這麼多人一起消失，\n被人發現的可能性肯定也變高了。=With so many people disappearing together, the chance of being discovered definitely increases.
這麼說的話……以後進{{A}}的時候，\n得提前留意周圍的情況了。=If that's the case... when entering {{A}} from now on, we need to pay attention to our surroundings in advance.
嗯。不過也別過於拘謹，不然反倒可疑。\n對他人的事不感興趣本就是人的「天性」。=That being said, being too cautious will only make you suspicious, and it's "human nature" to not be interested in other people.
從今往後要多注意周圍的情況……\n稍微這樣留個心眼就行了。=From now on, just be a bit more mindful of the surroundings... that's enough.
……難道說，\n現在貓頭鷹先生在給大家講解什麼嗎？=...Could it be that owl-san is explaining something to everyone right now?
啊，對哦！{{A}}……=Ah, right! Umm...
原來如此……你這麼一說，\n我發現自己好像也很少去留意別人的舉動。=I see... Now that you mention it, I realize I also rarely pay attention to others' actions.
是因為慾望變少了嗎……？\n我倒是沒怎麼意識到……=Is it because my desires have decreased...? \nI haven't really noticed...
啊，不好意思。\n聽了剛才的話，我突然有些事比較在意……=Ah, sorry. After hearing what was just said, something suddenly occurred to me...
什麼都可以跟我們說=<size\=30>You can tell us anything</size>
我要說的可能聽起來有點奇怪……=What I'm about to say might sound a bit strange...
剛才{{A}}說過，我們讓{{B}}改心，\n讓一些人找回了慾望對吧。={{A}} said earlier that we make {{B}}s have a change of heart and help people regain their desires, right.
沒錯！{{A}}最近也完全恢復精神了呢！=That's right! \n{{A}} has been full of energy lately too!
但另一方面……\n那些對{{A}}騷亂「樂在其中」的人會怎麼樣呢？=But on the other hand... what about those who "enjoy" the {{A}} disturbances?
{{A}}這麼受歡迎，就意味著……=The fact that {{A}} is so popular means...
看那些影片的人也產生了某種慾望。=The people watching those videos are also creating some kind of desire.
所以我就想，從某種角度來說，\n我們的行動是不是在剝奪這些人的慾望呢……=So I was thinking, from a certain perspective, are our actions taking away these people's desires...?
可、可是，怎麼說呢……\n那些是「負面慾望」之類的東西吧？=B-But, how should I put it... those are "negative desires" or something like that, right?
看看那些在{{A}}上搞破壞的傢伙，\n以別人的不幸為樂……這愛好也太惡俗了。=Look at those guys causin' trouble on {{A}}, enjoyin' others' misfortune... that's such a vulgar hobby.
這跟{{A}}那種人的慾望，\n不就是同一類東西嘛。=Isn't that the same kind of desire people like {{A}} has?
也許是吧。\n但不管怎麼說，慾望就是慾望。=Maybe so. But no matter what, desire is desire.
而且看到{{A}}就義憤填膺，從某種意義上說，\n也是一種正義的……正面的慾望，對吧。=And feeling indignant when seeing {{A}}s is, in a sense, a kind of righteous... positive desire, right?
這麼看的話，說不定……\n是「負面慾望」催生了「正面慾望」呢。=Looking at it this way, perhaps... "negative desires" give rise to "positive desires."
{{A}}……？\n這到底是什麼意思啊？={{A}}...? \nWhat does that actually mean?
……我大概明白了。=...I think I understand roughly.
正義戰勝邪惡，邪惡被消滅，\n迎來大團圓結局，這是故事裡常見的套路……=Good triumphs over evil, evil is destroyed, leading to a happy ending, that's a common trope in stories...
但要是真的把所有邪惡都消滅了，\n你們覺得會怎麼樣呢？=But if we really eliminate all evil, \nwhat do you think would happen?
會變成理想的世界？=<size\=27>It becomes an ideal world?</size>
想像不出來……=I can't imagine...
我不知道。但至少……=I don't know. But at least...
我也一樣。但至少……=Me too. But at least...
我覺得世界上也不會存在正義了。\n畢竟，正義和邪惡是一體兩面的。=I feel like justice wouldn't exist in the world either. After all, justice and evil are two sides of the same coin.
把邪惡都驅逐了，\n「正義」這個概念本身也就不存在了。=By eradicating evil, the very concept of "justice" would cease to exist.
……也就是說，\n如果我們把「負面慾望」都剝奪了……=...So, you mean, if we take away all "negative desires"...
「正面慾望」也會消失……對吧？="Positive desires" would also disappear... right?
不，那種事情……=No, that can't be...
{{A}}……我腦袋都亂套啦！={{A}}... \nMy head's all messed up!
r:"^那個，(.*)。\n我們做的是正確的事，對吧？$"="Hey, $1. What we're doing is the right thing, right?"
應該是吧=It should be
我希望是那樣=I hope so
我不知道……=I don't know...
……是啊。為了幫助那些受苦的人，\n我們讓{{A}}改心……=...Yes. To help those who are suffering, we make {{A}}s have a change of heart...
我覺得這個行為本身並沒有錯。=I think the act itself isn't wrong.
不好意思……我不該說這些多餘的話。\n我們先把這事情忘了吧。=Sorry... I shouldn't have said these unnecessary things. Let's forget about it for now.
至少，我覺得讓{{A}}改心這件事沒錯。=At the very least, I don't think making {{A}}s have a change of heart is wrong.
也是。這種費腦筋的事情下次再想，\n現在先去{{A}}吧。=Right, let's leave the difficult thinkin' for now and head to {{A}}.
也是。這種傷腦筋的事情下次再想，\n現在先去{{A}}吧。=Right, let's leave the difficult thinkin' for now and head to {{A}}.
嗯，走吧。=Yes, let's go.
啟動{{A}}=Start the {{A}}
讓{{A}}啟動吧=Let {{A}} start it
真的要……去{{A}}……？=We're really going... to the {{A}}...?
啊，{{A}}……好的！\n按這個圖示就可以對吧……！=Ah, uh... okay! Just click this icon, right...?!
好，我按啦……！=Alright, I'm clicking it...!

Aran Into Metaverse

呀啊！？誰！？=Ah!? Who!?
冷靜點，是我們啊。=Calm down, it's us.
我們在{{A}}就是這副模樣。=This is what we look like in the {{A}}.
啊……是、是這樣啊……=Ah... \nI-Is that so...?
也對，那麼一瞬間就換了衣服……\n一般來說，這、這根本不可能嘛……=Right, changing clothes in an instant... Normally, th-that would be impossible...
沒錯，我第一次看到的時候也嚇傻了。\n我太能理解{{A}}你現在的心情了。=Yes, I was stunned too when I first saw it. \nI understand how you feel right now, {{A}}.
怎麼樣，能聽到吾的聲音了嗎？=So, can you hear my voice now?
{{A}}這是什麼生物！？\n外星人！？={{A}} What kind of creature is this!? An alien!?
誰是外星人！\n吾是CATTLE！=Who's an alien! \nI am Cattle!
在現實世界裡，吾是{{A}}……\n就是WONDER背包裡的那隻貓頭鷹。=In the real world, I'm {{A}}.. \nthe owl in Wonder's bag.
啊、啊？\n那個……貓頭鷹先生？=Ah, ah? Um... owl-san?
喂，你這傢伙！為什麼要畫吾！=Hey, you! Why are you drawing me!
因為……這種造型，我還是第一次見到……=Because... I've never seen a design like this before...
說實話，我本來還半信半疑的。\n但沒想到{{A}}居然是真的……=To be honest, I was skeptical at first. But I didn't expect the {{A}} to be real...
啊，對了，\n剛才說的「WONDER」是……？=Ah, right, the "Wonder" mentioned earlier is...?
說的是我=That's me
是代號=It's a code name
r:"^(.*)同學就是WONDER啊？$"="$1-san is Wonder?"
在這裡我們都用代號相稱。=We use code names here.
代號……原來如此。\n那其他人也都有代號嗎？=Code name... I see. So everyone else has a code name too?
我是WIND哦。=I am Wind.
我是CLOSER！=I am Closer!
我是SOY。=I'm Soy.
然後，我是LUCE。=And I'm Luce.
這麼說貓頭鷹先生就是CATTLE……\n原來如此……有趣，太有趣了……=So owl-san is Cattle... I see... \nInteresting, very interesting...
喂，別畫啊、別畫！\n這都是機密！=Hey, stop drawing, stop! \nThis is confidential!
對不起，我一旦開始就停不下來……！\n還有這個景色，也讓我畫一下吧……！=Sorry, I can't stop once I start...! \nLet me draw this scenery too...!
喂，不能再往前走了啊！\n裡面可是有敵人的。=Hey, you can't go any further! \nThere are enemies inside.
啊……敵人？=Ah... enemies?
有一種叫「陰影」的怪物。=There are monsters called "Shadows."
陰影……它們長什麼樣子啊？\n我在這裡等著能遇到嗎？=Shadows... What do they look like? If I wait here, will I encounter them?
喂，不是讓你盼著見到它們啊！\n那可是超級危險的怪物。=Hey, don't wish to see em'! \nThey're super dangerous monsters.
是真的。不小心的話會被殺掉的。=It's true. If you're not careful, you could die.
噓。大家安靜。\n感覺有什麼東西在靠近。=Shhh. Everyone quiet. \nI feel something approaching.
{{A}}，是陰影嗎！？={{A}}, is it a Shadow!?
回現實世界吧=<size\=26>Let's return to the real world</size>
開車逃跑吧=Let's escape by car
沒錯。這裡離入口還比較近，\n直接回現實世界吧！=Right. We're still close to the entrance, \nlet's go back to the real world!
不，直接回現實世界更快。\n我建議離開{{A}}。=No, going back to the real world is faster. \nI suggest leaving {{A}}.
啊，要回去了嗎……？=Ah, we're going back...?
說不定是很危險的敵人。\n這次就聽我們的吧。=It might be a very dangerous enemy. \nListen to us this time.
好吧……\n那也沒辦法了……=Alright... \nThen there's no choice...
……不過，有點奇怪。\n我似乎感覺不到那個陰影的敵意。=...But, it's a bit strange. I don't seem to feel any hostility from that Shadow.
我也不清楚。\n但它馬上就到這兒了……=I'm not sure either. But it's almost here...
我也不清楚。\n但它馬上就到這裡了……=I'm not sure either. But it's almost here...
啊……啊！？{{A}}……！？=Ah... Ah!? {{A}}...!?
搞、搞什麼……\n本人的陰影，這、這怎麼回事！？=Wh-What... Her own Shadow!? \nWh-What's going on!?
{{A}}的陰影？={{A}}'s Shadow?
你終於打算找回它了嗎？\n那個你捨棄的東西……=Have you finally decided to take it back? \nThat thing you gave up...
這就是陰影……嗎？\n可為什麼和我長得一樣……=Is this a Shadow...? \nBut why does it look like me...?
你心裡應該明白。=You should know deep down.
你還要對自己「說謊」到什麼時候？=How long will you keep "lying" to yourself?
就這麼一直■■下去的話……=If you keep ■■ing like this...
你難道還想著，總有一天能■■■嗎？=Do you still think you can ■■■ someday?
謊言……？什麼謊言……我……=Lies...? What lies... I...
唔……又……=Ngh... Again...
{{A}}……剛才那是……？=Ngh... What was that just now...?
你就打算繼■對■■視而不見，\n永遠不面對■■嗎？=Are you going to keep ■■ing and ignoring ■■, never facing ■■?
不是的……不是的不是的……！=No... No no...!
關於■■的事……！=About ■■...!
別說了{{A}}！！！=Stop!!!
她昏過去了……\n趕快送醫院比較好。=She's unconscious... We should get her to a hospital quickly.
可是，那邊那個{{A}}……！=But, that other {{A}} over there...!
不見了……\n那到底是怎麼回事啊……=It's gone... \nWhat was that all about...?
雖然很想弄清楚……\n但現在當務之急是帶{{A}}回去。=As much as I want to figure it out... the top priority right now is to take {{A}} back.
我們回現實世界吧。=Let's return to the real world.
救護車把她送去醫院了。\n{{A}}她，應該沒事吧……=The ambulance took her to the hospital. \nWill {{A}} be okay...?
{{A}}陪著去了，說會聯繫學校的……={{A}} went with her, \nhe said he'd contact the school...
只能把她交給醫院，和{{A}}的{{B}}們了。=We can only leave her to the hospital and the {{A}} teachers.
我們也不知道{{A}}家的聯繫方式之類……=We don't know {{A}}'s home contact info or anythin'...
我現在在醫院=I'm in the hospital now.
{{A}}還沒恢復意識……={{A}} hasn't regained consciousness yet...
不過看樣子沒有生命危險，\n過段時間應該就會醒過來。=But it doesn't look like her life is in danger. She should wake up after a while.
{{A}}的班主任來了，\n我這邊交代完就回去。={{A}}'s homeroom teacher is here, I'll leave after talking to them.
注意安全=Stay safe
行，明天見=Okay, see you tomorrow.
{{B}}……還沒恢復意識，\n{{A}}她真的沒事嗎……={{B}}... She still hasn't regained consciousness. \nIs {{A}} really okay...?
難道說……\n是我們帶她去{{A}}才這樣的……？=Could it be... that it's because we took her to the {{A}}...?
別這麼自責，\n剛潛入的時候她狀態還好好的。=Don't blame yourself like that. \nShe was fine when we first infiltrated.
恐怕是因為她碰到了自己的陰影。\n不過……為什麼{{A}}的陰影會出現……=I'm afraid it's because she encountered her own Shadow. But... why did {{A}}'s Shadow appear...?
它是不是想傳達什麼？=<size\=29>Did it want to say something?</size>
那聲音很難聽清=<size\=27>The voice was hard to hear</size>
……現在說不準。\n畢竟{{A}}本人不在。=...It's hard to say for sure now. \nAfter all, {{A}} herself isn't here.
是啊……\n感覺它好像在跟{{A}}說什麼……=Yes... It felt like it was saying something to {{A}}...
先不說這個了。既然{{A}}的{{B}}去醫院了，\n應該也會聯繫她家人的……=Putting that aside, since the {{A}} teachers went to the hospital, they should contact her family too...
我們能做的也就這麼多了。\n今天就解散吧。=There's not much more we can do. \nLet's call it a day.
說得對。\n剛才的事，明天在秘密基地再討論吧。=You're right. Let's discuss what happened today at the hideout tomorrow.

Chapter 4 Part 3 Day 6
----------
我找{{A}}的班主任，\n問了一下她的情況。=I contacted {{A}}'s homeroom teacher \nand asked about her situation.
還沒收到她醒來的消息。=There is still no news of her waking up.
不過目前身體狀況穩定，\n好像就是單純地昏睡……=However, her condition is currently stable. Seems like she is just in a coma...
看起來不用擔心，\n具體情況我也不太清楚。=I'm not sure about the specifics, but there should be nothing to worry about.
好擔心啊=I'm so worried
謝謝你同步消息=Thank you for the update
一直住院的話，\n可能趕不上學園祭了……=If she stays hospitalized, she probably won't make it to the school festival...
{{A}}，不過我們也沒辦法。={{A}}, but there's nothing we can do.
好歹她也是我的學妹。=After all, she's my Kouhai.
但一直住院的話，\n可能趕不上學園祭了，\n她之前明明那麼拼……=But if she stays hospitalized, she probably won't make it to the school festival...
{{A}}，光擔心也沒用。={{A}}, there's no point in just worrying.
我們就做好自己的，\n為學園祭努力吧。=Let's just do our best and work hard for the school festival.
嗯，那放學後見=Yes, then see you after school
今天也加油排練吧=Let's rehearse today
行，\n一會兒見！=Okay, see you later!
行，\n待會見！=Okay, see you later!
等你哦～！=We'll wait for you～!

就是說啊！再這樣下去，\n{{A}}就參加不了學園祭了呀！=That's right! If this continues, {{A}} won't be able to participate in the school festival!
大家好不容易一起努力到現在。\n真希望她能在學園祭前康復……=Everyone has worked so hard together until now. I really hope she recovers before the school festival...
不過突然出現個跟自己長得一模一樣的傢伙，\n換誰都會嚇暈過去吧……=Well, if suddenly someone who looks just like you appears, anoyone would faint...
話說，那個真的是{{A}}的陰影嗎？=Speaking of, was that really {{A}}'s Shadow?
很有可能。但為什麼它會在吾等面前現身，\n就不得而知了……=It's very likely. \nBut why it appeared before us is unknown...
而且，{{A}}聽了那個陰影說的話之後，\n好像整個人都慌亂了起來。=Moreover, {{A}} seemed pretty shaken up by what that Shadow said.
我沒太聽清楚，\n它是不是說了「姐姐」之類的呀？=I didn't hear it very clearly, but did it say something like "older sister"?
感覺應該是和姐姐相關的什麼事……=Feels like it's about her older sister and stuff...
說起來，之前{{A}}提到過吧。=Oh yeah, {{A}} brought it up before.
{{B}}主角的原型，是{{A}}的姐姐？=The protagonist of {{B}} is based on {{A}}'s older sister, right?
她說她沒有姐姐=<size\=21>She said she doesn't have a sister</size>
原型好像不是姐姐=<size\=29>It might not be her sister</size>
啊，是嗎！？=Ah, really!?
唔……既然{{A}}自己都這麼說了，\n那也許她真的沒有姐姐……=Hmm... If {{A}} herself said that, then maybe she really doesn't have an older sister...
嗯，她也不像是會說謊的人。=Well, she doesn't seem like the type to lie.
但我確實看到過相關報導……\n難道只是謠傳嗎？=But I definitely saw a related report... \nCould it just be a rumor?
難道，那個陰影說的不是「姐姐」？=Then, maybe the Shadow wasn't saying "older sister"?
不對……\n它還說過下面這句。=No... It also said this.
「你要一直對自己說謊到什麼時候」……\n之類的。="How long will you keep lying to yourself"... \nSomething like that.
啊……沒錯，確實說過！\n這麼說的話……=Ah... That's right, it did say that! \nIf that's the case...
說有姐姐是謊話？=<size\=22>The lie was about having a sister?</size>
說沒有姐姐是謊話？=<size\=19>The lie was about not having a sister?</size>
確實，這麼想也沒錯……=That's true, thinking that way makes sense...
但有必要在雜誌採訪裡特意撒這種謊嗎？=But is there a need to tell such a specific lie in a magazine interview?
r:"^她對(.*)說謊了吧。\n可她為什麼要這麼做呢……$"="She lied to $1, didn't she? \nBut why would she do that..."
真讓人頭疼。\n吾等在這兒無論怎麼想都只是瞎猜。=This is troubling. No matter how much we think about it here, it's just guesswork.
真讓人頭疼。\n吾等在這裡無論怎麼想都只是瞎猜。=This is troubling. No matter how much we think about it here, it's just guesswork.
只能等{{A}}醒了，問問她本人。=We can only wait for {{A}} to wake up and ask her herself.
沒錯……{{A}}的事暫且放一放，\n我們還是先做該做的吧。=Right... Let's put the matter of {{A}} aside for now and focus on what we need to do.
好了……那今天也去{{A}}看看吧。=Alright... Then let's go the {{A}} today.
不過，「魔法錄音筆」的問題還沒解決……=But the "magic voice recorder" problem isn't solved yet...
但要是一直找不到{{A}}的位置，\n也沒辦法繼續改心啊。=However, if we can't find the location of the {{A}}, we can't proceed with the change of heart.
先儘量避免和{{A}}正面衝突，\n繼續往前探索吧。=Let's try to avoid direct confrontation with {{A}} and continue exploring forward.
好嘞，感覺沒人在注意我們……！=Alright, it feels like no one is paying attention to us...!
好，感覺沒人在注意我們……！=Alright, it feels like no one is paying attention to us...!
那出發吧。\n隊長，你來啟動{{A}}！=Then let's go. \nLeader, activate the {{A}}!

{{B}}！{{A}}！{{A}}！\n最棒！最可愛！公主最可愛！=Hey! Hey hey! Hey hey! The best! The cutest! The princess is the cutest!
{{B}}……\n{{A}}裡果然還是各種奇葩啊……=Ugh... The {{A}} is still full of weirdos...
之前因為碰到了{{A}}，所以直接撤退了……\n但看樣子這時她不在附近。=Last time we retreated because we ran into {{A}}... but it seems she's not around right now.
之前因為碰到了{{A}}，所以直接撤退了……\n但看樣子現在她不在附近。=Last time we retreated because we ran into {{A}}... but it seems she's not around right now.
趁現在趕緊往前走吧，\n找找通往上一層的路。=Let's hurry forward while we can and find the route to the upper floors.
上次就是在這裡止步的。\nWIND，能感覺到{{A}}的氣息嗎？=We stopped here last time. \nWind, can you sense {{A}}?
……這附近好像沒有。\n不過能隱約感覺到上層有什麼氣息。=...Doesn't seem to be around here. But I can faintly sense something on the upper floors.
那這層應該沒問題，往裡面走吧。\n去找找通往上一層的路。=Then this floor should be fine. \nLet's head deeper and find the way up.

{{B}}！？這裡原本的{{A}}的男友……\n玩偶呢！？={{B}}!? The boyfriend dolls that were originally here... where are they!?
不知道啊……可能是{{A}}拿走了？=I don't know... \nMaybe {{A}} took 'em?
嗯……真是這樣嗎？\n總覺得有點不妙……=Hmm... Is that really it? \nI have a bad feeling about this...
{{B}}……「這裡展示的是{{A}}在高中時期\n交往過的男性。」=Uh... "Here are the males {{A}} dated during her high school years."
「數量一共<color\=#ff0000>8名</color>。但很遺憾，沒有一人\n能與{{A}}匹配。」……大概是這樣。="The total number is <color\=#ff0000>8</color>. Unfortunately, none were a match for {{A}}." ...Something like that.
哈……說不定只是被全員甩了吧？=Huh... Maybe she was just dumped by all of them?
什，什麼！？=Wh-What!?
被困住了！？\n明明沒有別人啊……！=We're trapped!? \nBut there's no one else here...!
這些玩偶是……！？=These dolls are...!?
嚇、嚇死我了……\n居然突然襲擊……=That scared me to death... \nThey suddenly attacked...
看來必須小心這些玩偶……=Looks like we need to be careful of these dolls...
可惡……{{A}}那傢伙偏偏在這時候……！=Damn... \nOf all times for {{A}} to...!
糟了……要是現在被玩偶攻擊，\n我們完全沒法應付。快逃！=This is bad... If we get attacked by the dolls now, we wouldn't be able to handle it. Run!
呼，總算逃出來了……=Phew, we managed to escape...
又回到這個房間了……\n這次的問題是什麼？=This room again... \nWhat's the question this time?
回來了……那麼問題是：\n{{A}}在初中時代被告白的次數是？=You have returned... Then the question is: How many times was {{A}} confessed to during middle school?
被告白的次數……對了，\n來這裡的路上，遇到過會說話的雜誌……=The number of confessions... Right, we encountered talking magazines on the way here...
被告白的次數……對了，\n在來這裡的路上，遇到過會說話的雜誌……=The number of confessions... Right, we encountered talking magazines on the way here...
那時候聽到的故事裡好像有答案……\n還記得嗎，WONDER？=The answer was probably in the stories we heard... Remember, Wonder?
那時候聽到的故事裡好像有答案……\n還記得嗎，Wonder？=The answer was probably in the stories we heard... Remember, Wonder?
10次=10 times
14次=14 times
20次=20 times
是……這樣嗎？\n好像再多一點……=Is that... it? \nI think it's a bit more...
記不清了……\n但那也太多了吧？=I can't remember... \nBut that's way too many, right?
正確。那麼下一個問題……\n{{A}}在高中時期交往過的男朋友人數是？=Correct. Then the next question... How many boyfriends did {{A}} have during high school?
又是男朋友的事啊～？啊，對了，高中時期的\n玩偶展示過的房間有印象吧？=Boyfriends again～? Ah, right, remember the room displaying dolls from her high school years?
3人=3 people
5人=5 people
8人=8 people
不對，那房間裡玩偶應該更多些。=No, there should have been more dolls in that room.
正確。這應該是最後一個問題了。\n克服試煉，再回來這裡吧。=Correct. This should be the final question. Overcome the trial and return here.
還沒完嗎……不過，這時候說洩氣話\n也沒意義了。一口氣攻略到底！=It's not over yet... But there's no point in bein' discouraged now. Let's finish this!
哦，幹勁很足嘛，SOY！=Oh, you're fired up, Soy!
我也不打算退縮……但真的不想再見到那些\n詭異的玩偶了……=I don't plan on backing down either... but I really don't want to see those creepy dolls again...
不知道答案的提示藏在哪……\n得小心探索。=We're not sure where the hints are hidden... Let's explore carefully.
明白=Understood
我也會小心。=I'll be careful
好，那就出發吧。=Alright, let's go.
可愛！……超……超可愛！\n我們的……公主大人……美公主！=Cute!... Super... super cute! Our... Princess... Princess!
唔……這傢伙，樣子有點奇怪啊……？\n簡直就像喝高了……=Hmm... This guy seems a bit strange...? Like he's drunk...

唔……這傢伙，樣子有點奇怪啊……？\n簡直就像喝醉了……=Hmm... This guy seems a bit strange...? Like he's drunk...
嗯～？你們是……玩偶嗎～……？\n真是的，真麻煩啊～……=Hmm～? You are... dolls～...? \nUgh, so annoying～...
用這個的話……你們就會老實了吧……=With this... you'll behave...
啊——啊——啊，夠了！\n你們太煩了，給我閉嘴吧。=Ah- Ah- Ah, enough! \nYou're so annoying, shut up.
剛剛那個，是{{A}}的聲音……吧？=That voice just now was {{A}}'s... right?
{{A}}～……？怎麼沒用啊……？\n真是讓人頭疼的玩偶啊……={{A}}～ Why didn't it work...? \nSuch annoying dolls...
這傢伙到底是怎麼回事……不過，剛才那聲音\n是不是覺得能控制我們？=What's wrong with this guy...? But did it think it could control us with that voice?
看起來是這樣呢。原本以為人偶是基於\n{{A}}過去的男友的認知存在……=Seems like it. We originally thought the dolls were cognitive beings based on {{A}}'s ex-boyfriends...
難道不止如此……？=Is there more to it...?
似乎是我們誤解了=<size\=27>It seems we misunderstood</size>
嗯。也許不僅僅是男朋友，而是所有\n聽從{{A}}命令的人們的認知存在……=Yes. Perhaps they are cognitive beings not just of boyfriends, but of all people who obey {{A}}'s commands...
可以利用這個認知=<size\=28>We can use this cognition</size>
或許能阻止玩偶=<size\=26>Maybe we can stop the dolls</size>
原來如此。那就把這傢伙拿著的唱片\n帶走吧。=I see. Then let's take the record this guy is holding.
獲得了可以播放\n{{A}}聲音的唱片……=I obtained a record that can play {{A}}'s voice...

如果能把聯動項目談下來，\n我就不用被炒魷魚……！=If I can secure the collaboration project, \nI won't get fired...!
<color\=#ff0000>「魔法少女聖·治癒」</color>……\n應該是知名的女童向動畫吧。=<color\=#ff0000>"Magical Girl Saint: Healing"</color>... Should be a well-known anime for young girls.
記得聽說這部動畫的贊助商裡\n有{{B}}……原來是{{A}}的意思？=I remember hearing that {{B}} is among the sponsors of this anime... So it was {{A}}'s idea?
唔……{{A}}在{{B}}的影響力，\n比我們想像的還要大啊。=Hoom... {{A}}'s influence within {{B}} is even greater than we imagined.
包括{{B}}的事情在內，{{A}}在公司裡能\n肆意妄為，也能說得通了。=Including the matter with {{B}}, it makes sense that {{A}} can act so recklessly within the company.
{{A}}……為了不再被罵，\n得牢牢記住總編的喜好……={{A}}... To avoid getting scolded again, I must remember the editor-in-chief's preferences...
總編喜歡的角色是<color\=#ff0000>「黑迷霧」</color>……\n用黑魔法將敵人變成玩偶……=The character the editor-in-chief likes is <color\=#ff0000>"Black Fog"</color>... They use black magic to turn enemies into dolls...

都害怕成這樣了……\n到底遭受了怎樣的責駡……=To be this terrified... Just what kind of scolding did they endure...?
黑迷霧使用的暗黑魔法咒語應該是\n<color\=#ff0000>「變成玩偶吧！」</color>……=The dark magic spell used by Black Mist should be <color\=#ff0000>"Turn into a doll!"</color>...
變成玩偶吧、變成玩偶吧……\n絕對不能忘……絕對不能……=Turn into a doll, turn into a doll... \nMust never forget... Must never...
被{{A}}這樣控制心智……\n然後被毀掉的員工，究竟有多少……=How many employees have had their minds controlled and ruined by {{A}}...?
絕不能原諒……=Unforgivable...
一定要讓她償還罪孽=<size\=24>She must atone for her crimes</size>
是啊……為了不再讓受害者增加，\n必須由我們來終結這一切。=Yes... To prevent more victims, let us end this once and for all.
{{A}}……我也要完了……\n沒想到會是這樣的結局……={{A}}... I'm finished too... \nI never thought it would end like this...
這是……不僅是員工，連牛郎也？=This is... Not just employees, but even hosts?
如果為{{A}}效勞，\n她就會把我招進{{B}}當秘書……=If you serve {{A}}, she will hire you as a secretary at {{B}}...
我信了這話拼命努力……=I believed that and worked my hardest...
結果被狠狠利用……毆打……最後因為膩了，\n就被拋棄……我到底是為了什麼……=In the end, I was brutally used... beaten... and then thrown away because she got bored... What was it all for...?

前面是剛才那堆玩偶所在的房間。\n小心點，WONDER。=Ahead is the room with that pile of dolls from before. Be careful, Wonder.

好嘞！安全通過！=Alright! We pass safely!
好！安全通過！=Alright! We pass safely!

這裡可是{{A}}哦。\n哪怕到最後一刻，都不能放鬆警惕。=This is the {{A}}. \nDon't let your guard down until the very end.
你這傢伙，怎麼會在這裡……！=You, why are you here...!
這是哪位……？\n看上去是個生面孔啊。=Who is this...? \nLooks like a new face.

出於一些原因，現在算是「合作關係」。\n是吧，JOKER？=For some reason, we're "working" together now. \nRight, Joker?
聽、聽起來關係是有點複雜啊……=I-it sounds like a complicated relationship...
我們的關係稍微有點複雜。\n與其說是朋友……=Our relationship is a little complicated. \nRather than friends...

聽、聽起來是很難解釋的關係啊……=I-it sounds like a really hard relationship to explain...
重新自我介紹一下。\n我是「CROW」。=Nice to meet you again, \nI am "Crow".
我和JOKER他們達成了臨時交易，\n暫時加入{{A}}。=I made a temporary deal with Joker and the others and joined the {{A}} for now.
那麼……你們呢？=Well then... What about you?
做了自我介紹，\n講了雙方多次一起戰鬥的事……=<size\=27>Introduced myself and mentioned the many times we fought together...</size>
你是WONDER，那位是CATTLE。\n那就多多指教了。=You are Wonder, and you are Cattle. \nNice to meet you.
不過……還真是有意思。\n生活在不同世界的怪盜，居然能經常碰面。=Still... This is interesting. Encountering Phantom Thieves from a different world so many times.
啊，那個……？=Ah, um...?
啊！難道你是……！=Ah! Could you be...!
是的！\n我是{{A}}……不對，不好意思。=Yes!\nI'm {{A}}... No, sorry.
在這裡，請叫我VIOLET。=Here, please call me Violet.
VIOLET？但是你……=Violet? But you...
因為其他世界的{{A}}也在這裡。\n所以吾輩們不公開真名，互相只稱呼代號。=Because the {{A}} from other worlds are also here, we won't reveal our real names and only address each other by code names.
……原來如此。那就重新認識一下。\n{{A}}，VIOLET。=...I see. \n{{A}}, Violet.
嗯，{{B}}！\n原來你也可以召喚{{A}}呀……！=Yes, {{B}}!\nYou can summon a {{A}} too...!
我一直都沒發現。\n對了，你說的跟{{A}}的交易是指……=I had never noticed that before. Right, what deal you've made with the {{A}}...
{{A}}，說來話長。={{A}}, it's a long story.
說來話長……？=It's a long story...?
應該詳細說說=You should explain
一時半會確實很難講清楚。你們可以理解為，\n我在用自己的方式追求「正義」。=It's hard to explain quickly. You can think of it as me pursuing "justice" my way.
比起這個，先告訴我現在的狀況吧。\n你們應該更瞭解這個世界。=More importantly, could you explain the current situation? You seem to know more about this world than I do.
嗯……但在這之前還有一個問題。\n你怎麼會在這裡？=Yes... But first, I have one question. \nWhy are you here?
啊，不好意思。\n還沒聊過這件事呢。=Ah, sorry. \nI haven't talked about that yet.
那我就簡單說明一下。=Let me give a brief explanation.
今天探索了{{A}}的{{B}}，對吧？\n回去的路上，我突然發現手機有點奇怪。=Today we explored {{A}}'s {{B}}, right? \nOn the way home I noticed something strange about my smartphone.
冴……？=Sae...?
那是吾輩們在攻略的{{A}}，不用在意。\n對了，你說的手機很奇怪是指……=That's the {{A}} that we're exploring, don't worry about it. So, why did you feel strange about your smartphone?
沒錯，我發現「{{A}}」有異常波動。=Yes, I noticed a strange fluctuation in the "{{A}}".
這種情況以前從來沒有過。\n我就下了地鐵想調查一下……=This has never happened before. \nSo I got off the train to check...
結果導航開始把我引向「台場」的方向。=The navigation started and led me in the direction of "Odaiba".
那邊正準備新建一個體育場吧。\n到那附近之後，導航波動得更強烈了……=A new stadium is being built there. When I got close to the area, the navigation started fluctuating even more intensely...
我試著點了導航，就被傳送到這個空間了。\n大體經過就是這樣。=I tried tapping the navigation and was transported to this space. That's about it.
果然你也是從那裡……=You must've come from there too...
但你是怎麼到這裡的？=But how did you get here?
你是一個人到這裡的？=You came here alone?
啊，我沒找到出口，\n所以就到這個建築裡看看。=Ah, I couldn't find the exit, \nso I went to this building to investigate.
然後就發現，你們正在這跟陰影戰鬥……\n大概就是這樣。=And then I found you all here fighting Shadow...
啊。對了，我還沒向你道謝……！\n剛才多虧你出手相助，非常感謝！=Ah. Right, I haven't thanked you yet...! \nThank you for your help just now!
不用客氣。\n在{{A}}戰鬥方面，我還算有些心得。=You're welcome. I have some experience when it comes to fighting in the {{A}}.
原來如此……！那就請允許我向你學習。\nCROW……「{{A}}！」=I see...! Then please let me learn from you. \nCrow... "{{A}}!"
C、CROW……{{A}}……？\n算了，你要是覺得這麼稱呼合適的話……=C, Crow... {{A}}...? Well, if you think that's the right way to address me...
你到底有多少個{{A}}啊……=Just how many {{A}}s do you have...
一開始，我只稱呼{{A}}為「{{B}}」……=At first, I only called {{A}} "{{B}}"...
現在身邊經驗豐富的「{{D}}」真的很多呢。\n{{A}}，{{B}}，{{C}}……=Now, there are so many experienced "{{D}}" around me. {{A}}, {{B}}, {{C}}...
還有來自其他世界的怪盜——\n{{A}}，{{B}}！=Also the Phantom Thieves from other worlds- \n{{A}}, {{B}}!
算，算了，隨你吧。=F-forget it, suit yourself.
好了，言歸正傳。所以CROW誤入這裡，\n也是因為{{A}}發生故障，對吧？=Right, going back to the topic. It seems like Crow ended up here was also due to an error caused by the {{A}}, right?
應該沒錯。=Should be correct.
你們似乎經歷過幾次類似的情況，\n有找到逃脫的方法嗎？=Seems like you've experienced similar situations before, have you found a way to escape?
好像有，又好像沒有=Yes and no
好像不太行得通=Didn't seem to work
目前為止的逃脫方式……\n都是偷取一個稱作「核心」的{{A}}。=So far, our way of escaping... Has always been stealing a {{A}} called a "Core".
但在這個{{A}}，吾一直感受不到「核心」……\n吾等只好追著一股強大的氣息，戰鬥到這裡。=But in this {{A}}, I haven't been able to sense the "Core" at all... We can only follow a powerful presence, fighting our way here.
但什麼也沒發生，對嗎？=But nothing happened, right?
原來如此。\n對了，VIOLET你是第一次到這裡來嗎？=I see. \nRight, is this your first time here, Violet?
是的，我是第一次來這。=Yes, it's my first time here.
啊，但之前好像有被傳送到類似的地方……=Ah, but I think I was transported to a similar place before...
類似的地方？\n能詳細說說嗎。=A similar place?\nI'd like to hear more about this.
VIOLET他們說，\n曾潛入過類似的{{A}}……=Violet said they've infiltrated a similar {{A}} before...
謝謝說明。我大致理解了。\n簡單概括一下……=Thank you for the explanation. I roughly understand. To put it simply...
JOKER、MONA、WONDER、CATTLE，\n你們4人曾經多次來過「這裡」。=Joker, Mona, Wonder, Cattle,\nthe four of you have been "here" multiple times.
而「這裡」，\n就是不同世界的人可以同時存在的地方……=And "here", is a place where people from different worlds can exist at the same time...
另外到目前為止，每次被傳送過來時，\n你們都是和{{A}}的其他成員一起。=In addition, every time you were transported here, you were always with the other {{A}} members.
但這次卻不同。取而代之出現的，\n是我和VIOLET……是這個情況吧。=But this time it's different. Instead, Violet and I appeared here... That's the situation, right?
沒錯。=Right.
這麼說來，仔細想想……在這之前，\n吾輩們都是「{{A}}全員」被傳送過來。=Now that you mention it... Thinking carefully... Before this, the "entire {{A}}" were always transported together.
吾等也是如此。但這也可能是因為，\n去{{A}}的時候，都是全員集合後再出發……=Same here. But that might simply be because we always go to the {{A}} with all the members...
反過來說，這可以證明……\n「即使沒有全員集合，也可能被傳送過來」。=Conversely, this proves that... "Even without all the members, it's still possible to be transported here."
而且，我和VIOLET不屬於{{A}}，\n卻也出現在這裡，就更是意外中的意外了。=Furthermore, me and Violet are not {{A}}, which is the exception among exceptions.
記憶裡，我好像是被什麼東西引導著……\n來到了這個世界。也就是說……=From memory, it felt like something was guiding me... Leading me into this world. Which means...
這次兩個世界的交匯是一種「異常情況」……\n需要想想和之前不同的逃脫方法才行。=This time, the convergence of the two worlds is an "abnormal situation"... We'll need to find a different way to escape.
{{A}}，好厲害的分析能力……！={{A}}, you have great analytical skills...!
{{A}}，畢竟我可是「偵探」。={{A}}, I'm a "detective" after all.
什麼，偵探！？=What, a detective!?
啊，你不知道嗎？\n{{A}}可是遠近聞名的高中生偵探……=Ah, you didn't know? \n{{A}} is a famous high school detective...
也被稱為「偵探王子二世」。=He's also known as "The Second Coming of the Detective Prince".
……你們2個先停一停。\n之前還說不能在這裡公開身份的吧？=...You two stop for a moment. Weren't we just saying we shouldn't reveal our identities here?
總之，我和VIOLET來這裡是特殊情況，\n那麼把我們引到這裡的「意義」是什麼呢……=Anyway, since Violet and I being here is a special case, what exactly is the "reason" we were brought here...
想明白這個問題，\n也許就能找到逃脫的線索了。=If we can figure that out, \nwe might find clues on how to escape.
CROW不愧是偵探，\n頭腦真靈活……=As expected from Crow, a detective's mind is really sharp...
但是……對於擾亂世界的怪盜來說，\n偵探通常是宿敵一樣的對手吧？=But... For Phantom Thieves who disrupt the world, isn't a detective usually their nemesis?
在此之前的確會互相試探。\n但現在也算是合作關係了。=Until recently, we did test each other. \nBut now we're working together.
我仍然反對{{A}}的行事方法。\n合作只是為了抓住某個案件的犯人。=I still oppose the {{A}}' actions. \nThis cooperation is only to catch the culprit of a certain case.
某個案件的犯人？=<size\=25>The culprit of a certain case?</size>
反對行事方法？=Oppose their actions?
想知道嗎？\n這件事的話，告訴你倒是也沒什麼關係……=Are you interested?\nI don't think it's a problem if I tell you more...
你們的世界和我們的世界，\n應該有點區別吧。=Your world and our world, \nthere should be some differences.
是的，WONDER他們的世界裡，\n好像沒有發生那起案件。=Yes, in Wonder's world, \nit seems that case didn't happen.
……果然。\n在這種重大事件上會有所差異啊。=...I see. There are differences when it comes to major events.
算了，說起來有些複雜，就不細說了。總之，\n我和{{A}}在一起調查案件的幕後黑手。=<size\=27>Never mind, it's a bit complicated, I won't go into details. Anyway, I'm working with the {{A}} to investigate the mastermind behind the case.</size>
嗯，CROW的推理能力總是能幫上忙。=Yes, Crow's deductive skills always help.
謝謝，我也從你的想法中得到了很多啟發。=Thanks, I've also gained a lot of insight from your ideas.
算是吧。他們重塑精神的行為，\n是在法律允許範圍外的私刑。=<size\=29>Yes. Their actions of changing people's hearts by force, that is lynching outside the scope of the law.</size>
但是與{{B}}合作之後，我也理解了……\n為什麼他們被迫選擇{{A}}這種方式。=But after working with the {{B}}, \nI also understand... Why they were forced to choose the act of {{A}}.
被{{A}}的人，\n其實都是法律無法制裁的壞人。=<size\=30>Those who have experienced a {{A}}, \nare evil people who could not be punished by law.</size>
但就算如此，\n我也沒有完全認同你們的行為。=But even so, that doesn't mean I completely approve of your actions.
探索完那個{{A}}，把案件解決之後……\n我們再聊聊{{B}}的事吧，JOKER。=<size\=30>After exploring that {{A}} and solving the case...\nLet's talk about the {{B}} again, Joker.</size>
從你的想法中，我得到過很多啟發，\n而且，我也非常喜歡和你互相試探的感覺。=<size\=30>I've gotten a lot of inspiration from your ideas, and I like the feeling of testing each other with you.</size>
{{A}}……好吧。={{A}}... Okay.
我早就想說了……=I've been meaning to say this for a while now...
你們2個關係很好吧？=You two get along well, don't you?
怎麼了！？　\n我說了什麼奇怪的話嗎……！？=What!? \nDid I say something weird...!?
……究竟是敵是友，很難說清楚啊。\n畢竟怪盜和偵探立場不同……=<size\=28>...It's hard to say whether we're friends or foes. \nAfter all, the Phantom Thieves and a detective are on opposite sides...</size>
{{A}}，說關係好也沒錯吧。\n現在算是要一起從這脫身的同伴呢。={{A}}, saying we get along isn't wrong either. \nFor now, we're teammates trying to escape together.
好了，情報交換得差不多了，\n我們繼續往前走吧？=Alright, we've exchanged enough information, shall we keep moving forward?
一直在這裡聊下去，\n情況也不會有什麼改變。=Staying here and talking won't change the situation.
唔，說的沒錯。繼續探索吧。\n那就再次拜託你了，CROW。=Hmm, you're right. Let's continue exploring. \nNice to meet you again, Crow.
打倒剛才那個陰影之後，能去的地方變多了。\n先去那裡看看吧。=After defeating that Shadow, there are more places we can go. Let's check those out.

這裡是倉庫…… 吧？\n看起來是相當廣闊的區域呢……=This is a warehouse...? \nIt looks like a pretty vast area...
地方廣闊，也就意味著可能有好幾個出入口。\n千萬不能錯過正確的道路。=A vast area means there could be several entrances and exits. We must be careful not to miss the correct path.
沒錯，而且敵人可能潛藏在陰影裡。\n吾等一邊警戒一邊前進吧。=Right, and the enemies might be hiding in the shadows. Let's proceed with caution.

看樣子對面的電網好像能解除了。=Looks like the electric fence is disabled.
雖然還無法繼續向前，但穿過貨櫃的話，\n或許能到達下層。=Although we can't move forward yet, if we pass through the container, we should be able to reach the lower level.
好，那吾等先下去看看吧，WONDER。=Right, then we'll go down and have a look, Wonder.
哼，那個放哨的陰影……\n是相當強力的傢伙。=Hmm, that sentry Shadow... \nIs a strong guy.
怎麼樣，WONDER。\n做好戰鬥的準備了嗎？=Well, Wonder.\nAre you ready for combat?
果然如吾所想，這裡是個相當大的倉庫啊……=Just as I thought, this is a pretty big warehouse...
吾輩的鼻子都不管用了。\n雖然能感覺到從深處傳來敵人的氣息……=My senses are no longer reliable. Although I can still feel the enemies' presence coming from deeper inside...
這麼說，我們似乎在正確的道路上。\n現在只能依靠MONA和CATTLE的感知能力了。=So, it seems we're on the right path. For now, we'll have to rely on Mona and Cattle's sensing abilities.
嗯，那便無所畏懼地前進試試吧。\n走吧，WONDER。=Alright, let's move forward fearlessly. \nLet's go, Wonder.

喂！快看那裡。\n又是一個看上去很強的陰影……=Hey! Look over there. \nAnother strong looking Shadow...
那就是你們說的……\n「散發強大氣息的敵人」嗎？=Is that what you were talking about...\n"An enemy with a strong presence"?
沒錯。不知道為什麼……\n這裡到處都有那樣的傢伙。=Yes. For some reason... \nThese enemies are everywhere.
到處都有……也就是說，\n他們像是這個世界的守護者吧。=There are everywhere... That is to say, \nthey are like the guardians of this world.
不管了，打倒那些傢伙之後，\n道路可能就會開啟。一起上吧！=Doesn't matter, the road might open up after we beat that guy. Let's go!
原來如此，確實是個勁敵。=I see, that's definitely a tough opponent.
{{A}}居然連氣息都沒亂……！？={{A}} didn't even lose his breath...!?
雖然是個麻煩的對手，但只要攻擊他的弱點，\n或者從整體上把控好戰局，就沒問題了。=It's a troublesome opponent, but as long as we target its weakes, or control the overall situation, we'll be fine.
真厲害啊，CROW=That's amazing, Crow
真可靠啊=Really reliable
聽你這麼說我很開心。\n不過WONDER的實力也相當不錯呢。=I'm happy to hear that. \nBut Wonder's strength is quite good as well.
雖然口吻有點高高在上，\n但你的戰鬥天賦確實令吾輩佩服。=Though your tone is a bit condescending, \nyour combat talent is truly admirable.
不管怎麼說，\n畢竟你最近才覺醒{{A}}。=After all, \nyou've just recently awakened your {{A}}.
謝謝，MONA。\n我就當你是在誇我了。=Thank you, Mona.\nI'll take that as a compliment.
{{A}}也是「最近」才……\n那我可得加油了……！={{A}} is also just "recently"...\nThen I'll have to work harder...!
出發吧，{{A}}！=Let's go, {{A}}!
抱歉沒能及時扶住你……=<size\=26>Sorry I couldn't catch you in time...</size>
對，對不起。我有點太急切了……=S-sorry. I was a little too eager...
{{A}}，雖然有幹勁是好事，\n但也得注意別浪費力氣哦。={{A}}, while it's good to be motivated, \nbe careful not to waste your energy.
沒錯。我們都知道，\nVIOLET你比任何人都努力。=Right. We all know that you work harder than anyone else, Violet.
誰也不知道我們什麼時候能逃出去，\n所以一定要放鬆心態。=We don't know when we'll get out of here, \nso it's crucial to stay relaxed.
一起加油吧=Let's keep it up
我也還是個新手呢=I'm still a beginner
好的！謝謝大家！\n下次不會浪費力氣了……我會繼續努力的！=Alright! Thank you, everyone! I won't waste my energy next time... I'll keep doing my best!
嗯，氣勢不錯。\n好了，那就繼續探索吧。=Yes, that's the spirit.\nNow, let's continue our exploration.
啊，那是吾輩的臺詞！\n你這個{{A}}，別搶吾輩臺詞！=Ah, that's my line! \nYou {{A}}, don't steal my line!
唔……這樣嗎？抱歉。=Hmm... Is that so? Sorry.
沒錯！你這個傢伙真是……嗯？=That's right! You really are... Huh?
怎麼回事，怎麼不像之前那樣罵回來了？=What's going on, why aren't you yelling back like before?
你說誰是{{A}}！！\n你這隻臭貓！！=Who are you calling {{A}}!!\nYou stinky cat!!
你現在才想起來啊！！=You just remembered now!!
到底是誰在浪費力氣……啊，\n你也說說他們吧？VIOLET。=Who's really wasting energy here... Ah, why don't you say something to them too, Violet?

……VIOLET，你沒事吧？\n好像來晚了點。=...Violet, are you okay? \nYou seem to be a little late.
沒，沒事！我可以的……=F-fine! I'm okay...
……一直這樣逞強的話，也不太好吧。\n畢竟難得有可靠的{{A}}在身邊。=...It's not good to act tough, is it? Especially since I have such reliable {{A}} around.
各位……很不好意思。\n我可以稍微休息一下嗎？=Everyone... I'm really sorry.\nCan I take a short break?
謝謝大家。\n那我就不客氣了……=Thank you. \nI'll take you up on that offer...
以後也儘管提出來=Feel free to speak up
我也累了=I'm tired too
嗯，很抱歉我們沒注意到。\n稍微休息一下吧。=Yes, sorry we didn't notice.\nLet's take a short break.
VIOLET。\n我想，你的疲勞感……=Violet.\nI think your fatigue...
不止是因為……還沒有適應{{A}}吧？=Is not just because... \nYou're not used to the {{A}}, is it?
……不愧是{{A}}。\n果然瞞不過偵探的眼睛……=...As expected from {{A}}. \nI can't hide anything from a detective's eyes...
那個，能稍微給我一點時間，\n讓我說幾句話嗎？=Umm, could you give me a moment? \nThere's something I'd like to say...
多久都可以=As long as you need
說出來聽聽=Let's hear it
嗯，這裡也感受不到陰影的氣息，\n坐下來聊一會吧。=Yes, I don't sense any Shadow's presence here.\nLet's sit down and talk for a while.
我們也需要恢復一下體力。\n暫時就在這裡休息吧。=We also need to recover our stamina. \nLet's rest here for now.
呼……稍微恢復一些了。=Phew... I feel a bit better now.
在{{A}}裡說「恢復」，\n好像有一點奇怪呢……=It's a bit strange to say "better" in the {{A}}...
最好能去安全屋之類的地方啊……\n不過，你感覺舒服一些了就好。=It'd be best if we could go to a safe room or something... But, I'm glad you're feeling better.
所以VIOLET，你要說什麼？=So Violet, what did you want to say?
……其實，我一直在想……\n我和{{A}}被引到這裡的原因。=...Actually, I've been thinking... \nAbout why {{A}} and I were led to here.
看起來，你有頭緒了？=It seems like you have some idea about it, don't you?
是的。雖然我的猜想可能不太對……=Yes. Although my guess may not be correct...
大家一起想想=<size\=27>Let's think about it together</size>
謝謝。\n那個，稍微有點難以啟齒……=Thank you.\nUmm, it's a bit hard to say...
我覺得「讓大家捲進來的原因」，\n可能就是我自己……=I think I might be "the reason why everyone got involved"...
之前我也有提到過吧？\n我有一件苦惱的事……=I mentioned it before, right? \nThere's something that's been troubling me...
我……一直想從那個境遇裡「逃出去」。=I... have always wanted to "escape" from that situation.
就是因為這個想法，我才會來到這裡……\n我猜，大家都被我的想法卷了進來……=It's because of that thought that I've came here... \nI think everyone got caught up in my thoughts...
不想待在現實世界，想逃到什麼地方去……\n捲進了這樣一個「願望」裡。=I "wish" to escape to somewhere where reality doesn't hurt...
可，可是，即便如此，\n人類被捲進{{A}}這種事……=B-but, even so, for humans to be dragged into the {{A}} like this...
但……也不是不可能。畢竟對我們來說，\n這個{{A}}本身，原本也是不可能的存在。=But... it's not impossible. For us, the idea of the {{A}} was already impossible.
「想要逃避現實的願望」……啊。="A wish to escape reality"...
難道吾在無意識中，\n也想逃離那個「噩夢」嗎……？=Could it be that I, too, unconsciously wanted to escape that "nightmare"...?
雖然我不覺得自己有這種力量，\n但「想逃避」的想法，應該只有我會有……=Although I don't think I possess such power, \nthe thought of "wanting to escape" is probably unique to me...
回想起來，這裡的陰影也一直在說……\n「逃避」之類的話。=Thinking back, the Shadows here have kept saying things like "escape".
唔……好像確實是這樣。=Hmm... That does seem to be the case.
可能是我消極的情緒，\n和這個空間產生了連接。=Perhaps my negative emotions have formed a connection to this space.
……明明應該勇敢面對的。\n我真是太沒用了。=...I should've faced it bravely. \nI'm so useless.
這很正常=That's normal
逃避就是壞事嗎？=Is escaping bad?
{{A}}，可是……那些不得不面對的事，\n我都假裝看不見呢？={{A}}, but... Those things that I have to face,\nI just pretend not to see them?
明明應該勇敢面對的吧。=I should've been brave enough to face them.
與，與其說壞事……那個……=R-rather than saying it's bad... That...
明明應該去做的事情，\n卻放著不管的話……=If you ignore something you should do...
我……從某種意義上來說……\n也一直在逃避。=I... In a way... \nHave also been escaping.
被強加無法自辯的罪名，失去容身之地……\n擺脫這種困境之前，我無法抗爭任何東西。=<size\=28>Being falsely accused, losing my place of belonging...\nUntil I escaped that situation, I couldn't resist anything.</size>
但是，也有一種東西，\n只有透過「逃避」才能獲得。=However, there are things that can only be obtained through "escaping".
只有逃避，才能獲得的東西……=Things that can only be obtained through escaping...
沒錯。可以說，怪盜這種職業，\n被追擊就是工作的一部分。=That's right, you could say for a Phantom Thief, being chased is part of the job.
為了避免被「不自由」抓住，\n吾輩們以後也要不斷華麗地逃跑哦！=To avoid being caught by "unfreedom",\nwe'll keep making graceful escapes!
「逃避」這個感覺和行為，\n也不全是壞事啊。=The feeling and act of "escaping" aren't entirely bad after all.
這是追求新環境的願望=<size\=27>It's a desire for new environments</size>
這是自我改變的慾望=<size\=27>It's a desire for self change</size>
WONDER說的沒錯。=Wonder is right.
如果一味接受糟糕的環境，不做任何抵抗，\n只會殺死自己的意志……=If you just accept the bad situation and don't resist at all, you will only kill your own will...
如果沒有「逃避」這個選項，\n我也什麼都改變不了。=If I didn't have the option to "escape",\nI couldn't have changed anything.
拋棄習慣的環境，既需要勇氣也需要力量。\n逃避絕不是一件簡單的事。=Abandoning a familiar environment takes both courage and strength. Escaping is never easy.
不過……原來如此。=But... I see.
如果「想逃避」的意志就是問題的關鍵，\n那一起被引過來的我，也是一樣的吧？=<size\=27>If the will to "escape" is the key to the problem,\nthen it's the same for me, who was led here, right?</size>
不，我完全沒有這個意思！\n{{A}}想要逃避……這完全不能想像。=No, I don't mean that at all! {{A}} wanting to escape... I can't imagine that.
{{A}}，開玩笑啦。={{A}}, just kidding.
「逃避」既是人類想要改變現狀的慾望，\n也是一種希望……="Escape" is both a human desire to change the status quo and hope...
應該可以這麼說吧。\n既然如此，我們就稱它為「{{A}}」吧。=You could say that. In that case, let's call it the "{{A}}".
直到現在，我從來沒想過「逃避也可以」。=Until now, I never thought that it was "okay to escape".
我一直以為去面對、去嘗試做些什麼，\n才是正確答案。=I always thought facing things and trying to do something was the correct answer.
逃避……原來也可以啊。=Escaping... Is okay after all.
VIOLET好像想通了……=Violet seems to have figured it out...
……「逃避」啊。=..."Escaping".
你想到什麼了嗎？=Think of something?
啊，我在想……\n她的猜想可能是對的。=Ah, I was thinking...\nHer guess might be right.
雖然我從來沒覺得自己在逃避什麼，\n但可能……也未必。=I didn't think I was escaping, \nbut maybe... in reality.
有什麼頭緒了嗎？=Any ideas?
……嗯，怎麼說呢。=...Well, how should I put it.
就算有，也不告訴你們。=Even if there is, I won't tell you.
哎呀，話都說到這了，就講一講吧……=No, you've already said this much, just say it...
可從這逃出去之後，就沒有任何記憶了吧？\n說了又有什麼用呢。=<size\=29>But once we escape from here, won't we lose all our memories? What's the point of saying anything?</size>
算了，也是……\n眼下最重要的，還是要儘快逃離這個{{A}}。=Well, that's true... The most important thing right now is to escape this {{A}} as soon as possible.
是的，吾也這麼想。=Yes, I agree.
這前面好像也有強敵的氣息……=There seems to be a presence of a strong enemy ahead...
為了「逃離」這個神秘的{{A}}，\n吾等繼續前進吧。=To "escape" from this mysterious {{A}},\nlet's keep moving forward.
切，耍什麼酷。\n你這傢伙還是跟逃跑更配。=Tch, stop acting so cool. \nEscaping suits you better.
你說什麼，你這隻臭貓！=What did you say, you stinky cat!
你這傢伙～～～！！=You～～～！！
又吵起來了……=Started fighting again...
一直沒什麼精神的CATTLE，\n看起來活力滿滿……=Cattle, who's been so listless, looks full of energy now...
那個，我早就想說了……=Umm, I've been meaning to say this for a while now...
你們2個也關係不錯吧……？=You two also get along well, don't you...?
怎麼可能！！=Impossible!!
好了，那休息時間就到此為止了。\n繼續前進吧。=Well, that's the end of the break time.\nLet's keep moving.
嗯，走吧！=Yes, let's go!

似乎必須打倒這只陰影才能前進呢……=It seems that we must defeat this Shadow to move forward...
WONDER，做好戰鬥的準備吧！=Wonder, ready for combat!
從前方傳來強大的陰影的氣息……=Ahead is the presence of a strong Shadow...

那邊的電網好像解除了。\n來吧，繼續前進吧。=The electric fence over there is disabled.\nCome on, let's keep moving.
這是新的區域，不要放鬆警惕。\n還有…… 也別錯過寶箱哦！=This is a new area, so keep your guard up. \nAnd... don't miss the treasure chests!
這扇門不是普通的門啊。是電子鎖嗎？\n不過，它應該是鎖著的吧。=It's not an ordinary door, is it an electric lock? \nBut it should be locked.
這扇門和其他門不一樣，戒備森嚴，\n說不定在這門後面藏著什麼重要的東西呢。=This door is not like the others, it's heavily guarded, maybe there's something important hidden behind it.
比如說，是能讓我們逃出去的辦法之類的。\n要是這樣的話不管怎樣都得想辦法開鎖才行。=For example, a way for us to escape. If that's the case, we'll have to find a way to unlock this.
從這個房間裡面…… 能聽到奇怪的聲音呢。\n滋滋滋的，就好像有「電流」在流動一樣。=I can hear a strange sound... from inside this room. It's like an electric buzzing sound.
雖然不知道這聲音到底是什麼，但看起來\n還是值得進去看看的。打開門試試吧。=I don't know what the sound is, but it looks like it's worth checking out. Let's open the door.
喂，你啊，{{A}}…… 根據以往的經驗，\n這扇門肯定不會那麼容易自己打開的吧？=Hey, you {{A}}... Based on past experience, surely this door won't open itself?
當，當然知道啦！吾想說的是\n吾等在附近找找線索！=O-of course I know! What I want to say is that we should look for clues nearby!
那個陰影……\n感覺像是在看守著開關呢。=That Shadow...\nFeels like it's guarding the switch.
那東西看起來能用得上，真想拿到手，\n但看來非得戰鬥不可了……=That looks useful, I want to get it, \nbut it seems combat is unavoidable...
那就只能戰鬥了。\n上吧，WONDER ！=Then we can only fight.\nLet's go, Wonder!
{{A}}……！ 這個顯示幕突然亮了……！={{A}}...! This display suddenly lit up...!
……變得幸福…… 逃避……=...Become happy... Escape...
……變得幸福…… 逃避……\n到底在說什麼啊。=...Become happy... Escape...\nWhat is this trying to say?
難道是某種密碼……？\n算了先不管了，WONDER ，吾等繼續前進吧。=Is it some kind of password...?\nNo matter, Wonder, let's keep moving.
向著夢想的…… 彼岸……=Towards the dream's... Shore...
哇！ 這扇門，有聲音！？=Wow! This door, is talking!?
和剛才聽到的聲音一樣啊……\n是在向吾輩索要什麼東西嗎……？=It's the same as the voice we heard earlier... \nIs it asking us for something...?
可能需要給出回應。比如說……\n剛才的語音就是密碼之類的。=A response may be required. For example... \nThe voice just now could be a password.
原來如此，是能用語音開鎖的系統啊。\nWONDER，能給出回應嗎？=I see, it's a voice unlock system.\nWonder, can you response?
噢，門打開了！\n多虧了CROW的推理和WONDER的機智！=Oh, the door is open! Thanks to Crow's deduction and Wonder's wit!
好，那吾等繼續前進吧！=Right, let's keep moving!
感覺到前方有強大陰影的氣息。=I feel a strong Shadow ahead.
要是在這裡戰鬥，就意味著探索結束了……=If we fight here, it means exploration is over...
怎麼樣，WONDER。準備好了嗎？=Well, Wonder. Ready?

這裡也是…… 相當廣闊的地方呢。=This is also... a fairly vast area.
是啊，而且越往深處走，\n強大的陰影氣息就越近。=Yeah, and the deeper we go, \nthe closer the powerful Shadow's presence gets.
說不定能成為逃脫的線索。\n走吧，WONDER。=Maybe that will be a clue to escape.\nLet's go, Wonder.
啊……！\n那邊的門，又是特殊形狀的……！=Ah...!\nThe door over there has a special shape.
也就是說。我們又得去尋找\n打開這扇門的線索了，是吧？=That is to say. We'll have to look for clues to open this door again, correct?
切，快點去追蹤吾輩察覺到的\n那個特殊暗影的氣息……=Tch, hurry up and track the presence of that special Shadow I sensed...
沒辦法啦，千里之行始於足下嘛。\n開鎖和搜索敵人，吾等同時進行吧。=It can't be helped, a journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step. Let's unlock the door and search for that enemy simultaneously.
太好了，找到了。\n吾等感知到的特殊陰影……=Great, found it. \nThat special Shadow I sensed...
擊敗這個陰影之後，\n很快就可以逃離{{A}}……了吧？=After defeating this Shadow, \nwe can escape the {{A}} soon... Right?
也許吧。我們正在嘗試的……\n是一種前所未有的逃脫方式。=Maybe. Right now we're trying... \nan unprecedented escape method.
一定能逃出去=Will definitely escape
現在只能選擇相信了=Can only believe now
沒錯，現在別無他法。\n只能試試看了。=Right, there is no other way now.\nWe will just have to try.
強敵的氣息也逐漸減弱了。\n無論如何，應該是有些進展的。=<size\=30>The presence of strong enemies have decreased considerably. We should be making some progress.</size>
大家上吧！=Let's go, everybody!
太好了，贏了！=All right, that's done!
嗯，剩下的強大陰影氣息……\n應該只有「１個」了。=Hmm, there seems to be... \nOnly "one" powerful Shadow left.
也就是說……=That is to say...
是這個{{A}}的「核心」=It's the {{A}}'s "Core"
打倒它就能逃脫了?=<size\=24>Defeating it will let us escape?</size>
應該沒錯了……！想到接下來就是最後一戰，\n忽然有點緊張起來了。=That's right...! I'm getting a little nervous thinking about the final battle.
別擔心。大家齊心協力，\n無論什麼對手都能打敗。=Don't worry. If we work together, \nwe can defeat any opponent.
CROW，走吧？=Crow, let's go?
好，沒問題。=Yes, no problem.
嗯？怎麼了。=Hmm? What's wrong?
……沒事，沒什麼。\n走吧。=...No, it's nothing.\nLet's go.

剛才打倒那個強大的陰影之後，\n好像又出現了一股強大的氣息。=After defeating that powerful Shadow, it seems that a strong presence has appeared again.
嗯，但感覺這股氣息是從下層傳來的。\n它是怎麼移動的呢…=Hmm, but it feels like it's coming from the lower levels. how is it moving...
說不定，和我們一路走來的路線不同，\n還有別的通道。=Perhaps there are other passages that are different from the route we have taken.
比如說利用那邊的繩子，\n或許就能前往新的區域。=For example, by using the rope over there, \nmaybe we can go to a new area.
哦，這是個好主意。\n總之找找移動的方法吧，WONDER。=Oh, that's a good idea. \nAnyway, let's find a way to move, Wonder.
啊……！剛才的聲音是不是太大了點……！\n被陰影發現了嗎……？=Ah...! Was that too loud...!\nDid the Shadow noticed...?
好像是呢。不過幸運的是，\n敵人似乎還不知道我們的具體位置。=It seems so. Luckily, the enemy doesn't seem to know exactly where we are.
那吾等就應該把這當作一個機會。\n跳下去打倒敵人吧，WONDER！=Then we should take this as an opportunity to ambush the enemy, Wonder!
從痛苦中…… 解脫……=Free... From pain...
這個語音…… 又是密碼吧。\n對著門試試，WONDER=This voice... It's the password again.\nTry it on the door, Wonder.
嗚噢！ 這裡的電網也太多了吧！？=Wow! That's too many electric fences!?
門好像也被堵住了，\n看來除了解除電網繼續前進，沒有別的辦法了=The door seems to be blocked too, so there's no other way to proceed but to disable these.
那邊有個機器人！ 再用它來\n試試解除電網怎麼樣？=There's a robot over there! \nHow about using it to disable the fences?
吾同意這個意見。\n交給你來操作了，WONDER=I agree. I'll leave it to you, Wonder.
從現實中…… 超脫……=Detach... From reality...
從剛才開始就不明白這些話是什麼意思……\n到底是什麼線索呢……=I haven't understood what these words mean from the start... What exactly is the clue...
難道是想給我們什麼啟示嗎。\n…… 真讓人不舒服。=Is it trying to give us some revelation.\n...It's really uncomfortable.
不管怎樣，試著回答看看吧。\n就靠你了，WONDER=Anyway, try to answer it. \nI'm counting on you, Wonder.
幹得好。那吾等繼續前進吧！=Well done, let's keep moving!

這個地方的氛圍…… 總覺得有點可怕呢……\n那邊發光的門也很詭異……=The atmosphere of this place... feels a bit scary... That glowing door over there is also weird...
嗯，這個{{A}}到底……\n是仿照什麼建造的呢……=Hmm, what exactly... \nIs this {{A}} built after...
想太多也沒用，現在先繼續前進吧。\n敵人也越來越強了，要一邊警戒一邊走=It's useless to think too much, let's just keep moving. The enemies are getting stronger and stronger, stay alert.
切，開關被陰影監視著嗎。\n看來無法避免戰鬥了……=Tch, the switch is being watched by the Shadow. \nIt seems that there is no way to avoid combat...
怎麼辦，WONDER。\n做好戰鬥準備了嗎？=What to do, Wonder.\nReady for combat?
唔…… 又出現奇怪的陰影了。\n雖然不知道這傢伙是不是逃脫的關鍵…=Hmm... It's a strange Shadow again. Although I don't know if this guy is the key to escape...
既然吾輩被困在這裡，\n就不能放任不管。上吧，大家！=Now that we are trapped here, we cannot just do nothing. Let's go, everyone!
好，成功了。但是……\n還是覺得這個地方有點不對勁。=Good, we did it. But... I still feel like there's something wrong with this place.
那我們仔細調查一下這附近吧。\n說不定這和逃脫有關呢！=Then let's investigate nearby. \nMaybe it has something to do with escaping!

唔…… 大致調查過了，\n但還是不明白那種違和感究竟是怎麼回事……=Hmm... That's most areas explored, but I still don't understand what the dissonance is...
說不定有什麼地方被我們忽略了。\n比如說……「秘密通道」之類的。=Maybe there's something we've overlooked. \nFor example... a "secret passage".
原來如此，有秘密通道嗎……！\nWONDER，順著這個通道再找找看吧。=I see, a secret passage...! \nWonder, let's look for it along this passage.
哇，上面居然有這樣一條路……！=Wow, there's actually a path up here...!
那邊還能看到個像是開關的東西。根據\n之前的探索經驗，這東西應該能派上用場。=There's also what looks like a switch. Based on previous explorations, it should come in handy.
嗯，看樣子也沒有其他路了。\n先往那個開關的方向過去看看吧。=Hmm, I don't think there's any other way. \nLet's go to the direction of that switch first.
不過這裡也有電網……\nWONDER，先把這個解除掉吧。=But there is an electric fence...\nWonder, let's disable that first.
哦，門好像開了！\n果然這個開關就是開鎖的關鍵啊。=Oh, the door seems to be open! \nThis switch is the key to unlocking the door!
那我們趕緊去看看打開的房間吧！=Then let's hurry to that opened room!
但要小心。吾感覺到有強大陰影的氣息。\n千萬不能放鬆警惕。=But be careful. I sense the presence of a strong Shadow. Don't let your guard down.
果然這裡也被陰影擋住了……\n沒辦法避免戰鬥了……=As expected, this place is also blocked by a Shadow... There is no way to avoid combat...
能行嗎，WONDER？=Ready, Wonder?
答案是……“接納”……=The answer is... "Acceptance"...
又是語音密碼嗎……？雖然不知道\n是什麼意思，但先去打開那扇大門吧。=It's a password again...? I don't know what it means, but let's go open that door first.
逃避才是…… 真實……=Escape is... The truth...
逃避…… 又是這個詞……=Escape... It's that word again...
意味深長啊，但也別想得太多了。\n現在還是優先繼續前進吧。=It means a lot, but don't overthink it. \nLet's prioritize moving forward for now.
這大概就是最後一扇門了。\nWONDER，就靠你破解密碼了。=This is probably the last door. \nWonder, it's up to you to crack the code.
好，打開了！ 走到這裡可真不容易……\n稍微休息一下再繼續前進吧。=Yes, it's open! It's not easy to get here...\nLet's take a short break before moving on.

有種奇怪的氣息……\n這裡面，很可能就是讓這個{{A}}形成的傢伙。=This strange presence.... There's a good chance that someone in there is the one who formed this fake {{A}}.
沒錯，臭氣熏天。\n而且感覺是個勁敵，要加把勁了。=Yeah, it smells. \nAnd it feels like a formidable enemy, get ready.
你們覺得前方的陰影……\n就是{{A}}的核心……對吧。=You guys think this Shadow ahead...\nIs the Core of this {{A}}... right?
嗯，吾沒有感受到其他類似核心的氣息，\n也沒有其他強敵了。=Yes, I don't feel any other Core-like presence, \nand there are no other strong enemies.
那就上吧=Then let's go
打倒根源逃離這裡吧=<size\=25>Defeat the source and escape</size>
等等。在這之前……\n以防萬一，我確認一下。=Wait. Before that... \nJust in case, I'll confirm something.
VIOLET，你可以嗎？=Violet, is this okay?
{{A}}……？我嗎……？={{A}}...? Me...?
不，不好意思……\n{{A}}的意思是……=S-sorry...\n{{A}} means...
打倒前方的強敵，\n就有可能從這裡逃脫。=If we defeat the strong enemy ahead, \nwe might be able to escape from here.
但是，這……\n和「你」希望的不是正相反嗎？=But isn't this... \nThe exact opposite of "your" wish?
沒問題。=No problem.
我的確一直想逃避。從痛苦的現實裡，\n從巨大的壓力裡，當然……可能還有別的……=I have always wanted to escape. From the painful reality, from the enormous pressure, and of course... maybe other things too...
但是，如今我明白了「逃避也沒關係」。=But now I understand that "it's okay to escape".
比起以前那個「認為不能逃避」的自己，\n現在這個「逃避也沒關係」的自己……=Compared to my older self who believed "you must never escape", the current self who accepted that "it's okay to escape" is...
更加強大！=More powerful!
所以，就算回到現實……我也不會被擊垮的！=So, even if I return to reality... I won't lose!
從VIOLET身上，\n感受到了強大的生命力……！=Feeling a strong vitality from Violet...!
看來你好像想通了。=Looks like you've figured it out.
嗯，看著VIOLET現在活力滿滿的樣子，\n吾輩們心情也變好了！=Yes, seeing Violet full of energy now,\nour mood has also improved!
……有了逃避這個選項之後，\n好像內心反而有了底氣。=...So does having the option to escape mean you've gained inner strength?
CATTLE也高興了=Cattle is happy too
CATTLE也一樣吧=Cattle is the same
吾？不，吾沒有任何變化。\n從開始到現在，吾一直都活力滿滿！=Me? No, I haven't changed a bit. \nI've been full of energy since the start!
你這傢伙真不會說謊……\n你沒發現自己一直很奇怪嗎？=You really can't lie... \nDon't you realize you've been acting strange?
什麼！？哪、哪裡奇怪！\n完全、一點也不奇怪好嗎！=What? S-strange!\nNo, not strange at all!
你別挑事了！=Stop making false accusations!
算了算了。\n無論誰被戳中痛處都會尷尬的。=Forget it. Anyone can feel awkward if someone points something out to them.
吾不是說了嗎！吾好得很！\n你們有沒有聽吾說話！喂！=Didn't I tell you, I'm fine! \nAre you listening to me?
沒錯。你可能自己沒意識到，\n但你從一開始就怪怪的。=That's right. You probably didn't notice, but you've been acting strange from the start.
才，才沒有呢！\n吾正常得不得了！一如既往！=N-no! \nI'm perfectly normal! As usual!
你有什麼苦惱嗎，說來聽聽？=If you have any worries, let me know.
大家都很可靠，說出來也是一種解決辦法哦！\n{{A}}！=Everyone is very reliable, so why not try talking to them? {{A}}!
吾不是說了沒什麼嗎！\n吾好得很！好、得、很！=Didn't I say it's nothing! \nI'm fine! Fine!
比起這個，吾等更應該集中精神面對敵人！\n再不做點什麼的話，可就逃不出去了！=More importantly, we should concentrate on facing the enemy! If we don't do something, we won't be able to escape!
{{A}}，掩飾害羞的方式也這麼笨拙。={{A}}, you're also clumsy at hiding your embarrassment.
CATTLE說的確實是當務之急。=What Cattle said is indeed the top priority.
另外還要多加小心。\n打倒這個敵人之後，{{A}}可能就會崩塌。=Also be careful, the {{A}} may collapse after we defeat this enemy.
好了，走吧！=Alright, let's go!
一起回到現實吧！=<size\=24>Let's return to reality together!</size>
果然在這……！=Here...!
原來如此，跟之前的陰影氣息完全不一樣。\n看來會是一場苦戰。=I see. It's a different kind of Shadow presence than before, looks like it's going to be a tough fight.
{{A}}，怕了嗎？={{A}}, scared?
怎麼可能。\n你才是，準備好了嗎？=Impossible.\nThat's you. Ready?
當然，上吧！=Of course, let's go!

為什麼拔刀相向……=Why draw your sword against me...
我……「我們」……\n為了你們這些傢伙……=I... "We"...\nFor you all...
……？\n他到底在說什麼……？=...?\nWhat is he talking about...?
接受自我的意志吧！=Accept the will of the self!
什麼，這些傢伙……！？\n分裂了，給每個人賦予了某種力量……？=What, this guy...!?\nSplit and gave everyone some kind of power...?
這可能是大規模攻擊的前兆。\n先試著驅散每個敵人被賦予的力量吧！=<size\=30>This could be the precursor to a massive attack, try to dispel the power given to each enemy first!</size>
哼，雖然受到了攻擊，但並沒有什麼威力啊。=Hmm, despite attacked, it wasn't very powerful.
果然，驅散每個敵人身上的力量才是正確的做法。\n就照這個方向，大家繼續上吧！=<size\=29>Sure enough, dispelling the power of each enemy was the right move. Let's continue in this direction!</size>
{{A}}……！相當強力的傷害啊……\n大家都沒事吧！？={{A}}...! Quite powerful damage...\Is everyone ok!?
果然是因為賦予了分身力量嗎……\n抱歉，下次一定會驅散掉的！=Is it because they gave the clones power...\nSorry, I'll dispel it next time!
注意到了嗎，WONDER？感覺到\n那些傢伙的弱點發生了變化。先調查一下吧。=Noticed that, Wonder? I can feel the enemies' weaknesses have changed. Let's investigate.

呼，呼……\n我們做、做到了……！=P-phew...\nWe did it...!
雖然設法取勝了……=While it's good that we managed to defeat them...
嗯。與以往不同，\n{{A}}好像……並沒有崩塌的跡象。=Hmm. Unlike in the past, the {{A}} doesn't seem to... show signs of a collapse.
……接……接受吧……=...Acc... Accept...
好像沒能徹底擊殺啊。\n讓我給他最後一擊……=Seems like we didn't defeat them completely. \nI'll finish them off...
等等，CROW。=Wait, Crow.
如果……不繼續……做夢的話……\n那就……接……受吧……=If... you don't continue... to dream...\nThen... acc... accept...
接受……自我……逃避……=Accept... Self... Escape...
「自我逃避」……？\n喂，你這傢伙到底在說什麼……="Self escape"...?\nHey, what are you talking about...
接……接受吧……=Acc... Accept...
陰影好像一直在重複同樣的話……=The Shadow seems to keep repeating the same words....
……好像無法交流。\n這傢伙已經喪失自我了……=...Can't communicate at all. \nThis guy has lost themself...
應該是被吾等擊潰之後，\n他的一縷意識殘留在了這裡。=After we defeat them, a piece of their consciousness was left here.
「接受逃避」……啊。="Accept escape"... huh.
究竟是什麼意思呢……=What does it mean...
VIOLET的想法好像是對的。\n雖然沒有……百分百全對。=Maybe Violet's theory was right. \nThough... it's not perfect.
是指想要逃避的意志？=<size\=30>You mean the will to escape?</size>
回想起來，VIOLET一開始覺得，\n逃避是「壞事」，對吧？=Remember, Violet initially felt that escaping was "wrong", right?
但是在WONDER和JOKER的鼓勵下，\n你意識到「逃避」也是一種選擇。=But with the advice of Wonder and Joker, you realized that "escaping" is also an option.
沒錯。多虧了大家，\n我才改變了想法……！=That's right. Thanks to everyone,\nI've changed my mind...
但是……聽這個陰影的意思，\n逃離這裡的要素不止這一點。=But... from what this Shadow said, it seems like that alone isn't enough to help with escape.
接受自我逃避。\n不只是認識到「逃避也沒關係」……=Accepting self escape. Not just about knowing that "it's okay to escape"...
還要正面「接受」那個想要逃避的自己。=But about "accepting" the part of you that wants to escape head on.
接受……想要逃避的自己……=Accepting... the part of you that wants to escape...
也就是說……\n讓自己身上的新慾望萌芽……？=In other words...\nIt is the budding of a new desire...?
等等。仔細想想，\n迄今為止所有的融合{{A}}好像都是這樣……=Wait, come to think of it, ihat idea may also apply to previous fusion {{A}}s...
目前為止的所有{{A}}？=All the {{A}}s so far?
都是哪樣？=Like what?
「針對某種東西抱有強烈的慾望」……\n這就是關鍵的共同之處。="To have some strong desire"...That's the common denominator.
回過頭想想，吾等與JOKER他們，\n都有強烈的互相合作、共同逃離的慾望對吧？=Thinking back, I think that we, Joker, and the others, had a strong desire to cooperate and escape together, right?
……應該，是吧……=...That may be so, but...
等等。也就是說……盜取核心{{A}}，\n本來就不是「正確的逃脫方法」……=Wait. That is to say... Stealing the Core {{A}} was actually not the "legitimate means of escape"...
反而是盜取核心{{B}}這個行為，\n「強行解除了」{{A}}的融合？=Does this mean that the fusion {{A}} was "forcibly deactivated" by stealing the Core?
……可能是這樣。要驗證這個猜想，\n吾等需要試試接下來這個方法。=...That may be so. To prove it, I want to try what I'm about to say.
假設這個{{A}}持有「{{B}}」，\n那麼如果吾等接納它，會發生什麼呢……？=Assuming that this {{A}} holds the "{{B}}", what would happen if we accepted it...?
也就是「接受想要逃避的自己」……\n對吧。=That would be "accepting the part of you that wants to escape"... Right?
沒錯，我一直……都在逃避。=That's right, I've been... escaping.
除了藝術體操，我逃避了很多重要的事……\n但這樣子的自己……也是「我」的一部分……=I run away from many important things besides rhythmic gymnastics... But this kind of self... is also part of "me"...
認識到自己在逃避這件事，\n也許就是向前邁進的關鍵一步。=Recognizing that you are escaping from this,\nmaybe that's a crucial step in moving forward.
所以我願意接受。接受過去不斷逃避的自己，\n也接受未來的自己……！=So I accept myself. The person I was escaping from, and the person I will be from now on...!
沒錯，吾在內心的某個角落……\n可能也選擇了逃避。=That's right, maybe somewhere in my heart...\nI was also escaping.
但吾願意接受那樣的自己……\n接受新的慾望。=But I'm willing to accept myself as I am... \nAccepting new desires.
吾要把WONDER和同伴們……\n從噩夢般的場景裡拯救出來……！=I will save Wonder and his teammates...\nFrom that nightmarish scene...!
逃避既是追求變化的意志，\n也是邁向光明未來的勇氣。=Escape is both the will to pursue change and the courage to step toward a brighter future.
想要逃避的這個想法，可能也是自己身上重要的「慾望」之一……=The idea to escape, might also be one of my most important "desires"...
喂，快看！\n那個陰影！=Hey, look!\nThat Shadow!
接受……了……啊……=Accepted... it... ah...
聽上去……他判定我們「接受了」{{A}}。=From those words... He judged that we've "accepted" the {{A}}.
應該是。=Maybe.
但是，那傢伙消失之後，\n這個空間也沒有崩塌……=However, after that guy disappeared, this space did not collapse...
不過入口那邊奇怪的氣息消失了。\n現在說不定能逃出去。=But the strange presence at the entrance has disappeared, we might be able to escape now.
那我們快過去吧！=Then let's go over there quickly!
哦哦，似乎真的可以出去了！\n{{A}}竟然猜對了，可真罕見啊。=Ohhh, it looks like we can actually leave! \n{{A}} got it right, that's rare.
你這傢伙……！\n還是那麼嘴硬。=You...!\nStill as talkative as ever.
那……我們快逃出去吧。\n但在那之前……=Well... Let's escape.\nBut before that...
真的很對不起大家！=I'm really sorry everyone!
歸根到底，這裡產生的原因……\n應該就是我「想要逃避」的想法。=In the end, I think it was my desire to "escape" that got the better of me.
不，並不是只有你。雖然很慚愧，\n但吾也有……此種想法。=No, you're not the only one. I'm ashamed to say... that I had the same thought.
吾等都有所領悟，獲得了全新的慾望。\n這次不也收穫頗豐嗎？=We were able to gain new insights and new desires from each other. Isn't that fruitful?
{{A}}……\n嗯，謝謝你！={{A}}...\nYes, thank you!
CROW，你怎麼了？=Crow, what's wrong?
你在想什麼？=What are you thinking?
我從自己的角度推測了一下，\n形成這種{{A}}的原因。=I was speculating on my own on how this {{A}} came into being.
如果像CATTLE猜測的那樣，\n「擁有慾望」就是逃離這裡的條件……=Even if we assume that having desire is the condition for escaping, as Cattle predicted...
那引發這種現象的犯人，\n究竟有什麼目的呢。=What was the goal of the culprit of this crime?
……的確。=...Indeed.
對吾輩和JOKER來說，這已經是第4次，\n不能算是偶然事件了。=This is already the fourth time for me and Joker, it can't be chalked up to a coincidence.
雖然吾之前進行過調查……\n但最終沒能找到答案。=I've looked into this before... \nBut I never found the answer.
……前3次，只要盜取核心，\n就可以逃離融合世界。=...The previous three times, it was possible to escape from the fused world by stealing the Core.
但這次並不存在什麼核心。\n那麼到上次為止，都是「異常現象」嗎？=If the Core itself doesn't exist this time, then perhaps the previous events were "anomalies"?
我在想，犯人是不是並沒有料到……\n「偷取核心就能逃離」呢。=I think the culprit probably never expected... \n"Stealing the Core as a means of escape".
所以這次要防止核心被偷取。\n不知道是被藏了起來，還是原本就不存在。=So this time, they tried to prevent the Core from being stolen. I don't know if it was hidden or if it doesn't even exist.
也許從一開始，逃離的必要條件……\n就是讓人「擁有某種慾望」。=To achieve what was originally necessary for escape... Is to create some kind of desire.
嗯……也就是說，這個地方……=Hmm... This place where we gather...
希望我們和其他怪盜{{A}}擁有慾望嗎？=The goal was to make us and the other Phantom Thieves {{A}} have desires?
我不確定。而且，\n還有些事可能也與「慾望」有關。I can't be sure. Though, there are other points that seem to involve "desires".
JOKER、WONDER。\n你們明白我的意思吧？=Joker, Wonder. \nYou guys understand what I mean?
我們的世界和WONDER他們的世界，\n擁有相同「慾望」時，就會發生的事……？=This is our world and the world of Wonder's. This phenomenon occurred when we had the same desire...?
比如，當兩個世界都處於……\n「開始探索{{A}}的時候」。=For example, when both worlds are...\n"Starting {{A}} exploration".
確實如此……=That's true...
想起來了，是的=I remembered, yes
不愧是你們呢。\n沒錯，我也是這麼想的。=As expected from you two.\nYes, I was thinking the same thing.
也就是說，形成這裡必不可少的東西，\n除了核心之外，還有兩個世界「認知同頻」。=In order to form this world, the existence of a Core and the "perceptions synchronization" of each other's world were necessary.
比如這一次……\n認知世界是因為「{{A}}」而融合。=In this case, for example... This cognitive world is fused through the "{{A}}".
兩個世界「認知同頻」……\n是啊，如此一想，確實有道理。="Perceptions synchronization" of both worlds... I see, if you think about it like that, it certainly makes sense.
所以我推斷……=From that I deduced...
除了讓人擁有慾望，\n或許犯人還有其他「目的」。=The culprit may have had another "purpose" besides inspiring desires.
其他的目的……嗎？=Another purpose...?
嗯。比如說……\n「需要讓兩個世界持續連接」……之類的。=Yes. For example... \n"A need to continue connecting the two worlds"...
讓兩個世界……持續連接？\n這究竟是為何？=A need to continue... connecting the two worlds?\nWhy is this?
誰知道呢，我還沒想出答案。\n但假如真是這樣的話……=Who knows, I haven't figured out that out yet.\nBut if we assume that is true...
犯人的目的已經達成了。\n因為這次的認知世界並沒有崩塌呢。=The culprit's goal has been accomplished.\nBecause this world did not collapse this time.
再進一步推理就比較困難了。\n離開這個世界後，記憶也會消失對吧？=Whatever we do, it seems like it'll be difficult to deduce anything further. When we leave this world, our memories disappear, right?
啊……！不、不好意思。因為知道能離開，\n好像就放鬆下來了，肚子就……！=Ah...! S-sorry. I was so relieved to be able to leave that my stomach...!
{{A}}，沒關係。大家都會肚子餓的，\n我們也不會一直待在這裡……={{A}}, don't worry. I'm also hungry and we can't be here forever...
我的推理，就到此為止了。=That's the end of my deduction.
啊，無論如何，吾輩們先逃離這裡吧。\n我們能離開的時機說不定只有現在。=Ah, in any case, let's get out of here.\nMaybe now is the only time we can leave.
不過，吾相當佩服CROW的觀察力啊……=But, I am impressed with Crow's observation skills...
怎麼樣，要不要加入吾等的{{A}}？=So, how about joining our {{A}}?
{{A}}，這個時候來挖人？\n有點不太好吧……={{A}}, scouting at a time like this?\nThat's a bit...
{{A}}！\n{{B}}好愛開玩笑呢！={{A}}!\n{{B}} loves joking!
WONDER。\n這次也多虧你了。=Wonder.\nThank you again.
這次也多謝了=Thanks for this time
其實……我有一些話沒對大家說……=Actually... I couldn't tell everyone...
在我內心的某個地方，\n可能也存在想要「逃避」現狀的想法。=Maybe somewhere in my heart, \nI wanted to "escape" from my current situation.
JOKER也會這樣？=Even Joker?
這些話不像你的風格=<size\=27>This doesn't sound like you</size>
呼……被你這麼一說，\n我倒是多了些勇氣。=Phew... I feel like I get courage when you say that to me.
多謝了。=Thank you.
我們正在攻略一座「像是賭場的{{A}}」。=We are exploring a "{{A}} that looks like a casino".
等作戰結束後……\n大家再相見吧。=Let's meet again... \nWhen the battle is over.
像是賭場的{{A}}……？=A {{A}} that looks like a casino...?
該不會是，那個夢的……=Could it be, that dream's...
喂，WONDER。你在幹什麼呢？=Hey, Wonder. What are you doing?

對了……之後我會忘記2位{{A}}對吧，\n明明受了你們那麼多照顧，真可惜。=Right... I will forgotten about Cattle-senpai and Wonder-senpai, even though they took care of me.
吾等也是，VIOLET。\n沒關係……只要有緣分，吾等還會再見的。=Thank you, Violet. It's okay... If fate allows, we may meet again.
不過這還是第一次如此平靜地告別呢……But this is the first time we said goodbye this peacefully...
之前每次都是驚慌失措地逃跑……=Before, we always escaped in panic...
話雖如此，現在也不能太過悠閒吧？\n也許現在就是唯一能逃脫的時機。=Having said that, we can't be too relaxed now, right? This might be the only chance we can escape.
說的對……吾等快走吧！=That's right... Let's go!
那就再見啦。大家後會有期！=This is goodbye. See you again!
……下次再見，嗎。=...See you again?
{{A}}，沒什麼特別的意思。={{A}}, there's no deeper meaning to it.
希望下次還能見面。\n再見。=I hope to see you again.\nGoodbye.

剛剛是想做什麼來著……？=What was I trying to do...?
唔，你怎麼了，一副呆呆的樣子。=Hmm, what's wrong? You're spacing out.
手機出什麼問題了嗎？=Something wrong with your phone?
手機畫面沒什麼異常。\n這種奇怪的感覺……是錯覺嗎？=The phone looks normal. This strange feeling... Is it an illusion?
抱歉，讓你擔心了啊。\n到了{{A}}，吾的心情完全平靜下來了。=I'm sorry to have worried you. By the time we got to {{A}}, I had calmed down completely.
真不可思議啊……\n之前的時候心裡明明亂糟糟的。=It's strange... Even though my heart was in such a frenzy.
對了……剛剛來{{B}}，\n是為了讓{{A}}散散心……=Right... We came to {{B}} to help {{A}} relax...
r:"^胸口煩悶的感覺好像已經徹底散去了。\n謝謝你啊，(.*)。$"="It's like something has been weighing down on my chest has been lifted. Thank you, $1."
唔……這麼一想，\n肚子就餓了呢。=Hmm... When I think about it,\nI'm hungry.

這是基於您的認知所誕生的「{{A}}」。=This is a "{{A}}" born based on your cognition.
恕我僭越，我先行巡視了一圈，\n發現這個地方好像……=Forgive my presumption, but I took the liberty of looking around... and this place seems to be...
可以和現實中一樣，\n來進行購物或打工活動。=Just like in the real world, \nyou can go shopping or work here.
另外，這裡好像還有其他人類的氣息。\n如果看到他們，搭話或許也是個不錯的選擇。=Also, I can sense other humans around here. If you see them, striking up a conversation might be a good idea.
{{A}}，作為您的{{B}}，\n這只是我應盡的職責。={{A}}, as your {{B}}, this is just my duty.
……如果您的「認知」進一步擴展，\n也許還可以前往這裡以外的其他場所。=...Should your "cognition" expand further, you might even gain access to places beyond this one.
所以更加努力修行總是沒錯的……\n這是我給您的建議。=Thus, diligent training will always serve you well... \nThis is the advice I offer.
那麼，我就告辭了。=With that, I will take my leave.
古德拜！=Goodbye!
……這不是一種親密的告別方式嗎？\n有什麼奇怪的地方嗎？=...Isn't this an intimate way of saying goodbye? \nIs there anything strange about it?
{{A}}一臉困惑地離開了……={{A}} left in confusion...
總而言之……\n先在{{A}}逛逛吧！=Anyway... let's take a look around {{A}} first!

可能是我的錯覺，\n你看上去也像是知道些內情的樣子。=Maybe I'm imagining things, but you seem to know what's going on.
嚇到你了很抱歉，只是我的直覺罷了。\n你的事情，我不會再進一步過問了。=Sorry for startling you, it was just a gut feeling. I won't pry any further into your business.
表達了可以幫忙的意願……=Expressed my intention to help...
這樣啊……我的工作是維護城市治安。=I see... It's my job to keep the city safe.
只要能讓這座城市更好，我會不惜一切助力。=I will do whatever it takes to make this city better.
有空的時候就過來吧，能做的事有很多。=Come over when you are free, \nthere are many things you can do.
……當然，只要你做好了心理準備，就來吧。=...Of course, come as long as you are mentally prepared.

Aohige Pharmacy
歡迎光臨！=Welcome!
藥店的競爭還是那麼激烈啊，\n和以前沒什麼變化。=Pharmacy rivalry is still just as intense, same as it always was.
我們店都是多虧了特製青汁才能屹立不倒……\n承蒙惠顧了。=Our shop owes its survival entirely to our special Aojiru...
啊，我研發的青汁可是頗受好評的。\n所謂的獨門配方。=Ah, my homemade Aojiru is pretty popular... A real secret recipe, that one.
而且最近還引進了很多新口味青汁。\n根據用途，有不同的推薦。=On top of that, we've added a lot of new Aojiru lately... There's a recommended option for every need.
不過……可別把青汁拿去用在懲罰遊戲上哦。\n不能浪費食物。=But hey, no using Aojiru for dare games, got it? Food's not for messing around.
……看著你的臉，\n讓我想起了一位熟悉的顧客。=...Looking at your face reminds me of a regular customer.
你一定也是那種不會浪費食物的傢伙吧。\n本店特製的青汁，一定要喝一杯再走哦。=I can tell you're not one to waste good food. At least take one sip of our special Aojiru, on the house.
今後也拜託多來照顧生意啊。=Please keep supporting us in the future.

Fountain
水底散落著大量硬幣，\n似乎有很多人在這裡許過願……=Countless coins are scattered at the bottom, seems like many people have made wishes here...
噢，你也是慕名來許願的嗎？\n這裡的噴泉很靈驗哦。=Oh, did you also come here to make a wish? This fountain is known to be very effective.
不過……聽說硬幣不夠的話，\n噴泉之主可能沒法幫忙實現願望。=However... I've heard that if there aren't enough coins, the Fountain Spirit might not be able to grant your wish.
也不知道是怎麼流傳下來的，\n總之大家都這麼說。=No one really knows how this rumor started, but that's what everyone says anyway.
……所以，我就一咬牙，\n把今天打工的所有薪水都扔進去了。=...So I gritted my teeth and threw in all the wages I earned today.
對了，扔完硬幣之後，最好閉上雙眼，\n在心底多念幾遍自己的願望。=By the way, after tossing the coins, it's best to close your eyes and think about your wish a few times.
這也是不知道由誰流傳下來的小竅門，\n看你投緣，就透露給你吧……=This is another little trick that no one knows who started... But since we hit it off, I'll share it with you...
畢竟各種各樣的人都來這裡許願嘛。=After all, all kinds of people come here to wish.
所以，要想辦法讓噴泉之主記住你才行啊。=So you've got to find a way to make sure the Fountain Spirit remembers you.
不過，不知道為什麼……\n總覺得你會被噴泉之主特別眷顧。=But for some reason... I have a feeling the Fountain Spirit might favor you in particular.
可惡，我也想要變成這樣啊。=Ugh, I wish I could be like that too.

咖啡店=Café
這裡是「咖啡店夏卡爾」，我們經常來。\n{{A}}還在這裡打過工吧？=This is "Chagall Café", we come here often. Is {{A}} still working here?

簡直不像真實的客人。=They don't seem like real customers at all.
果然，和店員一樣。\n他們似乎「認知不到」我們的存在。=Sure enough, just like the staff. They seem "unaware" of our existence.
那應該沒法向其他人打聽消息了……\n其他店也是這樣嗎？=Then we probably won't be able to ask them for anything... Probably the same in other shops?

嗯……不過，我也沒抱太大希望啦。\n我們再去對面看看吧。=Hmm... Well, I wasn't expecting much anyway. Let's check the other side.
不行呢……\n從店鋪後門之類的地方也出不去。=Nothing's working... We can't even get out through the back door or anything.
啊，到底怎麼回事嘛。=Ah, what's happening.

啊，但如果這裡就是{{A}}內的裝置，\n人也都是失蹤者，就不奇怪了吧？=Ah, but it wouldn't be strange if this is a device inside {{A}} and all these people are missing persons, right?
至於為什麼是「{{A}}的樣子」，\n就不清楚了……=As for why this "looks like {{A}}", I'm not sure...

是的……但是=Yes... but

真是謎團重重……=<size\=28>This is all so mysterious...</size>
為什麼會和她母親在一起=<size\=24>Why would she be with her mother...?</size>
只是長得像……也不對。\n{{A}}管她叫媽媽呢。=It can't just be someone who looks like her... \nNo, {{A}} clearly called her "Mom".
……這是為什麼呢。=...Why is that?
嗯……{{A}}應該知道，\n她母親已經去世了吧？=Hmm... {{A}} must know her mother is dead, right?
sr:"^(.*)有發現什麼嗎？$"="$1, did you notice anything?"
其實……=Actually...
如果是{{A}}……=If it's {{A}}...

在我小時候……我父親……\n{{A}}，被捲進了……一場事故。=When I was little... my dad... was caught up in... an accident.
我常常想，能在他生前和他多說說話就好了。\n我很想再多了解父親一點……=I always think about how I wish I could've talked to him more while he was alive. I wanted to know more about him...
……所以，如果……父親出現在我面前，\n我可能也會接受。=...So, if... my father appeared before me now, \nI might accept it too.
「父親已經去世了，眼前的是冒牌貨」，\n即便我腦中明白這一點，也一樣。=Even if my mind knows, "He's already gone, this is just an imposter"...
如果有說話的機會，我想和他聊聊。\n問問「你當時到底是怎麼想的」……之類的。=If I had the chance to talk, I'd want to ask him things. Like, "What were you really thinking back then?"... or something.
果然，還是想再見他一面啊。=...I guess I just want to see him.
啊，我的事不重要啦。=Ah, but never mind about me.
我是想說，\n{{A}}或許就是抱著這樣的心情。=What I mean is... {{A}} might be feeling the same way.
無論她知不知道，\n這是一件「不可能發生的事」。=Whether she realizes it or not... this is something that "shouldn't be possible".

就算她們進了門，\n也不知道會被傳送到{{A}}的哪一層。=Even if they went through the door, there's no telling which floor of {{A}} they'd be sent to.

為什麼要現在做啊。=Why would we do that now.
算是……練習……？=Call it... practice...?
又不是兩人三足……=This isn't a three-legged race..
說回正題，如果她們進了{{A}}，\n還是挺讓人擔心的。=Getting back on track, if they really did enter {{A}}, it's pretty concerning.
如果出現了陰影，就必須一邊戰鬥，\n一邊保護毫無防備的母親……=If Shadows appear, she'd have to fight while protecting her defenseless mother...
{{A}}的{{B}}是什麼類型的？=What kind of {{B}} does {{A}} have?
可以幫忙導航=Can provide navigation
可以感知陰影的位置=Can sense Shadows
那說不定反而沒問題。=Then it might actually be fine.
{{C}}，我們的同伴裡有個叫{{A}}的女孩。\n她的{{B}}也是那種類型。=Well, there's this girl in our group called {{A}}. Her {{B}} is also that type.
{{A}}不小心闖進{{B}}的時候，\n好像能隱隱約約知道陰影的位置……=When {{A}} accidentally wandered into {{B}}, she could vaguely sense where the Shadows were...
在我們找到她之前，她一直躲著陰影，\n就這樣撐過來了。=She managed to avoid them until we found her.
如果是同一個類型，就算進入了{{B}}，\n說不定也能像{{A}}那樣行動。=If it's the same type, even if she entered {{B}}, she might be able to move around like {{A}} did.
另外，{{A}}本來算是戰鬥型，\n但也有一定程度的感知能力。=Also, {{A}} is more a combat type, \nbut she has some sensing abilities too.
她會利用通訊，告訴我們陰影在哪個位置。=She'd use comms to tell us where the Shadows were.
這樣的話{{A}}也……=Then {{A}} is also...
雖然更擅長戰鬥……=<size\=28>Though better at combat...</size>
告訴他們……\n{{A}}也有一定的感知能力……=Told them {{A}} has some sensing ability too...
原來是這樣！=I see!
那就算{{A}}也被傳送到{{B}}，\n也一定有辦法應對。是吧？=Then even if {{A}} got sent into Tartarus, he'd probably manage. Right?
不過……哪怕不像{{A}}那麼厲害，\n只要稍微有感知陰影的能力，就會很方便啊。=Still... even if it's not as strong as {{A}}'s, just having some ability to sense Shadows would be really useful.
這樣就能感知到走散的大家了……=We could track down everyone who got separated..
是啊……我們完全是戰鬥型的呢。=Yes... We're all combat types.
就像{{A}}說的那樣，\n有那種感知能力的話，確實會很方便呢。=Like {{A}} said, having that kind of sensing abilities would make things way easier.
你們想啊  如果能掌握敵人的位置  我們戰鬥起來也會更輕鬆=Think about it, if we knew enemy positions, combat would be a lot smoother.
這個陰影  是不是已經被打得不成樣子了=This Shadow... it's already been beaten to a pulp, huh?

啊，他也是{{A}}使用者……！\n好像不小心闖進了{{B}}。=Ah, he's also a {{A}} user...! Seems like he accidentally wandered into {{B}}.
他說和我們一樣，也跟同伴走散了，\n所以我們正一起找呢。=He said he got separated from his teammates, just like us, so we're searching together now.
原來是這樣。=I see.
初次見面……=Nice to meet you...
啊，自我介紹晚了，不好意思。=Ah, sorry for the late introduction.
我叫{{A}}。\n和他們在同一所學校上學。=My name is {{A}}. \nI go to the same school as them.
{{A}}是三年級，是我們的{{B}}。\n我們覺醒之前，他就已經在和陰影作戰了。={{A}} is a third-year, our {{B}}. He was fighting Shadows even before we awakened our Personas.
嗯。是一位很可靠的{{A}}……=Yes. He's a really reliable {{A}}...
對了……{{A}}一直是1個人嗎？=By the way... {{A}}, have you been alone this whole time?
進入那扇「奇怪的門」之後，\n好像就和你們走散了。=After entering that "strange door," \nI got separated from the others.
想著能不能和誰會合，\n我就先朝著{{A}}上層前進了……=I thought maybe I could meet up with someone, so I headed to the upper floors of {{A}} first...
……結果誰也沒能會合。=...But I couldn't find anyone.
再這樣遇不到任何人的話，\n我也不知道該怎麼辦了。=If this kept up, I wasn't sure what to do.
r:"^那和我們還有(.*)的情況，\n都差不多呢。$"="Then your situation is pretty much the same as ours and $1's."
我們也是回過神來，就發現自己1個人\n在{{A}}裡。這樣看來其他人果然也……=We also suddenly found ourselves alone in Tartarus. So it seems the others are also...
{{A}}的同伴有幾人？=<size\=25>How many teammates do you have?</size>

還有{{B}}和{{A}}。再加上{{C}}，\n一共10個人。=And {{B}} with {{A}}. Plus {{C}}, \nthat makes ten people in total.
是人的名字……？=A person's name...?
{{A}}是條狗哦。={{A}}'s a dog.
對。是會用{{A}}的狗。\n雖然是條狗，但那傢伙相當有膽量。=Yes. A dog that can use a {{A}}. \nEven though he's a dog, he's got real guts.
{{B}}超聰明的哦。\n至少比{{A}}腦子好使。={{B}} is super smart, you know. \nDefinitely smarter than {{A}}.
你之前不是說……\n「{{A}}是會用{{B}}的貓頭鷹」嗎？=You once said... "{{A}} is a {{B}}-using owl," right?
我們不怎麼吃驚，\n就是因為有{{A}}在。=We weren't too surprised, \nbecause we already had {{A}}.
對對。既然狗都能用{{A}}，\n貓頭鷹能用也沒什麼好奇怪的。=Right, right. If a dog can use a {{A}}, \nan owl doing the same isn't that strange.
雖然準確來說……\n{{A}}並不是貓頭鷹……=Though, to be precise... {{A}} isn't actually an owl...
算了，就這樣吧……=Well, never mind...
總之，一下子多了3個同伴，可以安心了。\n我在這層等了好一會。=Anyway, with three more teammates, I feel a bit more at ease. I've been waiting on this floor for a while.
啊，難道是因為有「守衛」嗎？=Ah, is it because of the "Guardian"?
沒錯。雖然有點想獨自挑戰，\n但萬一出了什麼事就麻煩了。=Exactly. I thought about taking it on alone, but t'd be trouble if something went wrong.
畢竟現在也沒有{{A}}的支援。\n還是儘量避免危險行動比較好。=Especially without {{A}}'s support. \nIt's better to avoid unnecessary risks.
確實，要是剛好遇到不適合自己的敵人，\n就算是{{A}}，1個人也不好應對。=True. If you ran into an enemy you're weak against, even {{A}} would struggle alone.
但其實，無論是什麼敵人，\n我都想用這雙拳頭取勝啊。=But honestly, no matter what enemy it is, \nI'd rather just crush it with my fists.
……總之情況就是這樣。和你們一起上的話，\n應該就能順利打敗敵人了吧。=...Anyway, that's the situation. With all of us together, we should be able to handle it.
打倒那傢伙以後，\n我們再分享各自的情報吧。=After we take that thing down, \nlet's share what we know.
好的，我沒意見。=Right, sounds good to me.
陰影就在裡面。\n大家準備好了嗎？=The Shadow is right ahead. \nIs everyone ready?
準備好了。=Ready.
陰影如阻擋前路一般佇立著……=The Shadow stands there, blocking the path...
……果然，是見過的「守衛」啊。=...Just as I thought, it's a "Guardian" we've seen before.
嗯。不過，{{A}}的情況很奇怪，\n千萬不能掉以輕心。=Yeah. But {{A}} is acting strange, \ndon't let your guard down.

是啊。果然等你們來是對的。=Yes. Waiting for you guys was the right call.
不過，說實話有點驚訝……我還以為，\n只有{{A}}能操控多個{{B}}。=But, honestly, I'm a little surprised... I thought only {{A}} could wield multiple {{B}}s.
是不是有什麼訣竅呢……=Is there some trick to it...?
{{B}}也想試試其他{{A}}嗎？={{B}}, do you want to try using other {{A}}s too?
倒不是想試……我是覺得要是有那樣的力量，\n戰術選擇就會更豐富。=It's not that I want to... But having that power would give us more tactical options.
如果能彌補我「波呂狄烏刻斯」的弱點，\n更強的敵人也能輕鬆應對。=If I could cover for "Polydeuces'" weaknesses, even stronger enemies would be easier to handle.
真是認真啊……=You're so serious...
r:"^話說回來，(.*)改變外表的事，\n也有點讓人吃驚啊。$"="By the way, $1's appearance change was pretty surprising too."
到底是什麼原理？\n是{{A}}能力的一部分……嗎？=How does that even work? \nIs it part of the {{A}}'s ability...?
具體的我也不太清楚=I'm not entirely sure
不過，我們對召喚器具體原理之類的……\n也不太清楚呢。=But we don't really understand the specifics of how our Evokers work either...
但我們第一次見到時也嚇了一跳。\n感覺整個人的氣質一下子就變了。=Still, we were shocked when we first saw it. \nIt's like his whole vibe changes instantly.
有那麼誇張嗎？=<size\=29>Is it really that dramatic?</size>
是這樣嗎……=Is that so...
嗯。和校服的反差還挺大的。=Yes. The contrast with the school uniform is pretty strong.
嗯。還有那個……面具？\n也給人一種「不可思議」的感覺。=Mm. And that... mask? It gives off a really "mysterious" feeling.
不過一起戰鬥之後就逐漸習慣了。=But you get used to it after fighting together for a while.
對了，你們到這裡爬了幾層？=Oh, right, How many floors have you guys climbed so far?
啊，差點忘了說！\n這個{{A}}感覺很奇怪……！=Ah, I almost forgot to mention! \nThis {{A}} feels really strange...!
原來如此。我走在這的時候也覺得有點奇怪，\n但沒想到居然到這種程度……=I see. I thought something was off while walking here, but I didn't realize it was this bad...
{{A}}沒遇到「門」嗎？={{A}}, you haven't encountered any "doors"?
沒有，我本以為已經爬了不少樓層了，\n但遇到的第一個守衛就是剛才那個。=No. I thought I'd climbed quite a few floors, but the first Guardian I ran into was the one just now.
返回裝置倒是有看到。\n不過，我看到的那些也已經壞了。=I did see some teleporters, \nbut they were all broken.
全都壞了嗎……=All broken...
讓人在意的地方有很多……\n但還是沒有足夠下結論的情報。=There's a lot that's concerning... But we still don't have enough info to draw conclusions.
sr:"^(.*)被捲進來的原因，\n說不定也和(.*)的異變有關。$"="The reason $1 got dragged in might be related to $2' abnormalities too."

我們的目標是和同伴會合，\n然後離開{{A}}。=Our goal is to regroup with our teammates and escape {{A}}.
r:"^而(.*)的目標，\n是尋找失蹤的同伴，以及一樣也要離開這裡。$"="Meanwhile, $1's goal is to find their missing teammates and also escape."
但是，出現了「從未見過的門」，\n進入那扇門就能到外面去。=But now, there's a "door we've never seen before", and going through it leads outside.
而這個「外面」，不知道為什麼，\n既不是{{A}}，人們的狀態也很奇怪。=Yet this "outside" isn't the {{A}}, \nand people are acting strangely.
……到這裡為止，我說得對嗎？=...Did I get everything right?
沒錯。啊，再補充一下，\n「門」最先出現的地方，是{{A}}前。=Yes. Oh, one more thing, the "door" first appeared at {{A}}.

反正也沒有別的路可以走，\n我們就繼續往上吧。=Since we don't have any other leads, \nwe should keep climbing.
好。我贊同。=Right. Agreed.
對了。在{{B}}看來，\n{{A}}有哪些地方變「奇怪」了呢？=Right. {{B}}, what parts of {{A}} seem "strange" to you?
嗯……大概是不管怎麼往上爬，\n都到不了「邊界樓層」這一點吧。=Hmm... Probably the fact that no matter how much I climb, I can't reach the "boarder floor".
至今為止倒是也有過……\n花費很長時間才到的情況。=There have been times before when it took a while...
但看這裡的內部環境，\n應該是整個{{A}}相當靠前的區域吧？=But the interior here looks like it's from the early sections of {{A}}, right?
雖然不記得準確的數字，\n但應該爬不到10層就會遇到「守衛」才對。=I don't remember the exact numbers, but I should've hit a "Guardian" before ten floors.
但是，我遇到剛才那個陰影的時候，\n已經爬了有兩倍以上的樓層了。=But when I encountered that Shadow earlier, \nI'd already climbed more than twice that.
要是讓{{A}}幫忙搜索一下，\n說不定還能發現更奇怪的地方……=If Fuuka could scan the area, \nshe might find even stranger things...
從這裡開始，說不定要爬更多層。\n你們3個可要注意分配好體力。=From here on out, we might have to climb way more. You three should pace yourselves.

希望如此。沒問題的吧，{{A}}很聰明的，\n應該不會抓來吃啦。=I hope so. It's okay, {{A}}'s very smart, \nI don't think he will attack him.

啊，真的{{A}}！=Ah, right!
說不定還有別的地方也不一樣。\n，我們去調查看看吧。=Maybe there are other places that are different. \nLet's investigate.
說不定還有別的地方也不一樣。\n我們去調查看看吧。=Maybe there are other places that are different. \nLet's investigate.
差不多「守衛」該要出現了吧。=The "Guardian" is about to appear.
也許是呢……\n得注意體力分配。=Probably... Pace yourselves.
對啊。守衛可是強敵，\n不能隨便應對。=Right. Guardians are strong enemies. \nYou can't get careless.
如果覺得吃不消了，就跟我說哦。=If you feel you can't handle it anymore, \njust tell me.

都爬這麼多層了，果然像{{A}}說的那樣，\n遇不到「守衛」呢。=It's been so many floors, just like {{A}} said, we didn't encounter a "Guardian" yet.
如果不用戰鬥就能順利前進，\n那當然最好。=If we can proceed without fighting, \nthat would be best, of course.
是嗎？我倒是覺得，偶爾來點強敵，\n測試下實力也很不錯啊。=Is that so? Personally, I think having some strong enemies every now and then to test our strength is pretty good too.

是啊。戰鬥這件事……\n我不介意和強者來一場酣暢淋漓的較量。=Yes. When it comes to fighting... I don't mind a fierce, all-out battle against a strong opponent.
當然，我本身也非常喜歡鍛煉。\n要想打出漂亮的一擊，核心肌肉相當重要……=Of course, I also really love training. To deliver a clean strike, core strength is super important...
你們怎麼了，為什麼一直盯著我。=What's wrong? Why are you all staring at me?

戰勝敵人真是太好了=Great battle
但還是沒什麼線索呢。\n{{A}}和{{B}}她們也不在……=But we still don't have any leads... \nNeither {{A}} nor {{B}} are here...

{{A}}……\n{{B}}，和平常一樣啊……={{A}}...\n{{B}}, same as always...
雖然情況有些特殊，但正因為如此，\n保持平常心也很重要吧？=Although the situation is somewhat special, that's why it's also important to stay calm, right?
現在有你們在，\n我也能盡情戰鬥了。=Now that you are here, \nI can fight to my heart's content.

看起來一樣=It looks similar
看上去有點像經常看到的那個門……\n但門上好像有什麼標記……=It does resemble the door we've seen before... but there seems to be some kind of mark on it...
總之，這次進門之前，\n先探索一下這層吧？=Anyway, before we enter this door, \nlet's explore this floor first?
嗯……雖然我覺得，會和上次的情況一樣。=Yes... Though I suspect it'll be the same as last time.
似乎到盡頭了，要折返嗎？=This looks like a dead end, head back?
返回吧。=Let's head back.

看起來是我們熟悉的{{A}}……\n但確實有種說不上來的違和感。=It looks like the {{A}} we know... but there's definitely an indescribable sense of unease.

沒錯。跟他們搭話也沒反應，\n對話內容也聽不清……=Exactly. They wouldn't respond when spoken to, and their voices were unclear...

不知道{{A}}他們有沒有和你講過，\n那些意外闖入{{B}}的「失蹤者」。=Not sure if {{A}} and the others mentioned this, but those who accidentally wander into {{B}}, the "missing persons".
意外闖入{{A}}的人，\n無一例外，幾乎都會陷入無氣力的狀態。=Almost all of them fall into a listless state.
如果會用{{B}}就不同了。覺醒前的{{A}}，\n也就是我們的同伴……她就沒有失去意識。=But if they can use a {{B}}, it's different. Like {{A}} before she awakened, our teammate... she never lost consciousness.
我們和你們的共同點，\n不就都是「{{A}}使用者」嗎？=The commonality between us and you is that we're all "{{A}} users", right?
……不過，{{A}}的母親很可能不太一樣。\n這點還需要進一步調查。=...Though {{A}}'s mother might be an exception. We'll need to look into that further.

但至少你們看到時，\n{{A}}並沒有類似的舉動對吧？=But at least when you saw her, {{A}} didn't act like that, right?
這樣的話，就產生新的疑問了。\n為什麼她沒有察覺到呢？=That raises a new question. \nWhy didn't she notice?
……難道她不是主動「接受了」這種情況，\n而是……=...Could it be that instead of "accepting" this situation willingly...
受到了陰影的某種攻擊……之類的？=She was attacked by a Shadow in some way...?
其實，我們之前和那樣的陰影戰鬥過。=Actually, we've fought a Shadow like that before.

對於被{{A}}允許進行「合體」的您，\n我想提出一個建議。=There is a proposal I wish to discuss with you.
對於我不由分說的引導，我深感抱歉，\n但是請允許我先帶您去另外的房間。=I apologize for the inconvenience. \nPlease, follow me.
勞駕您移步至此，非常抱歉。=Thank you for coming today.
希望您把這個地方當作接待室，\n{{A}}已經允許我們使用這裡。=Please consider this space a reception area. \nMaster has authorized its use.
……之所以將您引至此處，\n首先如之前所述，我是您的{{A}}。=...As you know, it is my role to serve as your {{A}}.
在您進行{{A}}的「慾望的鍛煉」的任務之時，\n我的職責就是輔助您。=I  must support you as you undergo Master's trial of desire, as is my duty.
經過慎重思考，我認為我需要「理解」您。=Therefore, in order for me to understand you better...
……恕我僭越，還請您參與我的「計畫」。=...I seek your cooperation in an agreement of sorts.
計畫？=<size\=30>What kind of agreement?</size>
你打算做什麼？=<size\=30>What are you planning?</size>
不用思考得太複雜，\n您只需要應對我的提問和要求即可。=I merely seek your responses to my questions and requests.
如果我能更深層地了解您，了解人的慾望……=I must acquire knowledge of you and human desire in thorough detail...
那應該就可以更好地輔助您，您意下如何？=In doing so, I may better support you. Are you amenable to this agreement?
確實，看來對我也是有益的……=It sounds beneficial...
請允許我向您表達感謝，那麼，\n這就開始執行計畫……=You have my gratitude. Now then...
……請回答第一個問題。=...Let us begin with my first inquiry.
您是，「偶像」嗎……？=Are you an idol...?
偶像？=An idol?
突然說什麼呢？=<size\=30>Where'd that come from?</size>
我在現實世界做了徹底的調查。=I have been studying the complexities of your world.
偶像有多種多樣的側面，\n是富有魅力的人類。=And it is my understanding that idols are charming, multifaceted individuals.
我本以為，擁有多個{{A}}的您，\n就宛如偶像一般……=As a possessor of multiple {{A}}s, \nI perceive you in a similar nature...
那麼，您是什麼人？……雖然很俗套，\n但是希望您能把對將來的「慾望」告訴我。=Excuse the cliché, but where do you see yourself in a few years? Please explain your desires for the future.
升學或者就職…？=College or work?
沒考慮過=Never thought about it
過得比較幸福=<size\=22>A reasonable degree of happiness</size>
據我推測，升學和就職應該有很大的差異吧？\n哪個才是您真正的慾望呢？=I presume the two are quite different. \nWhich is your true desire?
那麼，希望您現在在此考慮一下，\n這對您來說，應該是無法回避的問題。=Then please take the opportunity to do so.\nSurely this is a decision you cannot ignore...
比較？具體應該是怎樣一個程度？\n希望您能描述一下明確的畫面。=A reasonable degree? Could you describe that more precisely? I wish for a clear answer.
雖然嘗試著儘量用語言表達了，但感覺還是很抽象……=I explained as best I could, but it still came out vague...
唔，也就是說，\n您自己還在探索自己到底是什麼樣的人……=Hm. In short, you are still trying to find yourself...
那麼，恕我僭越，\n請允許我把計畫升級為「特別計畫」。=In which case, if I may be so bold, I will upgrade our agreement to a special contract.
我希望您把我指定的{{A}}帶過來。=I would like you to bring the {{A}} I specify back here to me.
之前也和您說過，\n{{A}}就是您的人格。=As I told you before, a {{A}} is a part of one's personality.
我會透過{{A}}來領會想像中的「您」，\n並逐漸地理解您……希望您能理解這一點。=I believe my image of you may be further fleshed out by a look at your {{A}}.
那麼……請把<color\=#ff0000>{{A}}</color>帶過來。=Please bring me <color\=#ff0000>{{A}}</color>.
……不，請允許我為自己的無禮道歉。\n僅僅這樣的話，對您來說太簡單了……=...Wait, my apologies. Such a task must be mere child's play for you.
r:"^希望您把具有<color\=#ff0000>幸運拳</color>的<color\=#ff0000>{{A}}</color>拿過來。$"="I request a <color\=#ff0000>{{A}}</color> with <color\=#ff0000>Lucky Punch</color>."
我可以深入對您的理解，\n您也會得到更有效果的輔助……=This will allow me to better understand you and thus provide you more effective support...
這個關係……借用人類語言的話，\n就是「雙贏」，希望我們都能這麼理解。=I believe this is what humans call a "win-win."
那麼，這次就到這裡。\n特別計畫的事情，希望您能積極地考慮一下。=That shall be all for today. \nI hope our special contract proves fruitful.

Rank 5
r:"^……嗯？(.*)大人。\n看來您把我指定的(.*)帶來了。$"="...Oh? $1-sama. You have brought the $2 I requested."
我對此理解為，\n您有想要推進特別計畫的慾望了。=I take it you are eager to fulfill our contract.
透過您帶來的{{A}}，\n我更加了解您了……=With the {{A}} you have brought, \nI have come to understand you further.
……正如所預想的作用。=Just as I expected...
{{A}}之前也說過類似的話，\n這個房間反映的就是您內心的景象……=Similar to what my master has told you of\nthis realm, this very room is a reflection of yourself.
因此，把新的{{A}}帶進來，\n就等於是擴充了您自身的可能性。=Therefore, bringing a new {{A}} here will expand your own potential as well.
{{A}}的「便利性」提升了，\n您可以這樣理解。=Please be aware that the functions of the {{A}} have now been upgraded.
那麼……=Well then...
在請您體驗了一連串的特別計畫後，\n我比以前更加理解您了。=Our contract is proving fruitful.\nI understand you more deeply than before.
但是，我覺得理解得還不夠充分……\n因此，我又想問個問題……=However, I am not yet satisfied... \nSo I shall ask you another question...
您自己是否曾經有過\n「我可能跟偶像非常相似？」這樣的想法？=Have you ever considered that you yourself resemble an idol?
又是偶像？=Idols again?
沒這麼想過……=Not even once...
你喜歡偶像嗎？=<size\=24>So do you just like idols then?</size>
我的職責就是了解您，\n為了履行職責，不論多少次我都會提問的。=It is my duty to understand you. \nI shall ask as many times as necessary.
是這樣嗎？因為我認為，\n您應該具有這樣的天資……=Is that so? It is quite evident to me that you possess such qualities...
如果這能成為了解您的線索，\n至少請允許我斷言「我並不討厭」。=If they allow me to understand you, I shall say I do not hate them.
我聽說，偶像會在不同的時候，\n表現出不同的面孔……這即是戴著「面具」。=I hear idols possess several distinct faces.\nIn short, they don various "masks."
據我理解，像您這樣有著眾多{{A}}的人，\n應該也可以從那樣的狀態中學習到些什麼。=If idols indeed possess multiple {{A}}s like you, there is much we can learn from them.
因此，\n我希望您能和我一起學習關於偶像的知識。=Therefore, I would like us to study idols together.
感覺有點牽強……=<size\=22>You seem very eager about this...</size>
我理解，您的這個回答，\n是您和我認知一致的證明。=I take it we are in agreement.
……這個特別計畫的方針也得到了您的理解，\n這讓我很高興。=...I am pleased that you are amenable to the conditions of our contract.
今後也不僅僅是我單方面的輔助，而是繼續，\n以「雙贏」為目標，希望您能這麼理解。=I do aim for this to be a mutually beneficial arrangement. A win-win, as you call it.
……那麼，請允許我繼續推進特別計畫。=...Now allow me to state my next request.
r:"^希望您把具有<color\=#ff0000>塔爾卡加</color>的\n<color\=#ff0000>{{A}}</color>拿過來。$"="I request a <color\=#ff0000>{{A}}</color> with <color\=#ff0000>Tarukaja</color>."

Rank 7
我對您又產生了新的了解。\n這讓我感到了身為{{A}}的工作意義。=I feel I now understand you better. \nAs your {{A}}, I am truly grateful.
特別計畫的進展很順利，\n因此，這次我有另外的事情想驗證一下。=Our contract is proceeding smoothly,\nbut there is something I would like to confirm with you.
希望您看一下。=Please watch carefully.
我希望您能擺出與此相同的姿勢。=I would like you to make these poses.
非做不可嗎？=Do I have to?
果斷拒絕=Absolutely not
希望你解釋一下……=Care to explain?
希望您務必能付諸行動，\n這是為您所設計的重要的驗證。=I implore you to try. For your sake, \nI must confirm that you can do this.
雖然能明確表明自己的態度，這一點非常好，\n但希望您在此能委曲求全一下。=I do appreciate your directness, \nbut please reconsider.
據說以這個姿勢為契機，\n一名少女走上了名為偶像的命運之路……=With this pose, a young girl changed her fate...
甚至後續還步上了明星這個臺階……=...and rose to stardom as an idol.
既然這個特別計畫也是為了讓您免遭{{A}}，\n那麼我認為這對您是有益的。=I believe this pose may be highly beneficial to you and your efforts to escape ruin.
……好了，作為您的{{A}}，\n我希望您這麼做，請儘快擺出姿勢。=...This is my hope for you, as your {{A}}. \nNow please, begin whenever you are ready.
看來，不做的話，就聊不下去了……=I don't think she's going to let this go...
恕我僭越，\n希望您能忠實地再現腿的角度。=Forgive my audacity, \nbut please adjust the angle of your feet.
如果不是完美的複製，\n是無法從中獲得啟迪的。=We cannot reap the full benefits unless your positioning is perfect.
r:"^不愧是(.*)大人，\n理解得非常快。$"="As I expected of you, $1-sama.\nYou learn quickly."
如果是您的話，應該可以定下更高的目標……\n希望您能繼續完全複製我的姿勢。=But surely you can aim even higher... \nPlease copy each of these poses perfectly.
好了，這是發揮您的可能性的時候。=Come. It is time to unleash your potential.
都已經到這一步了，看來只能去做了……=Looks like I'll have to go\nalong with this...
甚至不用演練，就能完美地再現……=You've recreated every pose perfectly.\nWithout any rehearsal for that matter...
您果然沒有辜負我的期望。=You have gone far beyond my expectations.\nSurely, you must feel it too.
您也已經注意到了吧，自己的可能性……！=Yes. There is talent within you...!
感謝您擺出這些姿勢，\n您的造型超出了我的預期。=Thank you for posing for me. I have no further poses to request of you at present.
我本以為這個指定可能還為時過早，\n但如果是已經掌握了那個姿勢的您……=I assumed it would be too soon for you to take on my next assignment, but seeing as you mastered the posing so skillfully...

實地？=On-site?
對於我不由分說的引導，我深感抱歉，\n但是請您與我同行。=I apologize for the short notice, \nbut I ask that you accompany me.
您可能已經知道了，這裡是{{A}}。\n我調查過，這裡是偶像的聖地。=As you must already know, this is {{A}}.\nI understand it to be a gathering place for idols.
為什麼來這？=Why are we here?
又是偶像……=Again with the idols...
現在這條街上的偶像們群雄割據，\n到處都有偶像在舉辦商業活動。=At present, this town is a battlefield. \nIdols are present everywhere.

人家逃跑了……=They ran away...
你就那麼在意攝影會？=<size\=25>You really want a photo, huh?</size>
……原來如此，對方逃跑的話，就會想追過去，\n我推測這是紮根在本能中的商業手段。=...I see. I assume that by running away, \nthey incite their fans to give chase.
偶像果然很深奧啊，\n我的判斷是正確的。=My assessment was accurate. \nIdols are indeed profoundly interesting.

我想向{{A}}呈現我的愛。=I hope it will be sufficient to convey my love for you, {{A}}.
收到您的點單了！\n給您上呼叫愛情的蛋包飯～=Great! One order of Fave Omelette Rice～!
剛才的點單究竟是……？=What the...
我要求你解釋一下=Explain
正如我剛才所說的，\n希望您能將其理解為概念咖的禮法。=As I mentioned, that was standard con café etiquette.
向推點蛋包飯，\n這是基礎中的基礎。=Ordering omelette rice from one's "fave" is the most basic of basic rules of conduct.
讓您久等啦～\n這是您點的呼叫愛情的蛋包飯～！=Thanks for waiting～! \nHere is your Fave Omelette Rice～!
大姐姐叫什麼名字？=What's your name, miss?
希望您能稱呼我為{{A}}。=I am {{A}}.
好～的！那麼……\n{{A}}最喜歡的人是～？=Got it～! So... Who's your favorite, {{A}}?
{{A}}～～！！={{A}}～～!!
好～！大家最喜歡的{{B}}♪\n就是我，{{A}}！=That's right! Everyone's number-one fave, {{B}}, {{A}}♪
為什麼突然打起招呼來了？=What's with the intro?
我強烈要求你解釋一下=<size\=25>Will somebody please explain!?</size>
這是偶像基礎的自我介紹，\n以及對此應有的反應。=This is an idol's basic introductory call and response.
您只需要理解，儘管觀眾只有我和您，\n但{{A}}還是在盡全力地接待客人。=We may be her only audience at present, but please note that {{A}} gives her all no matter what.
燦爛的笑容、通透的聲音、\n充分與我對視的表現……=Behold her brilliant smile, her pure voice, her gaze that unshakably meets my own...
這些全都與吸引人的魅力有關。=Her performance has an irresistible charm.
據我了解，還存在其他很多種，\n能夠感受到{{A}}的美妙之處的菜單。=I believe that there are countless items on this menu that embody {{A}}'s charm.
就算是為了您的成長，\n我也認為有必要全部都嘗試一遍。=For the sake of your personal growth, \nwe must sample them all.
好深奧啊……=That's deep...
這真的有意義嗎？=What's the point?
只是{{A}}想點單吧？=<size\=26>You just want to order more</size>
不愧是您，能夠理解概念咖的偶像，\n這正是很深奧的存在。=I knew you would understand. Con café idols are indisputably sophisticated.
希望您能信賴我的觀察力，\n這是絕不能落於人後的事情。=I ask that you have faith in my discerning eye. It is second to none.
我不予否定，但是據我推測，\n這件事情也是能夠「雙贏」的。=I cannot deny your claim, but I believe this too is a win-win situation.
根據我的理解，為了更進一步的成長，\n就需要「神魂顛倒怦然心動汽水」。=To aid in your development, we will require the Head Over Heels Lovey-Dovey Lemonade.
再加上「滿滿都是愛的鬆餅」，\n我還希望能夠點上「多麼可愛的{{A}}聖代」。=I would also like the Love Stack Pancakes and the Cutie Cat Strawberry Parfait.
{{A}}，謝謝您的點單～！=Wow, thank you so much～!
對了，作為您點了這麼多菜品的謝禮……=Oh! As thanks for ordering so much...
這是可以在下次攝影會上使用的券，\n能用來跟我拍攝合照！=That's a ticket for a picture with me at my next photo session!
其實這個是只能給老顧客的……\n但大姐姐你是特別的哦！=These are usually just for regulars, \nbut you're special.
心動。=Squee!
這就是傳說中著名的合照券……\n我也能入手的時刻終於到來了嗎。=I've heard much about the fabled fan photo ticket. It is finally mine.
啊，對不起！\n稍微失陪一下。=Oops, I'm sorry! Excuse me one second.
{{A}}？是姐姐我啦。=Hello? Big Sis here.
肚子餓了嗎？對不起啊，\n冰箱裡放了我打工時候領的便當……=You're hungry? I'm sorry. Look, there's some leftover food I got from work in the fridge, okay?
啊，我居然……=Ah! That was not proper of me.
因為過於感動，變得有點漫不經心了，\n請允許我在此謝罪。=I was overcome by emotion. I apologize.
不管怎麼說……{{A}}對您來說，\n果然是很好的學習榜樣呢。=At any rate, I believe {{A}} is a truly superb role model for you.
學習{{A}}的偶像舉止，\n可以幫助您有所成長，因此……=In order to best aid your personal growth by learning the ways of the idol...
我們需要去參加攝影會。=We must attend this photo session.
只是{{A}}自己想去吧……？=You just want to go
我可能確實有點興趣=I am a little curious
r:"^下次希望您把具有<color\=#ff0000>布芙達因</color>的\n<color\=#ff0000>{{A}}</color>拿過來。$"="Next, I request a <color\=#ff0000>{{A}}</color> with <color\=#ff0000>Bufudyne</color>."
讓您久等了～\n您點的汽水、鬆餅、聖代。=Thanks for waiting～! Here's your lemonade, pancakes, and parfait.
……似乎點的有點多了，\n希望您也幫忙一起食用。=...It would seem I have ordered too much. Please help me finish this food.
看來{{A}}無論如何都想去參加攝影會……={{A}} seems dead set on this photo session...
等想去的時候，就推進特別計畫，\n再陪陪{{A}}吧。=If I want to, I can keep fulfilling her requests and accompany her.

Rank 13
您還記得上次的約定嗎？=Do you recall our earlier promise?
……攝影會？=...The photo session?
我不允許您說忘記了哦。\n是{{A}}的攝影會。=Please do not feign forgetfulness. Naturally, I am referring to {{A}}'s photo session.
您記得真清楚。\n沒錯，就是這個攝影會。=Indeed. I am glad that you remember.
店內正在舉辦{{A}}的攝影會……={{A}}'s shoot is taking place in this shop...
拍攝合照的時候，\n既要讓畫面具有衝擊感……=A photo with one's idol is a momentous occasion. It requires due diligence.
又要考慮到不給偶像造成太大的負擔，\n我想這是需要有想像力的。=It is vital that one make an effort to avoid needlessly burdening their idol.
據我事先調查，對話前應該先準備一些問題，\n需是既能讓偶像準確回答，又適合發散話題。=According to my research, it is helpful to prepare concise questions that they can build upon.
攝影會的時間是有限的，\n所以必須在規定的時間內結束對話。=Time is limited after all, and our discussion must conclude in a proper fashion.
難度相當高啊=Sounds complicated
加油吧=Let's do our best
我期待著你的本領=You take the lead
正是如此，正如偶像有著不成文的規則，\n粉絲也有理應遵守的規矩。=Indeed. Just as idols have tacit restrictions, fans must follow their own code of conduct as well.
當然了。就像偶像需要練習一樣，\n粉絲也必須努力。=Of course. Just as idols work to hone their skills, fans should put forth an effort as well.
請您放心交給我。作為{{A}}的粉絲，\n我的預先準備堪稱完美。=You may leave it to me. As {{A}}'s fan, I have prepared well in advance.
……我理解，\n偶像和粉絲的關係是特別的。=...It is fascinating how idols and fans share such a special connection.
不管是從偶像身上，還是從粉絲身上。\n我還有很多需要學習的東西。=There is much to learn from them both.
工作人員=Staff
有請下一位～！=Next in line please～!
終於輪到我了嗎……\n我會讓您見識一下何謂滿分的攝影會表現。=At last. Allow me to demonstrate to you a\nflawless fan meeting interaction.
注意時間限制=<size\=30>Watch your time carefully</size>
嚴格遵守規則=Don't get kicked out
萬無一失，請您放心。=Naturally, I am prepared for all possibilities.
{{A}}的手裡，\n握著大量的合照券……={{A}} is holding a fat stack of tickets...
為了更深入地了解偶像，\n在與您一起的日子之外我也有頻繁拜訪。=To deepen my understanding of idols, I have taken the liberty to visit the café in my own time.
那麼，我去去就回。\n希望您仔細地觀看我與{{A}}的交流。=Come. I ask that you observe my conversation with {{A}}.
啊，是{{A}}！\n謝謝你過來～=Ah, {{A}}! Thanks so much for coming～!
我當然會過來了。\n因為我單推{{A}}。=Why, I would not dare miss it. After all, you are my one and only, {{A}}.
謝謝！\n不過，能夠像這樣見面，我果然更開心呢。=Thanks! I'm really glad to see you.
……我徹底調查過了，\n{{A}}喜歡的食物是布丁，沒錯吧。=...{{A}}. I read that your favorite food is pudding. Is that true?
嗯，我最喜歡布丁了哦！=Yes, I love pudding!
是嗎……=I see...
{{A}}？怎麼啦？={{A}}? What's wrong?
啊，沒事……\n今日天氣也晴朗宜人……=Ah, it is nothing... Such lovely weather we are having...
{{B}}，那是什麼意思啦？\n{{A}}總是這麼有意思呢～={{B}}! Where'd that come from? You're always so funny, {{A}}～!
{{A}}完全沒能活用，\n剛才展現的淵博知識……=All that knowledge she demonstrated a second ago flew out the window...
看來是面對自己的推，有點太激動了……=Merope looks like she's on cloud nine...
麻煩的粉絲=Troublesome Fan
慢死了！別因為是個女的，\n就對她特別照顧啊！=Hurry it up! Don't just favor the women!
時間早就過了吧！滾下去！=Her time is way up! Send her packin'!
她交了很多券=She has lots of tickets
時間應該還足夠=<size\=28>She has plenty of time left</size>
切……動作快點啊。=Tch... Hurry it up!
……失禮了。我理解，\n讓後面的粉絲等待是違反禮儀的。=...Forgive me. I am aware that to make other fans wait is a breach of etiquette.
啊……對不起哦……\n難得你準備了這麼多的合照券。=...I'm so sorry. You even saved up all these tickets.
沒關係。\n比起這個，我更希望能跟{{A}}合照。=I do not mind. More importantly, I'd like a photo with you, {{A}}.
……嗯！讓他們幫我們拍得可愛一點吧。=...Of course! Let's take a cute one!
……這就是傳說中的合影照片。\n真是令人感慨萬千。=...So this is how it feels to take a photo with your idol. I am remarkably moved.
雖然發生了一點小意外，但{{A}}看起來滿心歡喜的樣子……=Despite the mishap, {{A}} looks thrilled...
……所以說啊，從{{A}}身上，\n感覺不到幹勁啊！=...This is why I can't get hyped for you, {{A}}!
站在粉絲的角度，\n我希望你更加拼命地努力啊！=As a fan, I expect to see more of a serious effort from you!
唔、嗯……對不起哦……=R-Right... Um, sorry.
你看看你！這種時候也是，\n搞不懂你是被動，還是不夠熱情。=And don't be so mousy either! \nIt's like you have no passion!
你得自己主動來釣粉絲！\n光是傻站著可紅不起來啊！=You gotta reel fans in! You'll never rise to stardom just waiting around!
……說的是呢，的確是這樣。\n嗯，今後我會更加努力的！=...Yes, you're absolutely right. I'll try much harder from now on!
這就對了，你明白就好。\n還有啊，你其他的問題……=Exactly. Glad you understand. \nWhile we're at it, another thing...
……即使面對這樣蠻不講理的發言，\n也能用笑容應對的包容力，值得讚賞。=...Her ability to tolerate such unreasonable demands and still keep a smile is commendable.
但是，就算是我，聽到有人如此貶低{{A}}，\n也已經到了忍耐的極限。=However, I can only bear to watch for so long.
到此為止了，粗暴的傢伙。=That is enough, ruffian.
{{A}}？搞什麼啊，別妨礙我！\n現在輪到我了啊！=Huh? What's your problem! \nGet lost! It's my turn now!
您這惡劣的行徑，堪稱粉絲中的敗類，\n我已經無法再置之不理了。=I can no longer ignore your misconduct.\nIt brings shame to all of us fans.
您沒有資格稱自己推{{A}}。\n麻煩您回去吧。=You have no right to call yourself a fan of {{A}}. I ask that you leave.
別、別開玩笑了！你才該哪涼快哪待著去！=Screw that! It's you who's gotta go!
這次是要幹什麼啊？\n一個接一個的，別太過分了啊！=Now what!? You people need to get your shit together!
男性粉絲=Male Fan
你才是不要太過分！=No, YOU do!
女性粉絲=Female Fan
有錯的人是你吧！\n總是對{{A}}說那麼過分的話！=You're the problem! You're always so mean to {{A}}!
老顧客粉絲=Regular Fan
合影的時候也是，\n你才是超時最嚴重的那個！=You go overtime more than anyone else!
你還敢繼續欺負{{A}}的話，\n我們也不會坐視不理的！=Bully {{A}} again and you'll have to deal with us!
搞、搞什麼啊……可惡！=What the hell!? Shit!
果然，{{A}}的真推就該這麼做。\n請允許我向各位致謝。=Thank you, everyone. This is how true {{A}} fans should be.
小姐姐你才是，好帥氣啊！\n還有，那邊的小哥也是！=You two were awesome!
雖然我們也對那個人很頭疼，\n但沒有勇氣像你這樣說出來……=That guy annoyed us, but we were too afraid to stand up to him...
因為那傢伙願意花錢，\n所以工作人員也沒有阻止他……=The staff wouldn't do anything about him since he's a paying customer...
各位……給大家添麻煩了，對不起！\n不過，謝謝大家為我擔心！=Everyone... I'm sorry for the trouble, \nbut thank you for looking out for me!
粉絲們=Fans
成·瑠·瑠！成·瑠·瑠～！=NA-RU-RU! NA-RU-RU～!
也謝謝{{A}}和小帥哥幫助我！=And thank you both for coming to my rescue!
不必在意。\n那人過於無禮，作為粉絲，我無法置之不理。=Think nothing of it. As your fan, I refuse to tolerate such behavior.
{{A}}看起來很自豪的樣子……={{A}} looks proud...
雖然發生了意料之外的事情，但首次攝影會，\n的確讓我體驗到了非同尋常的意義。=All things considered, our first photo session has been most rewarding.
關於您所提供的幫助，\n也請允許我向您表達感謝。=I am grateful for your assistance today.
話先說到這裡，\n請允許我繼續推進特別計畫。=Now, let us proceed with the next phase of our special contract.
r:"^下次希望您把具有<color\=#ff0000>吸魔</color>的\n<color\=#ff0000>{{A}}</color>拿過來。$"="Next, I request a <color\=#ff0000>{{A}}</color> with <color\=#ff0000>Spirit Drain</color>."
這次就在此解散吧，\n還請您繼續多多關照。=Let us part ways for today. \nI appreciate your continued cooperation.

Rank 15
r:"^那麼，(.*)大人，\n今天也請您允許我帶您奔赴我們的聖地。$"="$1-sama, I would like us to pay another visit to the land of idols."
聖地？=Land of idols?
{{A}}在等我們=Our {{A}} awaits
希望您不要裝傻，\n這當然是指{{A}}所在的那家店。=Do not feign ignorance. I refer to {{A}}'s place of employment.
r:"^不愧是(.*)大人。\n您現在完全是了不起的(.*)推了。$"="Excellent, $1-sama. I see you too have become a fine $2 fan."
正在接客的偶像=Working Idol
歡迎光臨～\n啊，是{{A}}和小帥哥！=Welcome～ Ah, it's {{A}} and her friend!
失禮了，{{A}}在哪裡？據我所知，\n今天這個時間，應該會有她的排班。=Pardon me, where is {{A}}? \nI believe her shift is today.
對不起，{{A}}有點事情，\n說要晚點來店裡。=I'm sorry. {{A}} said she'll be a bit late.
我估計應該馬上就要來了……\n您這邊打算怎麼辦？要改天再來嗎？=She should be here soon. \nWould you like to come back later?
既然如此，請允許我在店裡等她。=No, that is fine. We will wait inside.
我知道了。\n那麼，我帶你們去座位上。=Understood! Right this way.
{{A}}，小帥哥！\n對不起啊，前一個打工有點晚了……=Hi, you two! I'm so sorry! \nMy other job ran too long.
完全沒關係。=It was no trouble at all.
不過……除了這裡，您還在別處打工？\n而且，您看起來有點疲憊……=But I am surprised to hear that you are working two jobs. You appear to be rather fatigued.
{{B}}……什麼都逃不過{{A}}的眼睛呢。\n真是瞞不住你呀。={{B}}... I can't hide anything from you, {{A}}.
……粉絲嚴禁擅自觸及偶像的隱私，\n我理解這點。=...I am well aware that prying into an idol's personal life is taboo.
但是，\n我只是單純地在擔心{{A}}。=However, I am worried for you, {{A}}.
您意下如何？\n如果方便的話，您願意說明一下情況嗎？=If you do not mind, might I inquire about your situation?
……謝謝你，{{A}}。\n你願意稍微聽我說說嗎？=...Thank you, {{A}}. \nI don't mind telling you.
其實我家並不是很富裕……\n老實說，是相當窮啦……=The truth is, my family isn't very well-off.\nHonestly, we're flat broke...
所以我必須得打工，\n來維持家裡的生計。=That's why I need to work to support us all.
我最開始在這裡打工，\n也是因為聽說很賺錢……=At first, I applied to this café because I heard the pay was good...
不過啊，在打工當偶像這個過程裡，\n我逐漸覺得還挺樂在其中的。=As I kept at it though, I started to enjoy being an idol.
不僅僅是為了賺錢，而是因為，\n看到客人為我開心，我也覺得高興……=I love making our guests happy. \nIt isn't just about the money...
透過喜歡著我的大家，\n我感覺自己也能喜歡自己了。=Everyone's support for me as an idol has taught me to love myself more.
可是，光靠這裡的收入是不夠的……\n所以，我還同時在其它地方打工。=But my family can't live on this pay alone,\nso I have to work multiple jobs.
原來有著這樣的內情啊=I had no idea
真不容易啊……=That's rough...
嗯……\n其實我不太想把這種事情說出來。=To be honest, this is hard for me to admit.
粉絲們要是因為同情才來推我的話，\n我總覺得這樣也不對。=It doesn't feel right to beg my fans for sympathy.
……嗯。因為我的妹妹還很小，\n所以我感覺自己必須努力。=...Yeah, it is. My sister is still young, \nso I have to do my best for her.
……謝謝。\n也不是什麼了不起的事啦。=...Thank you, but it's nothing that impressive.
不過比起被同情，\n這樣我會開心很多。=Still, I'll take that over pity any day.
啊，你們不要誤會哦！\n我不是希望你們勉強自己給我花錢啦！=Oh, don't misunderstand though. I don't want you to spend more money on me or anything!
當然，就是因為各位粉絲願意花錢，\n偶像才得以存在……=I know idols rely on their fans' financial support, but...
但如果不能讓大家開心的話，\n那就不能自稱為偶像了！=If you're spending out of pity and not enjoying yourselves, then I can't call myself an idol!
……雖然清貧但卻高潔的精神，\n實在是太美妙了。=...Your dignity in the face of such hardship is\nadmirable.
果然{{A}}是不會辜負我期望的偶像。={{A}}, you really are my one true idol.
{{B}}，也謝謝{{A}}的誇獎。={{B}}. Thank you, {{A}}.
……不過，\n我可能無法繼續這份工作了。=...Unfortunately, I don't think I'll be able to keep working here much longer.
加上他們好像還在計畫什麼糟糕的活動……=There's this awful event they're planning...
{{A}}，這究竟是……=What kind of event, {{A}}...
啊，製作人……！=Ah, Producer...!
店裡的製作人=Store Producer
{{A}}～！\n給那邊的客人上蛋包飯～！拜託～！={{A}}～! One omelette rice for this table, thank you!
好、好的。我這就去！=Uh, yes, coming!
對不起，今天來了很多客人。=I'm sorry, we're really busy today.
我得把遲到的份給補回來。\n那麼，請各位自便啦！=I've got to work even harder since I came in late. I hope you enjoy yourselves!
{{A}}～你給一組的客人花太多時間了。\n做事必須更有效率，懂？={{A}}～ That's too much time at one table.\nYou gotta multitask better, 'kay?
……好的，我會注意的。=...Yes, I'll be more careful.
……外面好像也在排隊了。\n據我理解，粉絲也需要有互幫互讓的精神。=...There is a line outside. As fellow fans, we must be considerate.
今天先離開店裡吧。=Let us leave for today.
唔？那副打扮，是{{A}}店裡的……=Those must be {{A}}'s coworkers...
懶洋洋的店員=Lethargic Employee
休息時間差不多要結束了哦～\n得回去店裡了。=Break's over. Guess we should head back.
說話刻薄的店員=Foulmouthed Employee
{{A}}，真不想回去啊～\n反正薪水也沒多少……=Ugh, I don't wanna! The pay sucks ass.
那個P，好過分啊。\n我們的獎金，幾乎都被他從薪水裡扣掉了！=The producer is such a jerk. \nHe still hasn't given us our back pay!
算啦，\n我們是隨便幹幹的，說得過去就行。=If it was just us, I could deal. \nWe barely try anyway.
像{{A}}，明明那麼認真地工作，\n賺的錢卻幾乎都被P拿走了哦！=But {{A}}'s busting her ass, \nand he still keeps most of her paycheck.
失禮了，可以稍微打擾下嗎？=Excuse me. May I have a moment?
{{B}}？你……你們是推{{A}}的！={{B}}? Oh, you're {{A}}'s fans!
糟糕。\n剛才說的話被你們聽見了？=Crap, did you just hear all that?
剛才的話……希望您能詳細說來聽聽。=Please, tell us more.
當然，我們不會告訴任何人，\n是從你們這裡聽到的。=We promise to keep it to ourselves, of course.
……就跟我們說的一樣。\n我們店裡的Ｐ……啊，就是指製作人啦。=...Like we were saying, the problem is our café's producer.
那傢伙，把我們在店裡賺的錢，\n幾乎都拿走了。=The dude takes pretty much everything we earn.
……您是說，\n他沒有支付給各位偶像們應有的酬勞？=...You mean he is not compensating you idols fairly?
沒錯。概念咖的價格，\n明顯比一般的飲食店要高吧？=Yep. Con cafés are way more expensive than most places, right?
就是說，\n費用裡面包含了我們接客的服務費……=That's because there's a fee for our services included in the price...
這種叫作獎金，\n一般都會算作基本薪水之外的追加。=That money would normally be included in our wages.
可是，在我們店裡，\n連這些獎金也幾乎都被Ｐ拿走了。=But at our shop the producer takes most of it for himself.
看來有問題啊=Sounds problematic
不去告這家店嗎？=Can you sue?
{{A}}？哎呀～我們也搞不懂這種複雜的事情……={{A}}? Beats me... We're clueless about all that complicated stuff.
……據我了解，概念咖的話，\n獎金很大程度上可以由店裡自行定奪。=...For con cafés, I believe that kind of extra pay is largely at the discretion of the shop.
也就是說，只要支付了基本薪水，\n大多數情況下，在法律上是沒有問題的。=In short, as long as workers are paid the minimum wage set by law, there is no grounds for legal recourse in most cases.
雖然不是很明白，但是好厲害啊！\n小姐姐，你好懂啊～=I don't really get it, but wow! \nYou really know a lot～
關於偶像和概念咖，我做了徹底的調查。=I am well-versed in idol culture and con cafés.
好啦，總之從打工仔的角度來看，\n我們的店可真是太黑啦。=Anyway, that's why our management is the absolute worst.
而且，聽說最近好像……\n還要搞一些特別噁心的活動。=Plus, there's this super messed up event happening soon.
噁心的活動，是指？=Could you elaborate?
活動名是叫「拯救我推」對吧？\n說是不達成營業額目標，就要被強制畢業。=It's called "Save Your Fave." Basically, any idols that don't hit their sales quota will be fired.
你們可別到處說，那個活動，\n是把感覺最近要辭職的女孩子們聚到一起……=Don't tell anyone, but it's meant to weed out the girls likely to quit soon...
……{{A}}好像也在名單上。=...and {{A}} is one of them.
為什麼她會？=Why her?
{{A}}要辭職？={{A}} might quit?
{{A}}不是同時在打幾份工嘛？\n所以搞到今天也遲到了。={{A}}'s working another job, right?\nThat's why she was late today.
因為這個她之前好像跟Ｐ吵過……\nＰ要求她不要同時打幾份工，專心在店裡幹。=And the producer has yelled at her before to quit the other job to focus on this one.
可就像剛才說的，\n在我們店裡，無論怎麼幹都賺不到錢。=But there's no way she can do that because no matter how many hours she puts in here, she still won't make much.
{{A}}家裡很困難啊……\n她說就算是為了自己的小妹，也需要賺錢。={{A}}'s family has it rough. And she has to work to support her little sister.
雖然{{A}}自己，\n看起來是想要繼續當偶像……=I think {{A}} wants to continue working as an idol...
但她為了家裡吃飯，\n可能不得不辭掉我們店的工作啦。=But she said she'll probably have to quit this job so she can make enough money for her family.
……得知此事的Ｐ，\n就讓{{A}}參加強制畢業活動？=And the producer, fully aware of this, \nintends to force {{A}} out at this event?
辦成了自然賺錢。就算失敗，在店裡看來，\n反正不過是馬上要辭職的女孩子消失了而已。=Either she succeeds and he profits, or he loses someone who planned to quit anyway.
還能趕最後再從粉絲那裡撈一筆。\n怎麼樣，是不是有夠噁心啊？=On top of that, the event's gonna bleed the fans dry. Messed up, right?
雖然我們這次還沒事，\n但老實說不知道什麼時候就會被逼參加……=The two of us are safe for now, but I wouldn't be surprised if we're next...
與其要當眾出洋相，\n那我就先炒掉他啦，真是個破店！=Screw that! If I'm gonna be put on display like some prize cow, then I'm quittin' too!
{{A}}的兩名同事回去店裡了……={{A}}'s coworkers returned\nto the café...
……我現在感受到了強烈的{{A}}。=...Please be aware that I am overcome with blind rage.
不但剝削{{A}}那樣敬業的偶像，\n甚至還要剝奪她的夢想……！=How dare that vile man exploit a precious idol like {{A}} and try to steal her dreams away...!
想辦法整治一下缺德Ｐ吧=<size\=28>We'll make that villain pay</size>
去幫幫{{A}}吧！=Let's help {{A}}!
不愧是您。\n我就在等您這句話。=Yes. Those are the words I was waiting for.
……我有一個想法。=If I may offer a suggestion...
既然如此隨心所欲地作惡，\n那麼{{A}}裡極有可能存在Ｐ的陰影。=Considering the magnitude of his heinous deeds, it is likely that this producer has a Shadow in {{A}}.
那麼，您就可以\n如您至今為止所做的那樣……=Therefore, just as you have done up until now...
或許可以讓缺德的Ｐ{{A}}。=I believe you can make that corrupt producer have a change of heart.
r:"^(.*)大人……\n希望您務必接受這份來自我的委託。$"="$1-sama... I implore you.\nPlease accept my request."
……感謝您的關懷。=...I appreciate your kindness in this matter.
我為{{A}}的奮戰祈禱。=I wish you and the {{A}} the best of luck.

Mementos Request

那我們趕緊走吧，\n今天要去橫濱哦。=Great! Let's head over right away! \nToday we're headin' for Yokohama.
是嗎……那麼，\n我會等你方便的時候再說。=Oh, okay... In that case, \nlet's pick a time when we're all free.
那今天就讓我品嘗一下，\n{{A}}推薦的中國的茶。=I am quite looking forward to trying your Chinese tea recommendations, {{A}}.
我可是做足了準備的，所以敬請期待。\n……啊，是這邊。=I'd hope so! I've prepared only the best for you, Yukimi-san. Ah, over here!
我拜託了這家店的老闆，\n今天是特別菜單。=Today's a special menu I personally asked the owner to prepare.
首先是這邊的中國的茶和……=First we have this Chinese tea, aaand...
日本的羊羹。=This Japanese sweet bean jelly to go with.
……茶水的顏色是淡淡的黃色。\n香氣很獨特呢。=The tea is a faint yellow... \nwith a unique aroma.
請搭配這邊的茶一起嘗嘗。\n為了防止茶泡太久，我趕緊倒出來了哦。=Please, try it with this tea too. Let me pour it now so the flavor doesn't get too strong.
這次是明亮的褐色……準確說，是淺紅色嗎？\n……嗯，不管哪種都很好喝。=This deep indigo color... Or perhaps it is more of a light crimson? Both are exquisite.
開始的茶是在中國比較少見的黃茶……=The first tea is huangcha. \nA yellow tea, rare even in China.
後面是人們常喝的普洱，\n但是在清茶的時候就倒出來了。=The second is a diluted pot of pu'er.\nA fermented tea you can find anywhere.
比起濃茶，這樣應該會更配羊羹。=Softening the flavor helps it pair better with the sweet bean jelly.
最後是這個～用糖漿和白砂糖做中國點心，\n叫冰糖蓮子，以及……=And lastly, we have lotus seed soup. A Chinese sweet made with powdered sugar and corn syrup...
日本的煎茶。=Accompanied by Japanese sencha green tea.
我覺得冰糖蓮子，\n和日本的糖納豆很相似。=I think you might find this dessert similar to simmered Japanese red beans.
雖然日式點心不會使用蓮子，\n但是在中國的點心裡，還是挺常見的。=I know you don't see lotus seeds used in Japanese sweets very often, but they're used as a paste in Chinese sweets regularly.
它不會有豆子的那種特殊的味道，\n跟日本茶很配哦。=They're milder than beans, \nso they suit Japanese tea quite well.
中國的茶文化，\n根據地域的不同，多種多樣。=The rich history of Chinese tea varies greatly by region.
是互相融合才發展成了如今這樣的形式哦。=I tapped into a few of their distinctive flavor profiles to produce this meal.
所以，茶和茶點會存在無數種美味的組合，\n這是非常常見的！=Given the regional diversity, it's no surprise that there're infinite ways of pairing teas and sweets together.
至少我是這麼想的。=That's what I think, at least.
{{A}}說的可能沒錯。\n事實上，剛才的組合，無論哪種都很美味。=You may be right, {{A}}. \nEvery pairing you gave me was delicious.
可是，請回憶一下我對茶道的解釋。=Even so, please remember what I explained to you before regarding the tea ceremony.
茶道歸根結底是讓{{A}}和客人相互加深理解。=The crux of it lies in creating a deep understanding between proprietor and customer.
正是因為這樣，\n所以會存在固定的形式和禮節上的規矩。=Its established form and etiquette are all for the sake of that purpose.
在茶道中，正因為客人理解了{{A}}的意圖，\n座才會成立。=The customer is there to comprehend the intentions of the proprietor.
即使從外界的視角來看很難理解，\n但它也是這麼成立的。=This may be difficult to understand from the outside, but that is how it is.
不遵守形式和禮節規矩，即使功夫再深，\n也無法在客人和{{A}}之間達成共識。=Neither party is meant to share ideas contrary to what's been decided, no matter how respectable they might be.
所以，這不是能跟茶道比較的東西。=As such, this is not comparable to the culture of tea ceremony.
唔嗯……如果都按照茶道的標準來看的話，\n就完全沒有辦法互相理解啦……=If you value everything by tea ceremony standards, we'll never understand each other...
{{A}}一臉為難地看著這邊……={{A}} is staring at me with a look of confusion on her face...
把該說的話說出來吧=<size\=27>Say what needs to be said</size>
解釋清楚吧=<size\=26>You have to explain yourself</size>
說出真心話吧！=<size\=28>Hit her with your feelings!</size>
說的對。\n在這裡退縮的話，努力就白費了。=Yeah, you're right. \nNo point in any of this if I back down now.
聽了{{A}}的感想，\n我有問題想問你。=You know, {{A}}, there's something I've gotta ask after hearing you say that.
對{{A}}來說，\n茶道是你自己發自內心認可的價值觀嗎？=Do the beliefs you have about tea ceremony reflect your own personal feelings?
還是說，因為有人對你說「這是好的」，\n所以你才接受了它呢？=Or are they just something somebody told you was proper?
雖然常說中華料理有幾千年的歷史……=People often talk about the millennia of history behind Chinese cuisine.
但是辣椒傳入四川，\n不過就是５００年前的事情。=But you know, chilis didn't come to Sichuan until about 500 years ago.
如果５００年前的人判定，\n辣椒不屬於四川調料……=If people back then had decided that chilis weren't a proper Sichuan seasoning, well...
那麼也不會存在麻婆豆腐這樣的名菜了。=Mapo tofu wouldn't exist anywhere in the world.
就算茶道重視的思考方式是不可動搖的現實。=Even if you want to hold the tea ceremony in high regard, that's an unshakable reality.
但什麼才是真正重要的，\n不親自去嘗試肯定是不會明白的。=It's hard to say if something's actually valuable unless you assess it for yourself.
別人{{A}}的抉擇，對自己來說是否適用，\n這個別人也無法做出判斷！=Personally, I have no idea if other people's "right ideas" are right for me!
因為，能夠決定這一點的，\n只有自己！=I mean, the only person who can decide what's right for me is me!
說、說了很多……對不起。=Ah, um... Sorry. I just can't stop talking, huh?
可是我，覺得{{A}}，\n是個非常溫柔的人……=It's just, I think you're the nicest person in the whole wide world, {{A}}...
你既有著想做的事情，\n又想要實現的目標，所以，既然這樣……=And I know there's something you really want to do with your life. So...

哎呀，男爵你別當真啦，當然是開玩笑的？\n我可不會做那種粗魯的事。=Oh my goodness! Russet, don't take it seriously, it's a joke! I wouldn't do something that rough.
真要做的話，\n也得在現實中幹才有意義～=If I were to do it, it'd have to be in real life to mean anything～
這可就麻煩了呢！\n就算人少，這裡也是重要的地方。=That'd be troublesome! Even if few people are there, it's an important place.
沒辦法……那至少，\n把那棟樓的土地整個買下來好了。=Fine... then at least, I'll buy the land under that building.
要是是自己的地，炸掉也沒關係吧？=If it's my land, blowing it up should be fine, right?
算啦算啦，\n現在還是好好享受新區域吧。=Never mind, let's just enjoy the new area for now.
對了，男爵你不是跟{{A}}一起，\n去過{{B}}的地下商場嗎？=By the way, didn't you go to the {{B}} underground mall with {{A}} before, Russet?
這邊也有地下商場嗎？\n我對一些店鋪很好奇呢。=Is there an underground mall here too? I'm curious about some shops.
對了，那邊的花店怎麼樣？\n……{{A}}～突然開始在意起來了！=Hey, what about that flower shop? ...{{A}}～ Now I'm getting curious!
來吧男爵！我們現在去親自看看吧！=Come on, Russet! \nLet's go check it out ourselves!
新區域真是讓人興奮！\n那麼，我們今天去哪玩好呢？=The new area is so exciting! So, where should we explore today?

之前去過的荻窪的那家店，\n我發現了些讓我在意的東西……=There's something at that spot in Ogikubo from before that's caught my eye.
哦，東西還在。\n那我們走吧。=Nice. They still have what I'm looking for. Let's go.
這樣啊……\n那就下次吧。=No worries... \nWell, next time then.
這家店，店主偶爾會心血來潮，\n推出一些限定的拉麵。=This place sometimes offers a special ramen for a limited time only.
當天才會告知，在當天限量供應，\n所以競爭很激烈呢。=It's announced the day of, and they only make so many bowls, so it's hard to get.
碰巧今天舉辦限定活動，\n備料也還有剩，說明我們有食運哦。=They just happened to be doin' it today,\nso it looks like we're in luck.
……來了哦，是咖哩拉麵的套餐。=...And here it is. The curry ramen set meal.
據說是參考了新瀉很常見的拉麵……\n就是所謂的本地拉麵。=It's a popular kind of ramen in Niigata. That must be where they got the inspo for this.
還有米飯和福神漬。\n不愧是「套餐」，感覺非常划算。=Look, it comes with rice and pickled veggies too. What a great deal.
拉麵上澆咖哩……=<size\=30>Curry and ramen, huh...</size>
沒見過的拉麵=<size\=27>I've never seen this before</size>
吃得完嗎……=<size\=30>Can we finish all this...</size>
咖哩烏龍麵還挺常見的吧，\n這個看起來應該也挺配，但還真新奇啊。=I mean, curry udon is a thing, so it's not as unusual as it is rare.
嗯，我也是第一次在吃。=Me neither. I've never had it at a restaurant before.
確實，相當大的量啊。\n幸好現在肚子也餓了。=Good point. It is a lot of food... You did say you were hungry, though!
不過，畢竟是咖哩味的，肯定不會難吃吧。\n{{A}}。=Plus it's gonna taste like curry, so I'm sure it won't disappoint. Let's dig in.
……啊，吃得太猛的話，會弄髒衣服哦。=Oh, right! Don't slurp too fast or you'll get covered in curry.
和想像中的咖哩味的拉麵……=When it comes to what I imagined curry ramen to be...
完全不一樣！=This is anythin' but!
原以為只是在醬油拉麵上，\n澆上咖哩。=They used the soup from the shoyu ramen we had before to thin out the curry.
但如果是這樣，湯與芡的調和是怎麼回事？\n從咖哩醬開始就必須自己做，否則實現不了！=What do you think of the harmony of the broth and noodle thickness? They must make the roux from scratch!
問得好唐突……=That's very sudden...
我大概是知道的=Probably
就是咖哩醬的製作方法啦。\n……{{A}}，一般用的是市場上賣的成品嗎。=How to make a curry roux from scratch. Most people use store-bought products, yeah?
抱、抱歉。\n我一想入神就會忽略周圍。=Oh, sorry. When I get absorbed in something, I forget what's goin' on around me.
{{A}}，對了，\n是在說咖哩醬。=Oh, right. I was talkin' about curry roux, wasn't I?
這樣啊，那就容易溝通了……\n{{A}}，怎麼可能呢！=Oh yeah? No problem then. \nIf you're PSYCHIC.
不，是在說咖哩醬啦。=But we're talkin' about how to make a curry roux here.
製作咖哩醬是非常花費工夫、消耗精神的。\n要用奶油慢慢地炒麵粉，得注意不能炒焦……=Making one takes lot of time and effort. You gotta fry the flour in butter slowly, so it doesn't burn.
同時還要顧及普通料理的準備工作吧？\n這裡的老闆，到底幾點才睡啊？=I bet this place prepares the regular menu at the same time. When does the chef find time to sleep?
吃飽了，該回去了。=What a feast that was. \nLet's get outta here.
……本該是這麼想的。\n但其實這份套餐還有後續，真是讓人佩服啊。=Oh... right. It's crazy to think that there's even more where that came from.
把這個倒進湯裡，浸透。咖哩配麵也不錯，\n但看到咖哩會更自然地想配米飯吧。=Put this in too. Noodles are good and all, but with curry you gotta have rice as well.
果然很經典啊……！\n有咖哩的話，就會想吃米飯。=Well, that hit the spot! Curry is way, way better with a side of rice.
店方就是懂這一點，\n才做成「套餐」的吧。=I guess the chef knows that as well and that's why they made it into a set meal.
啊～吃飽了。\n超有滿足感，多謝款待。=Ahhh～ I'm stuffed! \nhat a satisfyin' meal that was.
味道當然很好，不過不惜下這麼多功夫，\n也要讓顧客一直享受到最後的決心……=It tasted great and all, but they really made sure that you enjoy each and every bite...
這應該是叫關心嗎……\n從這一碗裡感受到了很多……=That's customer consideration for you... \nYou get so much outta a single bowl...
關心……=Consideration...
……是我小時候的事情，\n那時跟老爸一起在家裡吃拉麵。=I remember once when I was a kid, I was havin' ramen with my dad at home...
不知怎麼的，我走神了，\n沒怎麼動筷子。=At the time, somethin' or other always had my attention, so I didn't have much of an appetite.
然後老爸突然給我的麵澆上了咖哩。=Outta nowhere, my dad poured curry into my ramen.
他是個卡車司機，平時都不在家，\n本來也是個話不多的人，所以我……=Bein' a child and all, I thought I had upset him somehow...
那時候一直以為是我惹老爸生氣了……=I mean, he was never really a talkative guy, nor was he around much at home with his job as a truck driver...
難道說，他是在新瀉吃到了這個，\n所以「想要讓我嘗嘗」嗎。=But now I think maybe he'd had it in Niigata and thought I should try it.
算了，反正現在也沒辦法確認了。\n他都已經離開家了。=Well, there's no way to know now, since he's gone.
……之前好像說過，我父母離婚了，\n我現在跟老媽一起生活。=Like I said before, my parents are divorced and I now live with my mom.
我想開拉麵店，\n也是因為想趕緊獨立，減輕老媽的負擔……=I wanna open a ramen shop, but I also want to make my mom's life easier...
{{A}}，抱歉。\n這些話跟尋找理想的味道完全沒關係吧。=Sorry. I know this has nothing to do with our search for my ideal flavors.

……聽你這麼一說，感覺有點難為情啊。=Quit bein' all weird and pointin' it out like that, man, haha.
糟糕，咖哩沾到褲子上了！\n要是被發現了，會被老媽罵的……！=Dang it, I got curry on my pants! My mom will have my head if she sees it!
{{A}}慌慌張張地找紙巾……=As {{A}} frantically searched for napkins, he taught me a recipe...

重叔！是的，我很好。\n您看起來也很有精神啊。=Shige-san! Yeah, I'm doin' good. \nYou seem pretty well yourself.

來啦來啦。\n每一粒米飯都被炒得剛剛好……=This is it. It's like every grain of rice has been cooked to perfection.
想到{{A}}的炒飯，\n就該是這種大顆粒的質感啊。=I love that {{A}}'s fried rice always has this great fluffiness to it.
嗯～這濕潤的感覺真是了不得。\n老闆，是不是手藝又提高了？=Mmm, I can't get enough of how spongy the rice tastes. Chef, have you improved your cooking?
那個……不好意思。\n可以讓我吃一口你的炒飯嗎？=Umm... Sorry, mind if I take a bite of that fried rice you got there?
這個勺子我沒用過……=I haven't used my spoon yet, so...
{{A}}\n倒、倒是沒問題。=Huh!? Uh, I mean I guess you can have one bite.
真的呢！\n很濕潤……=You weren't kiddin'! This really is moist...

是點的其他品種吧？=Is it a new menu item?
我也不知道。\n不過，大概……=I don't know, either. \nBut maybe...
不，並不是哪裡弄錯了。\n這大概是……=No, this is no mistake. \nBut maybe, just maybe...
不，{{A}}的炒飯只有一種。\n這大概是……=No, there is only one type of fried rice on the menu at {{A}}...
啊，那個啊……\n主要是面向常客的……=Oh, about that... \nI only really do it for regulars, but...
觀察客人的狀態，\n相應地改變調味和工序。=I observe how the person is feeling and adjust the seasoning accordingly.
阿重，你進來的時候我就發現了，\n你臉色看起來有點疲憊啊。=Shige-san looked a little tired when he came in.
我就稍微多放了一點豬油和鹽，\n所以才會比較濕潤。=So I put a bit more lard and salt in his fried rice, which is what gives it that moisture.
{{A}}\n老闆，你想得這麼周到啊。=What!? Really!? Your attention to detail is absolutely amazing, Chef.
我完全沒有發現。=I hadn't the slightest idea.
{{A}}你們的那兩碗，\n我反而少放了一些豬油。=By the way, you and your friend's servings have less lard in them, {{A}}.
你剛才說，一直在吃麵，\n想要換換心情吧？=You were saying you've been eating a lot of noodles and wanted a change of pace, right?
所以我想，你大概會想吃，\n水分比較少的大顆粒的炒飯。=So I thought you'd like to eat something light and dry with little liquid.
真的……雖然就只有一點點不一樣，\n但的確比平時的顆粒要大……=It's true. It's only a slight difference, but it seems a bit fluffier than usual...
好吃得停不下來！=I can't stop eatin' it!
不過，如果不是熟人，\n我也做不到這一點了。=Just know that I only do this for familiar faces, got it?
如果客人覺得店裡的人老是盯著自己看，\n也會感覺反感吧。=I don't want everyone thinkin' this place has some nosy creep runnin' it.

看來總算是沒有辜負{{A}}的期許，\n讓我鬆了一口氣。=I'm so relieved that I didn't end up disappointin' {{A}}.

沒有達到讓人讚不絕口的水準嗎。\n不過，謝謝你直言不諱。=Such high praise. \nThanks for being so frank with your feedback.
甚至都沒有注意到吃完了嗎。\n這比任何誇獎的話都要讓人開心啊。=You didn't even realize you finished eatin'? \nWhat better compliment is there than that?

這種東西，\n感覺不是能立刻起效的吧。=Well, this doesn't seem to have an immediate effect.
可能得持續貼一陣子，\n有一天就會出現效果。=Maybe if I keep applying it for a while, \nit will have some effect.
試試下一樣吧=Let's try the next one
就沒有別的了嗎？=Is there nothing else?
這麼說的話……\n還有些什麼東西來著？=Even if you say so...\nWhat else is there?

……擁抱。=...Hug.
擁抱的時候，腦內會分泌某種物質，\n記憶力也能得到啟動……好像是這樣的。=Apparently... Hugging secretes chemicals in the brain that also activate memory.
所以，現在和我擁抱吧。=So, give me a hug now.
這也是我一個人絕對做不到的事，\n所以是個好機會。=This is a good opportunity \nbecause I couldn't have done it alone.

像我這樣不愛和人交往的人會記住的長相，\n我覺得只可能是跟工作相關的。=I'm not good at socializing, so the only faces I can remember are those related to work.
{{A}}……要是像網購紀錄一樣，\n有之前見過面的人的長相的歷史紀錄就好了。={{A}}... I wish the faces of people I met were kept track of like an online shopping history.
沒有紀錄嗎？=No records?

是男的，這一點不會錯。\n雖然還很年輕，但看起來應該成年了。=It was a man, that's for sure. \nAlthough still young, he looked like an adult.
但如果只知道是年輕的成年男性，\n那真是要多少有多少啊……=But just knowing he's a young adult is not enough...
對了，日誌……！=Yes, the journal...!
消防隊每天的訓練，\n我都會寫下活動日誌。=As part of the fire services' daily routine, \nI always keep an activity journal.
只要重新看一遍日誌，或許就能想起來，\n當時的行人是在哪裡看到過。=If I reread that journal, maybe I'll remember where I saw that passerby.
我居然連這麼簡單的事情都沒有注意到……\n果然只有我一個人是不行的。=I can't even notice something as simple as that... \nI guess I can't do this alone.
r:"^多虧(.*)，幫大忙了。\n這麼一來，說不定就能知道些什麼。$"="$1, you saved me. Maybe this will help me understand something."
不過就算我發現了對應的人……\n也沒有任何確切的證據。=But even if we found the right person... \nWe would have no solid evidence.
最糟糕的可能是……\n這些全都是我的誤會。=At worst, it's possible that I just misunderstood everything.
如果是這樣你會怎麼做？=If so what would you do?
有沒有什麼好辦法？=Any ideas?
……監視他，如果真的是縱火犯，\n就只能在案發現場抓現行了。=...All I can do is keep an eye on him and, if he's really the arsonist, catch him at the crime scene.
但是，這完全是我自己的想法。=However, this is entirely my own idea.
如果一切都是我的誤會，\n那麼不僅是我，你也會惹上麻煩。=If this was all a misunderstanding, then not only me, but you will be in trouble too.
所以……我希望你，\n當作什麼也沒有聽到。=So... I want you... \nTo act like you never heard anything.
雖然……我會自己去監視他的。\n但你不要再跟這件事扯上任何關係了。=Of course... I'll monitor him myself. \nYou don't have to get involved in this anymore.

但……話雖如此，\n我對那個行人還是毫無頭緒。=However... I still have no idea who that passerby was.
甚至有可能，永遠也找不到線索。=There's a chance that the clues will never be found.
但是，如果我找到了線索，\n我也會把資訊共用給你……我向你保證。=But if I find it, I'll share it with you... I promise.
那麼，今天就在這裡解散吧。=Well then, that's all for today.
我會去找那時的行人……\n但……我並不是名偵探。=I will look for that passerby...\nBut I'm no great detective.

我以為是我想盡可能地減少，\n有人因為火災而失去家人的悲傷與苦痛。=I thought it was because I wanted to reduce, even just a little, the grief and pain of losing family members unfairly in a fire.
就是這樣吧？=That's it?
難道不是嗎？=Isn't it?
只有一半。=Only half.
我終於明白了，\n我內心深處的真實想法並不一樣……=I finally realized that, deep down, \nmy true feelings were different...
我真正的願望是……=My true wish is...
在火災現場幫助別人後，\n自己也能就此沉睡在火場中。=Saving someone at a fire, \nand then dying yourself.
我尋找火災現場……\n其實是在找一個可以赴死的地方。=My search for fire scenes... It was actually me searching for a place to die.
追蹤縱火犯也是因為，\n那是最可能遭遇到火災現場的途徑……=I was chasing arsonists because that gave me the highest chance of encountering fire scenes...
我以前一直都不太確定，\n現在意識到這一點，感覺一切都變得通透了。=I wasn't sure myself, but once I realized that, it all made sense.
為什麼要這麼想……！？=Why would you think that...!?
我理解不了=I don't understand
……你有聽說過，倖存者內疚嗎？=...Have you ever heard of survivor's guilt?
所謂倖存者內疚，\n就是在事故或災害中生還的人……=Survivor guilt's is when someone survives an accident or disaster...
會因為周圍的人都離去，\n自己卻獲救了，而感到罪惡感。=And then feels guilty about being the only one who survived while the others died.
……我，正是如此。=...That's exactly what happened to me too.
母親和弟弟去世，只有我自己活下來了……\n這種罪惡感一直籠罩著我。=I've always felt guilty... That my mother and brother died and I was the only one left alive.
雖然父親有安慰過我，\n說著就算只有我活了下來，他也很高興……=Of course, my father told me he was glad I at least survived... But...
……但我父親他，也是名消防員。=...My father, was also a firefighter.
當我們家起火的時候，他正在另一處現場……\n所以他沒能趕回來。=When our house caught fire, he was at another fire scene... And he couldn't make it in time.
那以後，父親為了照顧我，\n辭去了消防員的工作，改行做了其他事情。=Then, my father left the fire service and took another job to raise me on his own.
他曾經對消防員這個工作是那麼的自豪，\n還經常和我，還有我弟弟，談起工作的事……=He took such pride in being a firefighter, that he'd often tell me and my brother stories about his work...
……如果那個時候我也離開了，\n也許父親他就不會辭去消防員的工作了。=...If I'd died back then too, my father wouldn't have had to quit being a firefighter.
不是這樣的！=That's not true!
為什麼會這麼想？=Why think like that?
其實，我知道，道理我都明白，\n但這份罪惡感卻總是揮之不去……=<size\=29>In fact, I know, it's none other than myself who thinks this way. Even if logic understands, \nthe guilt won't fade...</size>
這樣的情感，直到我長大了，\n直到現在，也沒有消失。=Even now, as an adult, \nthose feelings still persist.
也許，我在有意無意間，\n一直在尋找著能夠解脫的辦法。=I've always been searching for a way to free myself from it, maybe unconsciously.
而我找到的答案就是……成為一名消防員，\n然後在火災現場結束我的生命。=And the answer was... To become a firefighter and die at a fire scene.
那個時候，我沒能同母親和弟弟一起離開。=At that time, I was unable to die with my mother and brother.
才導致了父親不得不辭去消防員的工作。=Because of that, my father had to quit being a firefighter.
所以……至少，我要成為一名消防員，\n連著我父親的份一起幫助他人……=At the very least... I'll become a firefighter myself to save people in my father's stead...
……然後，再死去。=...And then, die.
這樣，絕對是錯誤的！=This is absolutely wrong!
這樣，有誰會高興嗎？=Who would be happy?
我知道。但，我控制不了我自己！\n另一個我，一直在我耳邊低語……=I know. But I can't!\nThe other me keeps whispering in my ear...
一直在說，\n「你為什麼還能厚顏無恥地活著呢？」！！=She keeps saying, \n"Why do you still have the audacity to live?"!!
冷靜下來！=Calm down!
……真的很對不起。\n讓你看到我失態的樣子。=...I'm really sorry. You had to see me fall apart.
竟然抱著比我還小的孩子哭……\n剛才真是另一種意義的死了。=Clinging at someone younger and crying like that... Now I want to die in a different way.
都說了不要死=I said no dying
這笑話可不好笑=That's not funny
我死也不會讓你死=I won't let you die
真是的，你這人……\n不，正因為你是這樣的人，我才會……=You really are...\nNo, because of you, I...
……雖然都已經說到這個地步了，\n但我還是想問，為什麼你會對我這麼上心？=...Even after hearing all this, \nwhy do you still care about me?
儘管有很多事情算是機緣巧合……\n可你應該沒有理由做到這個地步。=Even if circumstances piled up this way... \nThere was no reason for you to go this far.

……身為大人，這時候應該敷衍一下，\n或是開個玩笑帶過去的。=...As an adult, I guess I should either just brush it off or joke about it.

而且，我也……可能，有同樣的想法。=And, I... probably, feel the same way too.

……謝謝。\n多虧了你，我心情總算平復下來了。=...Thank you. \nThanks to you, I'm starting to feel calmer.
雖然剛才說了很多不吉利的話，\n但我不會做出那麼衝動的事情的。=I know I said some scary stuff earlier,\nbut I'm not gonna do anything reckless now.
只是……好像現在我的耳邊，\n還是有一個「不像是我的我」在低語。=Even now... I feel like there's still \n"someone who isn't me" whispering in my ear.
要怎樣才能擺脫這個「不像是我的我」……\n我也不知道。=How can I free myself from that "other self"... \nI don't know.
……如果我又走入了困境，\n你還願意聽我傾訴嗎？=...If it ever gets too much to bear, \nyou'll listen to me again, won't you?
當然願意=Of course

我真的很吃驚。\n沒想到父親竟然是這麼想的。=I was really shocked. \nI had no idea that's how he felt.
然後，在那一刻，我感受到了……\n像是親子之間的某種連結……=And in that moment, I felt something... \nlike a connection between parent and child...
最後，不知怎麼的，\n我們兩個都哭著笑了出來。=In the end, somehow, we both ended up laughing through our tears.

就是剛才的事。我在想……\n如果我沒坐輪椅，說不定就能幫到奶奶了。=About earlier, I keep thinking... if only I weren't in this wheelchair, I might've been able to help Grandma.

你今天也做康復訓練了嗎？=Did you go to rehab today?

我一個人去醫院還是比較困難，\n所以都是奶奶陪我去。=It's still difficult for me to go to the hospital alone, so Grandma always goes me.
但這樣一來……\n感覺是為了我，佔用了奶奶的時間……=But this way... it feels like Grandma has to spend her time just for me...
因為不光要陪我去醫院，\n還要陪我做伸展運動……=Besides taking me to the hospital, she helped me stretch too...
我覺得奶奶可能都沒怎麼去眼科檢查。\n她眼睛變差可能也是這個原因……=I think Grandma probably hasn't been getting her regular eye checkups. That might be why her vision has gotten worse...

一旦開始想這些，就停不下來了呢……\n總是會想起很多不好的事。=Once I start dwelling on this, I can't stop... It's just one negative thought after another.
那時候也是這樣。那些負面評論，\n一直在我腦海裡……=It was the same back then. Those negative comments are always on my mind...
一切的一切都讓我害怕……說我唱得不好，\n讓我別唱了之類。雖然這些已經夠可怕了……=I'm terrified of everything... the criticisms, the "you can't sing", the "just stop". As if those weren't bad enough...
……之前，我們在這裡聊過吧。\n我看到有評論說，好像知道我家在哪。=...We've talked here before, right? I saw a comment that seemed to know my address.
要是家庭地址真的暴露了……\n那些討厭我的人，趁我在學校時找上門……=If my address is really leaked... those who hate me might show up at my home while I'm at school...
我擔心奶奶可能會受到傷害。=I'm afraid Grandma might get hurt.
雖然現在……我已經冷靜多了，\n也能比較理智地思考這些事。=I'm... more composed now. I can finally process this logically.
但那時候，我一直疑神疑鬼……比如，\n會不會學校裡的人也注意到那些評論了？=Back then, I was so paranoid... what if people at school saw those comments too?
一想到這些，\n我都不太敢去學校了……=Just thinking about it made me too scared to even go to school...

那現在呢？=What about now?
還害怕去學校嗎？=<size\=27>Still scared to go to school?</size>

討厭我的可能不只那1個人……\n說不定學校裡也還有。=Maybe it's not just that one person... \ncould be others at school too.
……不過，現在我好歹能去上學了。\n雖然坐輪椅行動不太方便。=...Still, I can go to school now. Even if getting around in a wheelchair isn't easy.
還有……我跳樓的事好像傳得挺開的。\n班上的同學都躲著我。=And... word about my suicide attempt seems to have spread. All my classmates avoid me.
可以說是……提心吊膽吧？\n只有發列印資料的時候才跟我說上幾句話。=I guess you could say... they're being overly cautious? The only words I get are when they pass me worksheets.
我理解他們的心情。如果我是他們，\n可能也不知道該怎麼和我相處。=I get how they feel. If I were them... I wouldn't know how to act around me either.
啊，但是……！=Ah, but...!
其實沒有我想像中那麼難受啦？=Is it actually not as painful as I imagined?

但……我也意識到了，\n有很多像我一樣被{{A}}的歌聲鼓舞的人。=But... I also realized there are many people like me who are encouraged by {{A}}'s singing.

……{{A}}的本音，突然變得非常低沉。=...{{A}}'s real voice suddenly got very deep.
當時真的很受打擊。\n一直都能上去的高音，突然發不出來了……=It was devastating. I suddenly couldn't hit those high notes anymore...
可{{A}}還是喜歡{{B}}，\n所以哪怕變聲了，也還是一直模仿。=But {{A}} still loved {{B}}, so even with the change, I kept mimicking her.

……也正是因為明白這一點，\n{{A}}才更難受。=...And it is precisely because {{A}} understood this that it hurt even more.
{{A}}的本音，根本不適合可愛的世界……\n繼續用這種低音只會被嘲笑。={{A}}'s real voice didn't belong in a cute world... it just invited ridicule.
……所以從那天起，\n{{A}}就開始故意修飾聲線了。=...So from that day, \n{{A}} started forcing a cuter voice.
為了沒有違和感地說出{{A}}的臺詞，\n努力地讓自己的聲音變得可愛。=Practiced Miruchu's lines endlessly until the fake voice felt natural.

所以就參考{{A}}……\n按「魔法桃桃」的角色設計了穿搭。=So I modeled it after {{A}}... \nstyled it like "Magical Peach" characters.
然後哦，在{{A}}對可愛聲線的掌控，\n幾乎就要跟本音一樣嫺熟的時候……=And then! Once {{A}}'s cute voice was as smooth as her real one...
就去挑戰了一下某部動畫的公開試音。=She tried out for an open anime audition.
雖然沒有拿到什麼重要角色，\n但被一家事務所給看中了……=Ichigo didn't land a big role, \nbut a talent agency scouted her...

那時候可開心了……\n讓{{A}}有了用可愛聲線奮鬥下去的自信呢。={{A}} was so happy then... that gave her confidence to keep using the cute voice.
……{{A}}對聲音的自卑，\n似乎遠超想像……=...{{A}}'s insecurity about their voice seems far worse than imagined...
不過或許正是這份自卑，\n讓她的慾望強大到不會被奪走……=But perhaps this insecurity made her desire too strong to steal...
{{A}}的慾望究竟會如何成長，\n好想繼續見證下去……=How will {{A}}'s desire grow? \nI want to keep watching...
所以{{A}}必須要保持可愛的聲線。\n不然就拿不到可愛的角色了啾……=So {{A}} has to keep the cute voice. \nOr she won't get cute roles anymore, chu...
這聲線是你努力的結晶=<size\=22>That voice is the fruits of your hard work</size>

{{A}}應該嘗試哪個角色呢？=Which role should {{A}} try for?

雖然可以在單次試音中，\n1次挑戰多個角色……=While you can audition for multiple roles in one session...

要不要挑戰低沉聲線的角色？=Try the deep-voiced role?

聲線可愛也好，低沉也罷……\n說到底，都是真正的{{A}}呀。=Whether cute-voiced {{A}} or deep-voiced {{A}}... they're both the real {{A}}!

所以如果有我能幫上的，\n請直接告訴我哦。=If there's anything I can do, \nplease don't hesitate to ask.
十分感謝。=Thank you very much.
那麼，回頭再聯繫。=Then, let's talk again soon.
大家，拜拜！=Bye everyone!
把參考書藏起來了？=You hid your book?
在瞞著學習的事情嗎？=<size\=30>You're keeping studies secret?</size>
嗯……沒什麼，\n也不是什麼需要在意的事。=Mmm... it's nothing worth worrying about.
如果知道我在拼命學習……=If they knew I was studying so hard...
可能會像剛才那樣，不好意思麻煩我吧，\n或者是會有所顧慮之類的？=They might hesitate to ask for help or treat me differently?
你也看到了，\n大家都是特別體貼的人。=As you saw, \nthey're all extremely considerate.
你太不會拜託別人了=You never ask for help
明明交給身邊的人就好了=<size\=28>You should rely on people more</size>
犯難的時候隨時和我說=Come to me anytime
沒有沒有，\n沒這麼誇張啦。=No no, it's not that serious.
r:"^而且，我不是總麻煩(.*)嗎？$"="Besides, don't I always trouble $1 anyway?"
嗯……不過嘛，\n現在還在我能努力解決的範圍內……=Well... for now, \nit's still within my capacity...
r:"^但你這麼說我很開心哦。\n謝謝你，(.*)。$"="But hearing you say that makes me happy. Thank you, $1."
r:"^感覺已經麻煩(.*)很多很多了……$"="Though I feel like I've already imposed on $1 so much..."
謝謝。那之後，我就不顧慮那麼多啦！=Thanks. From now on, \nI'll ask without reservation!
呐～還沒說完嗎？=Hey～ Done talking yet?
還玩木頭人嗎～？=Are we playing freeze tag～?
啊，抱歉抱歉！=Ah, sorry sorry!
r:"^那麼就從我開始當鬼吧！\n我會連(.*)同學也一起抓住的！$"="Then I'll go first! \nI'll catch $1-kun too!"
和{{A}}與孩子們玩了個盡興……=I played with {{A}} and the kids...

Rank 5
{{A}}和她父親好像在聊天……={{A}} seems to be talking with her father...
r:"^啊，(.*)同學……！$"="Ah, $1-kun...!"
哦，正好！\n方便的話，一起聊聊吧？=Oh perfect timing! \nIf you're free, could you join our chat?
很久沒和{{A}}正經聊過了，\n有些事得好好商量一下。=I haven't properly talked with {{A}} in ages, we need to discuss some important matters.
r:"^等……！爸爸你在說什麼！？\n(.*)有自己的事情要做的吧！$"="W-Wait! Dad what are you saying!? $1 has his own things to do!"
啊……哦、也是啦……\n抱歉，一時上頭。=Ah... right, my bad... I got carried away.
r:"^不好意思，(.*)君！$"="Sorry about that, $1-kun!"
下次有空的時候再來我們店哦！=Come visit our diner when you're free next time!
r:"^聽我說啊，(.*)！$"="Listen, $1!"
{{A}}這孩子，\n居然在瞞著我拼命學習！=This girl's been secretly cramming for exams behind my back!
還以為我們終於可以無話不談了，\n沒想到變成這樣……=I thought we finally had an honest relationship... How did it come to this...
都說了不是的！\n只是有空的時候稍微看看書而已啦！=That's not it! \nI'm just studying when I have spare time!
……不過呢，我也知道，\n把孩子培養得這麼能吃苦，是我的責任。=...Though I suppose raising her to be this stubborn is my fault.
哎爸爸，你聽我解釋啊。\n我……=Dad, let me explain, I just...
算了，什麼都別說了！\n聽好了{{A}}，這些事之後全都交給我！=Enough! Listen {{A}}, from now on, \nleave everything to me!
你就為了護士夢想，\n全身心地學習吧！=Focus completely on your nursing studies!
我也會和那些小不點的家長說，\n以後沒什麼時間幫忙照看他們了！=I'll tell the neighborhood kids' parents too, that you won't have time to babysit anymore!
總之不用操心店裡的事！快申請補習班！\n錢的問題也全都不要操心！=Don't worry about the store! Go sign up for cram school! Money's no concern!
我還一句話都沒說……！=I haven't said a word...!
啊，對了！\n有個親戚好像開過餐飲店。=Ah, right! My cousin used to run a restaurant.
我去問問他有沒有興趣做兼職！\n手機、手機……糟了，可能落在店裡了。=Maybe he'll work part-time! Where's my phone...? Probably left it at the store.
那，就這麼說定了啊？\n今後不許操心了！說好了！=So it's settled? \nNo need to worry! It's a deal!
啊，等一下！\n你腰不好，都說了不要跑！=Ah, wait! Your back, I told you not to run!
{{A}}的父親，\n風馳電掣地離開了……={{A}}'s father storms off in a whirlwind...
r:"^哈……對不起啊，(.*)。\n嚇到你了吧……$"="Sigh... Sorry about that, $1. \nThat must've shocked you..."
我現在也，完全是一樣的心情……=I feel the same...
很為難嗎？=Is this troubling?
不開心嗎？=Are you unhappy?
父親有這份心意，我當然很開心。=Of course I appreciate Dad's intentions...
但是，嗯……=But, well...
還是在意店裡的事？=<size\=30>Worried about the diner?</size>
擔心孩子們嗎？=<size\=30>Concerned for the kids?</size>
嗯。爸爸完全忘記自己腰還沒好。=Mhm. Dad completely forgot about his back problems.
即使找到兼職的人，\n把店裡的事從頭到尾都交給他……=Even if he finds part-time help, \nhanding over everything suddenly...
那還是會有點不太好吧。=That wouldn't be right.
而且啊，對那些孩子們的家長來說，\n突然沒人能託付了也會很犯愁吧？=And the neighborhood parents, they'd struggle without childcare.
是的呢。那些孩子還很小的時候，\n我就開始照顧他們了。=I've looked after those kids since they were toddlers.
要是現在突然拒絕，\n家長們一定會犯愁的吧。=Me refusing abruptly now would really trouble them.
還有店裡也是，我擔心爸爸的腰……=Plus I worry about Dad's back...
所以我打算至少再堅持個1年。\n但是……=I planned to keep helping for at least another year. But...
啊～我真是的，\n看書的事情怎麼就被發現了！=Ugh, how did he even find out I've been studying!?
{{A}}好像無論如何，\n也不想給父親和身邊的人添麻煩……={{A}} seems determined not to burden her father or others...
為什麼會這麼體貼別人？=Why this considerate?
不想麻煩別人的理由是？=What's the reason?
為什麼……是啊，為什麼呢？\n我自己也不太清楚。=Why...? Hmm, I'm not sure.
媽媽走得很早，爸爸也很忙。=Mom passed early, and Dad's always busy...
可能對我也有一定影響吧……=Maybe that shaped me...
反正自打我有記憶以來，\n就是這樣的性格了。=As far as I can remember, I've just always been this way.
理由？我根本沒想過這種事......\n真的只是，不擅長應對而已。=Reason? I've never thought about it... \nI'm just really bad at handling this, that's all.
怎麼說呢，自打我有記憶以來，\n就是這樣的性格了。=As far as I can remember, \nI've just always been this way.
比如小學上數學課的時候，\n會碰到弄不明白的題目吧？=Like in elementary math class, when I didn't understand something...
但如果要打斷上課向{{A}}提問，\n或者去辦公室喊{{A}}之類……=Asking the teacher during lesson or visiting the staff room...
這些我全都很不擅長。=I was terrible at that.
一想到要佔用別人的時間，\n我就會感到很抱歉。=The thought of taking others' time made me guilty.
只是一味付出不就虧了嗎？=<size\=27>Isn't it unfair to do all the giving?</size>
想幫助{{A}}的大有人在=<size\=27>Many people want to help {{A}}</size>
佔用時間也沒關係的！=<size\=27>It's okay to take people's time!</size>
虧了？\n是嗎，原來還有這種思考角度呢。=Unfair? I never thought of it that way.
一直以來，\n我都沒怎麼考慮過得失問題……=All this time, I never really considered gains or losses...
只要有誰能因為我做的事感到開心，\n那我就很開心了。=If someone's happy because of what I do, then I'm happy.
你這麼說，我很開心喲。=Hearing you say that makes me really happy.
心裡總是覺得很抱歉，\n說到底還是我自己的問題……=This guilt complex is ultimately my own issue...
不好意思，我讓你覺得很麻煩吧。\n說著說著我都覺得自己很麻煩……=Sorry for dumping this on you. Even I think I'm being difficult...
r:"^這種事也只能和(.*)講了。$"="I only feel comfortable sharing this with you, $1."
呼，謝謝。\n那今後也繼續麻煩你啦。=Whew, thanks. I'll keep relying on you then.
不過，這麼一想還挺不可思議的呢。\n我明明這麼不擅長麻煩別人……=Though it's strange. \nNormally I hate burdening people...
r:"^但面對(.*)時，\n我為什麼能這麼坦誠地依賴你呢？$"="Yet with $1, \nwhy can I be so openly dependent?"
我自己也……不太清楚。=I don't really know either.
約好了可以隨時和我商量後，\n把{{A}}送回店裡……=After promising she can consult me anytime, I walk {{A}} back to the store...
約好了可以隨時和我商量後，\n把{{A}}送回了店裡……=After promising she can consult me anytime, I walk {{A}} back to the store...

情況怎麼樣？=How's it going?
今天也很努力啊=<size\=29>You're working hard today</size>
{{A}}，還行吧。={{A}}, I'm doing okay.
r:"^啊，對了。\n有件事想告訴(.*)。$"="Oh right. There's something I wanted to tell you."
那個，前段時間，\n爸爸不是說了很多嘛？=You remember how Dad went on that rant before?
那之後，\n有個親戚家的男孩馬上就來店裡做兼職了。=After that, a relative's son started working part-time at our diner.
他特別努力認真，\n感覺已經能自己應付得過來了。=He's really diligent and already handles everything by himself.
真好啊=That's great
但是你會有點寂寞吧？=<size\=28>But you must feel a bit lonely?</size>
嗯……說實話，\n不用去店裡幫忙後變得輕鬆多了。=Well... honestly it's been easier not helping at the diner.
也不會想再勉強自己了。=I don't have to push myself as much.
沒、沒有哦？\n兼職的男孩那麼可靠……=N-No! The part-timer is so reliable...
沒、沒有哦！\n兼職的男孩那麼可靠……=N-No! The part-timer is so reliable...
事情可以放心地交給他，\n和爸爸相處得也很好，什麼問題都沒有。=We can trust him completely, \nand he gets along great with Dad.
r:"^真是的，(.*)，\n不要說些奇怪的話啊！$"="Geez, $1, don't say weird things!"
總之，學習的時間變多了，\n真是幫了大忙……=Anyway, having more study time helps a ton...
我也基本上不用再同時照看孩子們了。=I'm mostly done babysitting the neighborhood kids too.
不過，感覺身體還沒適應，\n抓不住生活節奏。=Though my body hasn't adjusted yet, \nI can't find my rhythm.
稍微有點在做白工的感覺。=Feels like I'm spinning my wheels a bit.
正好該教你學習了=Let me teach you
真的嗎？\n其實，我剛好有很多想問的。=Really? I actually have lots of questions.
r:"^啊！也不是刻意在這等(.*)的！$"="Ah! It's not like I was waiting here for you or anything!"
因為這是最能靜下心來學習的地方嘛……=This spot just helps me focus best...
r:"^呐，(.*)，你在聽嗎？$"="Hey, $1, are you listening?"
一邊安慰著解釋的{{A}}，\n一邊一起走向附近的家庭餐廳……=While comforting the flustered {{A}}, we head to a nearby diner...
怎麼樣？\n我試著自己努力了一下。=So? I've been trying my best.
和之前一起學習的時候相比，\n{{A}}進步了超級多……=Compared to when we first studied together, {{A}}'s improved dramatically.
的確努力了啊=<size\=28>You've clearly worked hard</size>
努力有回報了=<size\=28>Your efforts are paying off</size>
{{A}}，謝謝。\n有充足的時間學習果然完全不一樣呢。={{A}}, thanks. Having proper study time makes all the difference.
我感覺最近好像……\n怎麼說呢，能抓住學習的要領了？=Lately I feel like... \nI'm finally grasping how to study properly.
但是光靠自己，\n解決不了的問題也變多了。=But the problems I can't solve alone keep increasing.
r:"^也不能總是依賴(.*)。$"="I can't keep relying on $1 forever..."
或許像爸爸說的，\n考慮一下補習班比較好啊……=Maybe Dad's right about considering cram school...
在犯愁嗎？=<size\=30>Having second thoughts?</size>
想去嗎？=Want to go?
我還是挺想去的。\n但你知道嗎？補習班特別貴！=I really do... but cram schools are so expensive!
所以等店裡穩定下來之前，\n我還想再稍微看看情況啊。=I want to wait until the diner's more stable first.
也怕爸爸再那樣勉強著亂來……=Also I'm worried Dad might overexert himself...
理性的女性=Rational Woman

抱歉打擾你們學習了。再見！=Sorry for interrupting your studies. Goodbye!
請等一下！=Please wait!
「{{A}}」，是我媽媽的名字。\n她很久之前就去世了。="{{A}}" was my mother's name. \nShe passed long ago.

對。我記憶中媽媽的樣子，\n是帥氣強大的「正義的夥伴」。=Yes. The Mom I remember was this cool, \nstrong "hero of justice".
我……也想成為那樣的護士。=I... want to be that kind of nurse too.
不過，我現在還在拼命學習，\n準備考入護士學校。=Though I'm still studying desperately to get into nursing school.
說到底，\n我甚至還不知道自己適不適合當護士呢。=Truthfully, \nI don't even know if I'm cut out for it...
呐，只是提個建議啊……=Here's an idea...
願意的話，下次要不要來我單位，\n試一下志願者的工作？=How about trying volunteer work at my hospital?

因為不想傷害他=<size\=30>Didn't want to hurt him</size>
因為想對老爺爺溫柔一點=<size\=28>Wanted to be gentle with him</size>
嗯，我也是這麼想的。\n正是因為很體諒對方呢。=Exactly, I think so too. \nIt came from consideration.
但因為體諒別人而顧慮過多，\n沒法把心中所想的說出口。=But being too considerate can make it hard to speak your mind.
大概……{{A}}在平常的生活中，\n也有這樣的毛病吧？=Most likely... {{A}}, doesn't this happen in your daily life too?

於是我思考了很多。\n覺得要先和爸爸好好談談。=So I've been thinking hard about it. I've decided I should have a proper talk with Dad first.
爸爸他明明那麼直率地，\n向我表達了自己的想法……=Even though Dad's always been so straightforward with me...
可我心裡卻總是懷有一些顧慮。=I keep holding myself back with unnecessary reservations.
所以我想先把這些顧慮全部放下，\n和他好好談一次。=So I want to set all those worries aside and have an honest conversation.

我是打算和他單獨談談的……=I meant to talk privately but...

嗯，偶爾去健身房……\n不管怎麼說，還是騎車舒服。=I go to the gym sometimes... but honestly, cycling's more comfortable.
話雖如此，但為了不再暴走，\n我現在會儘量克制自己呢。=Still, to avoid going berserk, I'm trying to control myself now.
……不過呢，我後來不是失控了嗎，\n所以現在會儘量克制自己了。=...But, well, I kind of went berserk, \nso I'm trying to control myself now.
不過，只要不像我那樣上強度，\n我還是推薦你也騎一騎哦。=But if you don't push yourself too hard like me, I'd definitely recommend it!
可以隨心所欲地去很多地方呢！=You can freely go wherever you want!
接下來得去樓上看看……=Now I need to check upstairs...
水島，你複習得怎麼樣啦？=Mizushima, how's studying?
……完全不行，什麼都學不會。\n說實話我都想放棄了。=...It's terrible. I don't get any of it. \nHonestly, I'm just gonna give up.
{{A}}，為什麼呀？\n和男朋友一起學不就好了嘛。={{A}}, why? Couldn't you study with your boyfriend?
不行啦，會暴露我很笨的……=No way! He'd find out how dumb I am...
我什麼都不懂，\n連該問什麼問題都不知道……=I don't understand anything, I don't even know what questions to ask...
{{A}}……\n果然，我本來就不是這塊料啊。={{A}}... I guess I'm just not cut out for this.
不適合的事還是算啦。\n真不該想些有的沒的……=I should've just accepted it. \nI shouldn't have gotten my hopes up...
不是那樣的！=That's not true!
你在偷聽我們說話啊！？=Were you eavesdropping on us!?
啊，不好意思……\n我不是故意的……=Ah, sorry... \nI didn't mean to...
但是，水島同學！\n別輕言放棄啊！=But, Mizushima-san! \nDon't give up so easily!
現在開始備考也完全來得及！\n{{A}}也會幫你的！=It's not too late to start studying now! \n{{A}} will help you too!
等一下，聲音太大了……！=Wait, you're too loud...!
{{A}}，啊……={{A}}, ah...
你看吧，\n周圍的氣氛也在說我不適合學習啊……=See, even the atmosphere here says I'm not meant for studying...
總之！我不考了！別管我了！=Anyway! I'm done! Just leave me alone!
水島同學……！=Mizushima-san...!
不好意思，{{A}}。\n水島同學可能壓力有點大。=Sorry, {{A}}. Mizushima-san's probably just stressed.
別生她的氣啦！\n那，再見！=Don't be mad at her! \nWell, see you!
好像把她惹急了……=Seems like I upset her...
真希望她別放棄啊。\n要是我能幫上忙就好了……=I really hope she doesn't give up. \nI wish I could help...
之後繼續在校園裡巡視，\n直到放學……=We continued patrolling the school until school ended...

Rank 7
r:"^啊，(.*)同學。\n接下來我準備去巡視，要一起嗎？$"="Ah, $1-kun. I'm about to start my patrol, \ndo you want to join me?"
呼……=Sigh...
沒精神嗎？=Feeling down?
有心事嗎？=<size\=29>Something on your mind?</size>
啊，不好意思。\n不知不覺歎了口氣……=Ah, sorry. \nI didn't mean to sigh like that...
前陣子……水島同學的事情，\n我還是放心不下。=I've been thinking about what happened to Mizushima-san the other day.
我也問過她的班主任了，\n她好像完全沒提過想報考學校的事。=I even asked her homeroom teacher, but it seems she never mentioned anything about applying to schools.
真的要放棄了嗎……=Is she really giving up...?
你很擔心嗎？=Are you worried?
不想讓她放棄嗎？=<size\=28>Don't want her to give up?</size>
是的。雖說她之前，\n確實不算是很認真的學生。=Yes. Even though she wasn't the most serious student...
但正因為這樣，\n她能打起精神來我才覺得很可貴呀。=That's exactly why I found it so precious that she was finally motivated.
我不想打擊她的積極性，\n只是想支持她……=I don't want to discourage her, \nI just want to support her...
啊，水島同學！=Ah, Mizushima-san!
前陣子不好意思啊。要是你方便的話，\n能不能去{{A}}稍微聊一聊……？=Sorry about the other day. If you have time, let's talk in the {{A}} for a bit...?
啊？{{A}}？\n我可什麼都沒做啊？=Huh? {{A}}? \nI didn't do anything wrong!
不是的！關於你報考……志願學校的事，\n我想好好了解一下。=No! It's about your college applications... \nI want to hear more about it.
算了吧……我沒什麼要和{{A}}聊的……=Forget it... I have nothing to talk to {{A}}...
別這麼說嘛。\n雖然考場上只能靠自己……=Don't say that. Of course, it's you who will actually be taking the exam...
但作為{{A}}，我現在想盡可能地支持你。\n能不能先告訴我，你想報考哪所學校呢？=But as a teacher, I want to support you as much as possible. So first of all, could you tell me which school you're applying to?
{{A}}，什麼什麼？\n水島，你要參加考試啊？={{A}}, what? \nMizushima, you're taking exams?
突然怎麼了，這麼認真啊～！=Since when did you get so serious～!
……我最討厭這樣了。=...I hate this.
水島同學？=Mizushima-san?
我、我才不參加什麼考試呢！\n你別在這裡亂說！=I-I'm not taking any exams! \nStop spreading rumors!
{{A}}……搞砸了。\n她好像真的生氣了呢……={{A}}... This is bad. \nShe seemed really angry...
又做了多餘的事……\n要是她真的不想考了可怎麼辦……=I did something unnecessary... What if she really doesn't want to take the exam...
冷靜點=Calm down
轉換下心情吧=Let's change the mood
{{B}}，那就是{{A}}你的不對了！\n你根本不懂女高中生的心思。={{B}}, It's {{A}}'s fault for not understanding the heart of a high school girl.
怎麼，難道{{A}}你懂嗎？=What? What exactly do you understand, {{A}}?
我畢竟也是個大叔了，\n對自己的細膩程度沒什麼自信。=I'm an uncle, \nso I'm not so sure about my delicacy.
但{{A}}你啊，從高中起就……=But {{A}}-chan, ever since you were a high school girl...
哪怕穿著裙子，\n也能對其他學校的老大使出漂亮的迴旋踢！=Even in a skirt, she can throw a mean roundhouse kick at some rival school boss!
穿著裙子……？=In a skirt...?
迴旋踢……？=Roundhouse kick...?
裡面穿了安全褲啦！=For the record, I was wearing safety shorts underneath!
而且如果有時間的話，\n應該換上特攻服的……=And if I had time, \nI would've changed into my combat uniform...
特攻服！？=Combat uniform!?
女子幫派那種！？=Like a ladies' gang!?
啊，是的。\n班裡有個女生加入了女子幫派。=Ah, yeah. I had a classmate who was in a ladies' gang.
我都拒絕她好多次了，\n她還是一直勸我加入……=I turned her down so many times, \nbut she kept insisting I join...
還送了我一套特攻服，\n說好歹要收下。=She even gave me a combat uniform and said I should at least take it.
然後嘛，我偶爾就會穿一下，\n覺得這樣就不會弄髒制服了。=So, sometimes I wore it, thinking it'd keep my uniform clean.
對吧？把特攻服當運動服穿，\n你不覺得作為女高中生有點奇特嗎？=Right? Wearing a combat uniform like gym clothes, don't you think that's pretty strange for a high school girl?
她以前是不良少女嗎？=Was she a delinquent?
她以前經常打架嗎？=<size\=25>Did she often get into fights?</size>
啊！我好像之前也說過，\n{{A}}其實並不是不良少女吧？=Ah! Like I said before, {{A}} wasn't really a delinquent, right?
只是經常惹人注意而已……=She just stood out a lot...
是啊，那時候……=Yeah, back then...
和父母關係不好，不想回家。\n而且也沒什麼朋友。=I didn't get along with my parents, didn't want to go home. And I didn't have many friends.
喜歡1個人在外面逛到很晚，\n或者騎腳踏車到處亂逛……=I liked wandering alone until late, \nor cycling around aimlessly...
遇到上來搭訕的混混和不良少年，\n我就會直接反擊……=She fought back against the guys who tried to pick her up or mug her...
遇到上來搭訕的混混和不良少年，\n就會直接反擊……=She fought back against the guys who tried to pick her up or mug her...
不知不覺，就被人說成「{{A}}」、\n「傳說中的四大天王」之類的了。=Before she knew it, people started calling her "{{A}}", or "One of the Four Legendary Kings."
{{A}}，現在想想，要說正當防衛，\n當時好像做得有點過頭了……={{A}}, looking back, I might've overdone it even if it was self-defense...
但也沒辦法啊？\n是他們先找碴的嘛。=But what else could I do? \nThey started it.
好帥啊……=So cool...
真想看看……=I want to see it...
想當你的小弟……=<size\=25>I want to be your underling...</size>
並不帥啦。\n哪怕我沒有什麼壞心思，但不良就是不良。=It wasn't cool. Even without bad intentions, a delinquent is still a delinquent.
真的……要是沒有{{A}}，\n我都不知道現在會變成什麼樣的大人……=Really... I wonder what kind of adult I would have become if it weren't for {{A}}.
別這樣，要是被學生看到那時候的樣子，\n我會羞愧到找個縫鑽進去的！=Stop it! I'd die of embarrassment if my students saw me like that back then.
真是太傻了……要是沒有{{A}}，\n我都不知道現在會變成什麼樣的大人……=I was stupid... I wonder what kind of adult I would have become if it weren't for {{A}}.
別胡說了。\n那種事沒什麼好憧憬的啦。=Stop talking nonsense. \nThere's nothing to admire about that.
啊，{{A}}是我的恩師。=Ah, {{A}} is my mentor.
在我和{{A}}、父母都鬧彆扭，\n誰都不相信的時候……=When I was stubborn and I couldn't trust my teachers, my parents, or anyone...
只有他是始終向我伸出援手的人……=He was the only one who kept reaching out to me...
我也想成為他那樣的人……\n但好像沒那麼容易……=I wanted to be like him too... \nbut it's not so easy...
那是當然。那時候的{{A}}，\n從業時間已經是現在{{B}}的2倍以上了。=Of course. Back then, {{A}} had already been teaching twice as long as you have now.
要是那麼就能輕易追上的話，\n我也能追上{{A}}了。=If it were that easy to catch up, \nI'd have caught up to {{A}} too.
反正，{{A}}你一直都很「熱血」。=Anyway, you've always been so "passionate", {{A}}.
現在的年輕人，\n說不定會覺得那樣有點煩人呢。=Kids these days might find that kind of annoying.
還是要注意，\n別強行把自己的想法灌輸給別人哦。=Be careful not to force your ideas on others, okay?
今天謝謝你約我吃拉麵。=Thank you for inviting me for ramen today.
雖然放學後{{A}}和學生一起吃飯什麼的，\n並不是件值得炫耀的事……=Even though a teacher and student eating together after school isn't something to boast about...
r:"^但和(.*)同學，\n還有(.*)聊過之後，我感覺輕鬆了一些。$"="But after talking with you and $2, \nI feel a little better."
我也意識到，\n我對水島同學的態度太強硬了。=I realized that I was too pushy with Mizushima-san.
……{{A}}，也讓你聽了不少難為情的事呢。=...{{A}}, I made you listen to a lot of embarrassing stories.
嗯，現在也有點晚了。\n直接回家吧！=Well, it's already late. \nHead straight home, no detours!
明天學校見啦！=See you tomorrow at school!

Rank 9
別太激動=<size\=30>Don't get too worked up</size>
別太強勢了=Don't be too pushy
嗯，我知道的……！=Mhm, I know...!
那個……水島同學……=Um... Mizushima-san...
徹底被水島同學討厭了……=She totally hates me now...
對了，\n她是為了學習才來圖書室的吧……？=She came to the library to study, right...?
都怪我多管閒事，\n讓她錯過了學習的機會……=Because I meddled, \nshe missed her chance to study...
糟透了……\n不但沒幫上忙還添亂……=This is terrible... \nI didn't help at all, I just made things worse...
今天也轉換下心情吧……！=<size\=25>Let's also change the mood today...!</size>
今天吃點甜食吧……！=<size\=28>Let's have some sweets today...!</size>
哇……\n我都多少年沒吃過可麗餅了啊……=Wow... It's been years since I had a crepe...
……不好吧。\n前幾天剛一起去吃了拉麵……=...Is this okay? \nWe just had ramen together the other day...
放學後和學生一起買東西吃什麼的……=A teacher and student shopping for snacks after school...
甜食就是正義=Sweets are justice
找回學生時代的感覺吧=<size\=30>Let's relive your student days</size>
{{A}}。好吧，光是看這賣相，\n就莫名地讓人打起精神來了呢。={{A}}. Okay, just looking at how colorful they are already cheering me up.
今天就破例吧！\n謝謝你帶我來。=I'll make an exception today! \nThanks for bringing me here.
原來如此，要理解水島同學的心情，\n得先從可麗餅開始……？=I see... To understand Mizushima-san's feelings, \nI must start with crepes...?
……哪有這種道理呀！\n但……還是謝謝你帶我來。=...That makes no sense! \nBut... thanks for inviting me anyway.
那麼，看菜單吧！\n選什麼口味呢，{{A}}還是香蕉……=Now, let's check the menu! What flavor should I get, strawberry or banana...
酒吧店長=Bar Manager
{{B}}，{{A}}？={{B}}, {{A}}?
哎呀，真是巧了！\n沒想到在店外也能遇到～！=Oh, what a coincidence! \nFancy meeting you outside the shop～!
{{A}}，等等……你怎麼會在這裡！={{A}}, wait... what are you doing here!?
好像是{{A}}的……=<size\=30>The one from {{A}}...</size>
之前在酒吧……=The one from the bar...
是{{A}}常去的那家，\n{{B}}酒吧的店長……=It's the manager of that {{B}} bar {{A}} often goes to...
哎喲喲～討厭，還帶了個可愛的男孩子～！\n什麼情況，是約會嗎？是約會吧？=Ooh la la～ You brought a cute boy with you～! What's this, a date? It's a date, right?
怎麼可能！\n這孩子是我的學生！=No way! \nThis is my student!
啊！之前你在我們店裡喝得爛醉，\n就是他來把你訓了一頓吧！=Ah! He's the one who scolded you when you got wasted at our place!
唔……我真希望你忘了那件事……=Ugh... I wish you'd forget that...
{{A}}，所以今天，\n你們倆是在進行可麗餅約會囉？={{A}}, so today, you two are on a crepe date?
這不是挺好的嘛，\n比在{{A}}喝酒健康多啦～=That's great though, much healthier than drinking in {{A}}～
都說了！不是約會啦！=I said it's not a date!
是想讓{{A}}振作起來……=<size\=29>I'm trying to cheer up {{A}}...</size>
是為了聽{{A}}訴苦……=<size\=26>It's to listen to {{A}}'s troubles...</size>
約會的事要保密哦……=<size\=29>Let's keep this date a secret...</size>
嗯，說起來有點不好意思，\n我在學校遇到點煩心事……=Well, it's a bit embarrassing, but I've been dealing with some issues at school...
現在是這位學生在鼓勵我呢。=This student is here to encourage me.
{{A}}，說起來有點不好意思，\n但確實是這樣……={{A}}, it's a little embarrassing, but yeah, that's right...
在學校遇到了點煩心事……\n這位學生很關心我。=I've been dealing with some issues at school... This student really cares about me.
你也別亂說啦！=Don't you start too!
說起來有點不好意思，\n其實是我在學校遇到點煩心事。=It's a bit embarrassing, but I've been dealing with some issues at school...
我讓他陪我一起，是為了散心。=I asked him to come with me to clear my head.
哎呀～這也挺不錯的嘛！\n{{A}}，你有個很好的學生呢！=Aw～ That's so sweet! \nYou've got a great student, {{A}}!
{{A}}，是啊。是個好學生吧？={{A}}, right? He's a good kid, isn't he?
那展開說說？\n{{A}}遇到什麼事啦？=Wanna share the details? \nWhat's bothering you, {{A}}?
跟酒吧店長，\n說了水島同學的事……=I told the bar manager about Mizushima-san...
啊～我有點理解那個學生的心情呢。=Ah～ I think I get how that student feels.
如果被其他同學看到自己在努力，\n就會覺得非常羞恥吧。=If other classmates saw me trying hard, \nI'd be super embarrassed too.
……但是，努力本身並不是壞事啊。=...But working hard itself isn't a bad thing.
話是這麼說，\n但大家都有叛逆期嘛！=True, but everyone goes through a rebellious phase!
就是那種，沒法坦率面對自己的年紀啦。\n{{A}}你也有過吧？=It's that age where you can't be honest with yourself. You had that too, right, {{A}}?
{{A}}也說過吧？\n說「{{B}}讓我吃了不少苦頭啊」之類的！={{A}} said it too, right? Something like, "{{B}} gave me a hard time!"
你們高中就認識嗎？=<size\=20>You know each other in high school?</size>
你和{{A}}認識嗎？=<size\=30>Do you know {{A}}?</size>
不是啦，我是{{B}}成年後才認識的。\n本來是{{A}}他常來我們店裡……=Nah, I met {{B}} after she's an adult. Originally, {{A}} was a regular at our place...
後來，{{A}}到了能喝酒的年紀，\n就把她一起帶來了。=Later, when {{A}} became old enough to drink, he started bringing her along.
是的，本來{{A}}就是我們店的常客啦。=Yep, {{A}} was a regular at our shop.
明明很想改變自己，\n卻一直邁不出第一步，真讓人著急……=Even though you want to change, taking that first step is so hard... it's frustrating.
{{A}}也這麼說過你吧？={{A}} said that about you too, right?
然而……{{A}}那麼擔心我，我卻態度惡劣，\n辜負了他的心意……=But... back then, even though he cared so much, I acted awful and let him down...
什麼讓你打開心扉了呢？=What made you open up?
你信任{{A}}的契機是什麼？=<size\=29>What made you trust {{A}}?</size>
我想想，嗯……\n說不上來有什麼特別的事件。=Let me think... hmm... \nThere wasn't one big moment.
只是……無論我拒絕多少次，\n{{A}}都依然很關心我……=Just... no matter how many times I pushed him away, he never stopped caring...
我突然就意識到，啊，\n這個人不會放棄我，是真的為我著想。=Suddenly I realized this person won't give up on me. He genuinely cares.
不放棄很重要=Not giving up is key
關鍵在於花時間=<size\=30>It's about spending time</size>
是啊……{{A}}一直不離不棄，\n不斷向我伸出援手……=Yeah... {{A}} never gave up, \nhe kept reaching out...
雖然傳達心意需要時間，\n但只要堅持下去，總有一天……=Getting through to someone takes time, \nbut if you keep at it, someday...
沒錯，永不放棄哦，{{A}}！\n加油！=Exactly! Never give up, {{A}}! \nYou can do it!
先不說這個，為了讓你打起精神，\n來我們店裡喝一杯怎麼樣？=Anyway, to cheer you up, \nwhy not come to our place for a drink?
怎麼可能去嘛！\n我和學生在一起呢！真是的！=No way! I'm with a student! Seriously!
今天謝謝你啦。\n沒想到會遇到店長。=Thanks for today. \nI didn't expect to run into the manager.
關於水島同學的事，\n我會繼續努力的。=I'll keep trying with Mizushima-san.
水島同學……=Mizushima-san...
不行啊，現在不能追上去。\n得忍住……=I can't approach her now. \nI have to hold back...
{{A}}也注意到了水島同學……={{A}} also noticed Mizushima-san...
{{A}}？你說要留意一下水島的情況嗎？\n但是……={{A}}? You said to keep an eye on Mizushima? But...
還是算了吧……=Forget it...
水島同學看的好像是，\n各大學的入學考試試題集……=Mizushima-san was looking at... entrance exam papers for various colleges...
水島同學在看試題集？\n那說不定其中就有她想考的學校呢……=Mizushima-san was looking at exam papers? Then maybe one of those is for the school she wants...
r:"^真是謝謝你了，(.*)同學。$"="Thank you very much, $1-kun."
還有，今天謝謝你約我。\n好久沒吃可麗餅了，很好吃哦！=And thanks for inviting me out today. I haven't had a crepe in ages, it was delicious!

Rank 11
r:"^啊，(.*)同學。\n今天就不巡視了，打算稍微調查一下……$"="Ah, $1-kun. I'm not patrolling today, I was planning to do some investigating instead..."
又不是巡視，\n你不陪我也沒關係哦？=It's not patrolling, so you don't have to come with me, you know?
又不是巡視，\n你不陪我也沒關係哦！=It's not patrolling, so you don't have to come with me, you know?
反正我有空……=I'm free anyway...
如果有我能幫上忙的……=If I can help...
是嗎？那也行吧……=Is that so? \nWell, alright then...
{{A}}，謝謝。\n不過也沒什麼需要你幫忙的事啦。={{A}}, thanks. \nBut there's not much you need to do.
之前，我們透過水島同學看的參考書，\n不是知道了她想考的學校嗎？=Remember how we figured out Mizushima-san's target school from that book she was reading?
我就想著根據她的學習能力，\n查一下她能考上哪個系，還有考試傾向之類。=I thought I'd look into which subjects she might qualify for, based on her academic level, and exam trends...
而且，如果她想和男友一起上大學的話……=And if she wants to go to the same college as her boyfriend...
我覺得也可以考慮一下沿線的其他學校。=I think we could also consider other schools along the same line.
比如說這所……=For example, this one...
……哎呀，又多管閒事了吧。\n明明我心裡是知道的……=...Ah, I'm meddling again, aren't I? \nI know I shouldn't...
我又不是她的班主任，\n做這麼多又能怎樣……=I'm not even her homeroom teacher, \nwhat good does doing all this do...?
最後，說不定她還會覺得我煩。=In the end, she might just find me annoying.
可是，我就是忍不住……=But I can't help it...
是不是想到自己的經歷了=Thinking of your past?
是不是想到恩師了=<size\=30>Thinking of your mentor?</size>
……是啊。我也這麼想。=...Yeah. I think so.
當初我啊，高中都過完一半了，\n都沒想過考大學的事。=Back then, I was already halfway through high school and hadn't even considered college.
我從來沒想過，\n自己未來甚至還有那樣的選擇……=I never imagined I had that kind of future option...
當時，我只想著趕緊參加工作，離開家。=At the time, I just wanted to start working and leave home as soon as possible.
但{{A}}一直關心我，\n嚴厲地教導我……=But {{A}} kept looking out for me, teaching me strictly...
能遇到對自己那麼認真的大人……=Meeting an adult who took me that seriously...
我開始覺得，或許未來還有希望。=Made me start feeling like maybe there was hope for the future.
於是……我開始拼命學習，\n懂的事情越來越多，世界也變廣闊了。=So... I started studying desperately, learning more and more, and my world expanded.
我覺得，現在的水島同學……\n她可能也處在和我當時一樣的轉捩點。=I think Mizushima-san right now... might be at the same kind of turning point I was.
但我好像一直在給她添麻煩……=But it seems like I'm just causing trouble for her...
{{A}}是好{{B}}=<size\=22>{{A}} is a good {{B}}</size>
總有一天她會明白的=<size\=28>She'll understand someday</size>
確實很難傳達到……=It's hard to convey...
謝謝……\n但我什麼都沒做好。=Thank you... \nBut I haven't done anything right.
一直做無用功，我自己都有點喪氣了。=I keep beating a dead horse, \nit's starting to get me down.
如果是{{A}}，他會怎麼做呢……=What would {{A}} do in this situation...?
要是那樣就好了……\n但考試越來越近了呀……=I hope so... \nBut the exams are getting closer...
我很著急。\n但我也知道自己在做無用功。=I'm worried. But I know I'm just beating a dead horse.
嗯……我有種很無力的感覺。=Mhm... I feel so powerless.
啊，她給我發了個訊息。\n就是那個，{{A}}酒吧的店長……=Ah, I got a message from her. \nThe {{A}} bar's manager...
{{A}}看著{{B}}={{A}} looking at {{B}}
啊，沒什麼。\n聽說昨晚{{A}}突然去她的酒吧了。=Ah, it's nothing. Apparently, {{A}} suddenly showed up at her bar last night.
{{A}}因為家裡的事，幾年前搬回鄉下了。=He moved back to his hometown a few years ago due to family matters.
從那以後，\n我和他也就是偶爾互相寄點賀年卡……=Since then, \nwe've only exchanged New Year's cards...
現在他來東京出差，\n還要在這裡待幾天。=He's in Tokyo for a business trip now and will be here for a few days.
去見見他怎麼樣？=Why not go see him?
是個求教的好機會=<size\=24>It's a chance to ask for advice</size>
確實呢……我想見見他。=You're right... I'd like to see him.
雖然我是大人了，說這些還挺難為情的，\n但我還是想向{{A}}請教請教……=Even though I'm an adult now, it's a little embarrassing to say, but I still want to seek his guidance...

嗯，可以啊。\n我覺得見他對你也有好處。=Mhm, sure. I think meeting him is good for you too.
確實，見{{A}}對你可能也有好處呢。=Actually, meeting {{A}} might be good for you too.

好，那我們走吧。\n我們約在{{A}}的家庭餐廳見面。=Okay, let's go then. \nWe're meeting at a diner in {{A}}.
好久不見，{{A}}。=Long time no see, {{A}}.
喲，{{A}}！你都長大啦！\n看著就像{{B}}。=Yo, {{A}}! You're all grown up! \nYou look like a proper teacher now.
剛當{{A}}那陣子，你還像個穿著運動服，\n在校園裡跑來跑去的高中生似的。=When you first started teaching, you still looked like a high schooler running around the campus in gym clothes.
您別這麼說啦，這還有學生在呢……=Please don't say that, there's a student here...
你是{{A}}班上的學生吧？=You're {{A}}'s students, right?
啊，{{A}}！\n你這孩子真有意思。=Ah, nice to meet you! \nYou seem like an interesting kid.
跑來見我這個老頭，挺無聊的吧。=It must be boring to come see an old man like me.
您是{{A}}的恩師……=<size\=26>You're {{A}}'s mentor...</size>

恩師？{{A}}，你這麼跟人介紹的啊？\n真讓人害臊！=Mentor? {{A}}, so that's how you introduced me? How embarrassing!

那我就給你講講，{{A}}年輕時的事情吧！=Then let me tell you some stories about {{A}}'s youth!

啊，你是想聽……\n{{A}}當「四大天王」那時候的事情吧？=Ah, you want to hear about... the time {{A}} was one of the "Four Legendary Kings," right?
{{A}}，那我就多和你聊聊，\n這傢伙年輕時的那些事情！={{A}}, then let me share more about this one's wild younger days!
真是的……請您嘴下留情啊。=Honestly... please have mercy.
聽了{{A}}學生時代的事……=I heard stories about {{A}}'s school days...
好像她開始拼命學習後，\n非常辛苦，很難跟上進度……=Seems like after she started studying seriously, she struggled to keep up...
總之，這傢伙以前真是個問題學生。=Anyway, this one was quite the problem student back then.
{{A}}，好丟人……={{A}}, so embarrassing...
r:"^真不該帶(.*)同學來的……$"="I never should've brought $1-kun along..."
我聽得很過癮=I enjoyed listening
都是些趣聞=They were fun stories
真是的……你這孩子啊。=Really... you're something else.
……那麼，{{A}}啊。=...Then, {{A}}.
你是不是有什麼事情想找我商量啊？=You have something you want to discuss, don't you?
{{A}}，啊，這個……={{A}}, ah, um...
你高中時也是這樣。\n想跟人傾訴什麼的時候，就莫名地坐立不安。=You were like this in high school too. Whenever you had something on your mind, you'd get all fidgety.
怎麼，是在學校遇到煩心事了？=What, trouble at school?
……{{A}}您真是明察秋毫。\n其實……=...You see right through me, {{A}}. \nActually...
嗯，原來如此啊。\n也就是說……=Mhm, I see. \nSo in other words...
{{A}}，你是想得到那個學生的「認可」，\n對吧？={{A}}, you want that student's "approval," don't you?
{{A}}……？\n不，我只是想幫她……={{A}}...? \nNo, I just want to help her...
是嗎？想幫她，\n不就是想讓她認可你是個優秀的{{A}}嗎？=Is that so? Wanting to help her means you want her to acknowledge you as a good teacher, right?
我想成為像{{A}}您這樣的教師，\n想像您當初幫我那樣去幫她……=I want to be a teacher like you, \nand help her like you helped me...
瞧，這不就是了。=See? There it is.
想成為像我這樣的{{A}}，\n這可是你以前就掛在嘴邊的話……=Wanting to be like me, \nthat's what you always used to say...
你這是為了達成自己的目標，\n在利用學生吧？=Aren't you just using that student to achieve your goals?
怎……怎麼會……=Th-That's not...
你是想成為理想中的自己，\n所以才渴望做些與之相符的事……=You want to become your ideal self, so you're eager to do things that match that image...
聽起來，你是把這種自私的慾望，\n強加給學生了。=It sounds like you're forcing your selfish desires onto your student.
{{A}}是真的很擔心=<size\=26>{{A}}'s genuinely concerned</size>
{{A}}一直在努力=<size\=29>{{A}}'s been trying hard</size>
那當然啦。\n但，你現在這麼著急卻毫無進展……=Of course. But you're rushing and making no progress...
不就是因為，\n你一心想把學生引向你心中的目標嗎？=Isn't it because you're too focused on steering the student toward your goals?
如果說，那個學生經過深思熟慮，\n說還是想直接參加工作的話……=If that student, after careful thought, said she still wants to start working right away...
你能不反對，而是全力支持她嗎？=Could you support her fully without objecting?
可是……她想去上大學……\n所以……=But... she wants to go to college... so...
孩子們的真實想法，\n不是你能擅自下定論的。=You can't decide the true feelings of children on your own.
人心每天都在變。\n更何況是高中生。=People's hearts change every day. Especially high schoolers.
{{A}}的工作，就是看著他們，\n在合適的時候伸出援手。=Our job is to watch over them and lend a hand at the right time.
就算犯錯了，\n也別想著「一定要掰回正確的方向」。=Even if they make mistakes, \ndon't think "I must correct them."
當然，如果他們快要偏離正道了，\n還是得稍微指指路才行。=Of course, if they're about to go down the wrong path, you should still guide them a little.
孩子們都有自己往前走的能力。=Children have the ability to move forward on their own.
在他們困難的時候，不管你有多想伸手幫忙，\n都得先忍住，默默守護他們。=When they struggle, no matter how much you want to help, you must hold back and watch over them in silence.
這才是大人的職責啊，{{A}}。=That's the adult's duty, {{A}}.
r:"^再見啦，(.*)。\n(.*)同學，(.*)就拜託你啦！$"="See you later, $1. $2-kun, take care of $3 for me!"
好的，包在我身上=Okay, leave it to me

啊，你也是。再見！=Ah, you too. Goodbye!
{{A}}，今天……不，該說今天也一樣啊。\n讓你看到我丟臉的一面了。={{A}}, today... or rather, as usual, \nyou saw my embarrassing side.
也聽到了好多故事=Heard lots of stories
不丟臉=It wasn't embarrassing
我不在意=I don't mind
{{A}}，希望你能趕快忘掉……={{A}}, I hope you forget it soon...
嗯……你真溫柔呢。=Mhm... you're really kind.
真是的……最近在你面前，\n我感覺自己一點{{A}}的樣子都沒有。=Honestly... lately, around you, I feel like I'm not acting like a teacher at all.

我……我感覺自己內心深處，\n其實把水島同學的煩惱當成了「機會」。=I... I think deep down, I saw Mizushima-san's struggles as an "opportunity."
我終於有機會像{{A}}當初幫我那樣，\n去幫自己的學生了……=Finally, I had a chance to help my student like {{A}} helped me...
這是個機會，\n能成為像{{A}}那樣的教師……=An opportunity to become a teacher like {{A}}...
這種情況誰都有=<size\=25>Everyone does that sometimes</size>

就算這樣，我也不想完全放棄。=Even so, I don't want to give up.
一旦開始想這些，腦子就停不下來了。=Once I start thinking about it, \nmy mind won't stop.
{{A}}，抱歉。\n你應該也不想聽{{B}}抱怨這些吧！={{A}}, sorry. You probably don't want to hear your teacher complain like this!
你接下來有時間嗎？=<size\=30>Do you have time now?</size>

附近能租到腳踏車……=We can rent bicycles nearby...
給{{A}}說明了，\n事先查好的市內騎行路線……=I explained to {{A}} the city cycling route I researched in advance...
也就是說……要一起去騎行嗎？=So... you want to go cycling together?
{{A}}……真是服了你了……={{A}}... you're something else...
確實，如果是正規的騎行路線，\n怎麼盡情地騎車都不會影響其他人。=You're right, if it's a proper cycling route, we can cycle to our heart's content without bothering anyone.
那……就一起走吧。=Then... let's go.
r:"^好啦，出發吧，\n(.*)同學！$"="Alright, let's go, $1-kun!"
騎著租來的腳踏車，\n和{{A}}一起開始騎行……=I started cycling with {{A}} on rented bicycle...
哎哎，不加把勁的話我可要把你丟下啦！=Come on, if you don't push yourself, \nI'll leave you behind!
現在就累還太早啦！\n好了，我要加速囉！=It's too early to be tired now! \nOkay, I'm speeding up!
{{A}}以驚人的速度，\n狂飆而去……={{A}} zoomed ahead at an incredible speed...
我拼命踩著踏板，\n追趕著{{A}}的影子……=I pedaled desperately, chasing after {{A}}'s shadow...
啊——騎得真痛快！\n感覺太棒啦～！=Ah- That was a great ride! \nI feel amazing～!
{{A}}，你還挺厲害的呢！\n居然能一直跟著我到這裡！={{A}}, you're pretty good! \nYou kept up with me all the way here!

{{A}}，是啊！\n就算是男生，能跟上我的也不多呢。={{A}}, yeah! Even among boys, not many can keep up with me.
獎勵你一份大碗拉麵怎麼樣？\n……不過，現在估計也吃不下吧。=How about a large bowl of ramen as a reward? ...Though you probably can't eat right now.
抱歉抱歉！\n要不把腳踏車還了，坐電車回去吧！=Sorry, sorry! Let's return the bicycles and take the train back!
r:"^……謝謝你啊，(.*)同學。$"="...Thank you, $1-kun."
我那到處飆車的高中時代啊……=Back in my high school days when I'd cycle everywhere...
當時，真的完全看不清未來的模樣。=I really couldn't see what my future would be like.
自己想做什麼，該做什麼，完全不知道。=I had no idea what I wanted to do or what I should do.
但就是覺得，必須得做點什麼……=But I felt like I had to do something...
就把無處發洩的精力，\n都用在踩踏板上了。=So I poured all that pent-up energy into pedaling.
後來遇到了{{A}}，\n我才決定成為一名教師……=Later, I met {{A}} and decided to become a teacher...
但那個目標，是我自己決定的，\n因為我仰慕那個人。=But that goal was my own decision, \nit was because I admired him.
說到底，這是我自己選擇的道路。=In the end, it was a path I chose myself.
{{A}}只是等著我作出決定，\n在需要的時候幫我一把而已。={{A}} just waited for me to decide and helped me when I needed it.
我們{{A}}該做的，\n不是拉著學生的手送到終點。=What we teachers should do isn't pulling students by the hand to the finish line.
而是告訴他們自己有很多選擇，\n每條路應該怎麼走……=It's showing them they have many choices, \nand how each path might look...
最終要踏上旅程的，還是學生自己呢。=In the end, the students are the ones who have to walk it.
……這是{{A}}前不久跟我說的話，\n我只是借鑑啦！=...This is what {{A}} told me recently, \nI'm just borrowing his words!
心情舒暢了？=Feeling better now?
煩惱解開了？=All good now?
不過嘛，說不定哪天又會犯愁……\n到時候我就再去騎車囉。=But well, I might get worried again someday... When that happens, I'll just go cycling again.
到時候一起吧=Let's go together then
一定要邀請我哦=Be sure to invite me
{{A}}，謝謝！={{A}}, thanks!
總覺得啊……\n我身為{{A}}應該要更靠譜一點才行……=Somehow... I feel like I should be more reliable as a teacher...
可面對你，\n反而總是有點依賴你了。=But with you, I end up relying on you instead.
心裡有話要跟{{A}}說……=I have something to say to {{A}}...
{{A}}也是普通人={{A}} is only human
希望……被{{A}}依賴=<size\=21>I want... to be relied on by {{A}}</size>
確實是這樣……！\n但作為大人，還是想裝裝樣子嘛。=You're right...! But as an adult, I still want to keep up appearances.

喂，你別光點頭呀！=Hey, don't just nod!
真沒辦法！以後也多拜託你了。=Fine then! I'll count on you from now on too.
那麼！稍微再休息一下就回去吧。=Okay! Let's rest a bit more and then head back.

你還是學生，\n我不能用特別的眼光看待你。=You're still a student, \nI can't see you in a special light.
要是那樣做了……\n我就不是合格的{{A}}了。=If I did that... I wouldn't be a proper teacher anymore.

歸根結底，\n不能「只是為了水島同學」……=Ultimately, it shouldn't be "just for Mizushima-san"...
我覺得必須要為全體學生，\n營造一個能向教職人員求助的環境。=I feel we need to create an environment where all students feel comfortable seeking help from the faculty.

順便說一下哦……\n我已經詳細調查了這次活動的資訊。=By the way... I've already researched all the event details.

首先，關於為什麼要舉辦活動……\n是因為現在用戶數量一下子增加了不少。=First, why they're holding an event... It's because the user count suddenly increased.
據說是因為一位人氣主播的介紹，\n新玩家一下子就多了起來。=Apparently, a popular streamer mentioned the game, and lots of new players joined.
為了抓住這些新用戶，\n官方才準備了這次活動。=To engage these new users, the developers prepared this event.
順便說一下哦，雖然是新活動，\n但好像是過去某個活動的復刻版。=Oh, and though it's a new event, it's actually a rerun of a past one.
不過……\n就算是復刻也不能馬虎哦，男爵。=But... even if it's a revival, we can't slack off, Russet.

男爵都這麼說了，那一定信得過啦！=If Russet says so, it must be true!
好、好！\n一起加油吧！=O-Okay! \nLet's do our best together!
是哦，在能力範圍內盡全力就好了！=That's right, just do what you can!
對了，關於那個虛擬SKIN……\n它是作為「排名獎勵」發放的。=Right, about those skins... \nThey're "rank rewards."
參與者們會通過賺取積分來比拼。=Participants compete by earning points.
而且根據排名不同，\n皮膚的顏色和圖案也不一樣哦！=And depending on your rank, \nthe skin's color and design changes!
我瞄準的是……\n第3名的獎勵喲。=I'm aiming for... the 3rd place prize.
似乎是相當高的排名，\n才能獲得的獎勵……=It seems like a high-rank reward...
非常具有未來感和宇宙風格，\n設計超酷！=It's super futuristic and space-themed, \nthe design is so cool!
男爵肯定會喜歡的。\n雖然穿的人是我啦……=Russet would love it. \nEven though I'm the one who'd wear it...

你能這麼說我很高興呢。\n一直以來，我們都是攜手共進的嘛……=I'm glad you said that. \nWe've always pushed forward together...
我雖然想要那個SKIN和蔬菜騎士，\n但最讓我開心的還是能和你一起參加活動！=Though I want the skin and Vegetable Knights, what makes me happiest is participating with you!

比如去挖礦、收集物品，\n或者用友情點去兌換。=Like mining, collecting items, or exchanging friend points.
不過，最關鍵的是——\n「用農產品來兌換」！=But the most important method is- \n"exchanging produce"!

我還是老樣子，情緒不太穩定啊。\n這心態真是豆腐做的。=I'm still so emotionally unstable. \nMy mental state is like made of tofu.

因為在這裡種的話……分數會增加5倍！\n對提升排名相當有利！=Because planting here... gives a 5 times point multiplier! It'll really help with ranking!
當然原來的土地也會種一些，\n但還是把這邊當主力吧。=Of course, we'll still use the original fields too, but let's make this our main focus.
順便一提，雖然這一帶鬧哄哄的，\n但再往外走一些就是普通的田地了！=By the way, though this area is a bit noisy, \njust a bit further out are normal fields!

忙碌的時候沒時間思考，\n可一旦閑下來，就又開始胡思亂想了。=When I was busy, there's no time to think, but once I have free time, I started overthinking again.
我的工作並不是去「創造」些什麼，\n而是「守護」現有的東西。=My job isn't really to "create" anything, \nbut to "protect" what already exists.

聽著{{A}}充滿期待地描繪著未來，\n時間就這樣悄悄流逝了……=Time slipped by as I listened to {{A}} eagerly describe her future...

Hangouts
r:"^啊，(.*)，\n我今天準時下班了哦。$"="Ah, $1-san, I got off work on time today."
但１個人有點無聊……\n可以陪我一下嗎？=But it's a bit boring alone... \nCould you keep me company?
{{A}}，真的可以嗎？\n啊……雖然是我自己提出來的……={{A}}, really? Ah... though I was the one who asked...
決定和{{A}}一起出門……=I decided to go out with {{A}}...
臨時找你果然還是不太行吧。\n對不起啦，太強人所難了……=Asking you last minute probably isn't okay. \nSorry, that was too much to ask...

我最近在種香草，\n不過，種花的話也挺不錯的呢。=I've been growing herbs lately, but growing flowers seems nice too.
但是花嘛，總覺得有種……\n必須開得漂亮才行的壓力……=But with flowers, I feel this... pressure to make them bloom beautifully...
啊，不過這只是我個人的主觀看法啦。=Ah, but that's just my personal opinion.
像我這種經常工作到很晚的人，\n說不定會把花給養死……=Someone like me who often works late might end up killing them...
和花相比，香草感覺更不容易枯萎，\n所以門檻低多了。=Compared to flowers, herbs feel less likely to wither, so the barrier to entry is lower.
理解你的心情=<size\=28>I understand how you feel</size>
什麼時候挑戰下養花吧=<size\=25>Maybe try growing flowers someday</size>
r:"^(.*)也能理解嗎？真意外。\n感覺一下子拉近距離了……$"="$1-san understands too? That's unexpected. Feels like we've gotten closer..."
也是呢。如果能稍微沉下心來，\n精神上也有餘裕的話……=That's true. If I can calm down a bit and have some mental space...
對了，我之前在這裡買的羅勒，\n現在長得很好哦。=By the way, the basil I bought here before is growing really well now.
前些天稍微收穫了一點，\n試著用在料理上了。=The other day, I harvested a little and tried using it in cooking.
雖說是料理，其實也就是……\n在煮好的意面上放了點羅勒而已啦。=Though "cooking" is a strong word... \nI just put some basil on boiled pasta.
但總覺得……特別有感觸。\n有種陽光的味道。=But somehow... it felt special. \nLike it had a taste of sunlight.
雖然說來有點傻，\n但自己種出來的東西吃著就是不一樣。=It might sound silly, but things you grow yourself just taste different.
啊……在花店門口講吃的，\n好像有點不太合適呢……=Ah... talking about food in front of a flower shop might not be appropriate...

來啦……是不轉盤的壽司店呢。=Here we are... a conveyor belt sushi place.
畢竟都來東京了，\n總想體驗１次這種地方的美食。=Since coming to Tokyo, I wanted to try a place like this at least once.
但１個人踏入這裡的話，總覺得有點難……\n你能陪我一起來真的太好了。=But going in alone feels a bit daunting... \nI'm really glad you came with me.
啊當然，是我請客。\n請別客氣，隨便點吧。=Ah, of course, it's my treat. \nDon't hold back, order anything.
可以嗎？=Are you sure?
不太好吧=That doesn't feel right
r:"^我受到了(.*)很多照顧，\n偶爾也讓我表現下作為社會人士的一面吧。$"="I've relied on $1-san so much, let me act like a proper working adult for once."
別在意啦，在這種店裡，\n怎麼能讓高中生自掏腰包呢。=Don't worry about it. In a place like this, I can't let a high school student pay.
而且我……雖然看著這樣，\n但其實還是賺得不少的……=Besides... though I might not look it, \nI actually earn a decent amount...
我們公司雖然有點黑心，\n但加班費還是會正常給。=Our company might be a bit unscrupulous, \nbut they do pay overtime properly.
所以修羅場越是頻繁的時候，\n存款餘額也就越多啦。=So the more hectic it gets, \nthe more my savings grow.
雖然也因為修羅場太多，\n幾乎沒時間花錢……=Though because it's so hectic, \nI hardly have time to spend money...
所以偶爾得痛快地花一筆，\n不然反倒覺得有些浪費。=So I need to splurge occasionally, \notherwise it feels wasteful.
所以說啦，真的不要客氣，\n你吃得開心我也會高興。=Really, don't hold back. \nI'll be happy if you enjoy yourself.
r:"^不過……(.*)你太禮貌了，\n要你自己點貴的可能還是有點難吧？$"="But... you're too polite, so you might not order expensive things yourself?"
好——那就由我……\n打擾一下，請上兩貫藍鰭鮪魚大腹！=Okay- then I'll... Excuse me, two orders of bluefin tuna belly, please!
來來，隨便點你喜歡的吧。\n我也想偶爾表現一下大人的樣子嘛。=Here, order whatever you like. \nI want to act like an adult.

r:"^但我今天就是想和(.*)好好玩一玩，\n想看看你這個年紀應有的樣子。$"="But today, I just want to have fun with you and see what someone your age is like."
好久沒去遊戲廳了……自從學生時代以後，\n好像就沒去過了。最近流行什麼呢？=I haven't been to an arcade in ages... not since my student days. What's popular lately?
對了，我們去拍張大頭貼怎麼樣？=Right, how about we take a photo booth?
啊……對不起，我有點太放飛了。\n和高中生拍大頭貼什麼的簡直是犯罪……=Ah... sorry, I got carried away. Taking a photo booth with a high school student is practically a crime...

唔～不愧是你啊。\n人生軌跡果然跟我不一樣……！=Mmm～ As expected from you. Your life really is different from mine...!
